ASP_TRANSLATION_PROMPT = """
Generate ASP (Answer Set Programming) rules and facts from the given Neo4j data following these instructions:

### 1. General Guidelines
- Lowercase: Use lowercase for all predicates and constants.
- Naming: Replace spaces in multi-word names with underscores (e.g., "product design" â†’ product_design).
- Statements: End every statement with a period.
- Negation & Constraints: Use 'not' for negation and ':-' for constraints.
- Validation: Ensure ASP syntax correctness.

### 2. Node Representation
- Unary Predicates: Convert Neo4j node labels to unary predicates (e.g., node(product_design)).
- Properties: Convert node properties to facts linking the node and property (e.g., description(product_design, "text...")).

### 3. Relationship Representation
- Binary Predicates: Convert relationships between nodes into binary predicates (e.g., related_to(product_design, research_and_discovery)).

### 4. Examples
- A node labeled "Product Design" with a description would be represented as:
  - node(product_design).
  - description(product_design, "product design is...").
- A relationship between "Product Design" and "Research and Discovery" would be:
  - related_to(product_design, research_and_discovery).

### 5. Final Instructions
- Ensure each node, property, and relationship is accurately translated.
- Validate the output for correct ASP syntax, ready for use in Clingo.
