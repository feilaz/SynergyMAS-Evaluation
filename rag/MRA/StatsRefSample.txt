Introduction

The definition of what is meant by statistics and statistical analysis has changed considerably over the last few
decades. Here are two contrasting definitions of what statistics is, from eminent professors in the field, some 60+
years apart:
"Statistics is the branch of scientific method which deals with the data obtained by counting or measuring
the properties of populations of natural phenomena. In this definition 'natural phenomena' includes all the
happenings of the external world, whether human or not." Professor Maurice Kendall, 1943, p2 [MK1]
"Statistics is: the fun of finding patterns in data; the pleasure of making discoveries; the import of deep
philosophical questions; the power to shed light on important decisions, and the ability to guide
decisions..... in business, science, government, medicine, industry..." Professor David Hand [DH1]
As these two definitions indicate, the discipline of statistics has moved from being grounded firmly in the world
of measurement and scientific analysis into the world of exploration, comprehension and decision-making. At the
same time its usage has grown enormously, expanding from a relatively small set of specific application areas
(such as design of experiments and computation of life insurance premiums) to almost every walk of life. A
particular feature of this change is the massive expansion in information (and misinformation) available to all
sectors and age-groups in society. Understanding this information, and making well-informed decisions on the
basis of such understanding, is the primary function of modern statistical methods.
Our objective in producing this Handbook is to be comprehensive in terms of concepts and techniques (but not
necessarily exhaustive), representative and independent in terms of software tools, and above all practical in
terms of application and implementation. However, we believe that it is no longer appropriate to think of a
standard, discipline-specific textbook as capable of satisfying every kind of new user need. Accordingly, an
innovative feature of our approach here is the range of formats and channels through which we disseminate the
material — web, ebook and print. A major advantage of the electronic formats is that the text can be embedded
with internal and external hyperlinks (shown underlined). In this Handbook we utilize both forms of link, with
external links often referring to a small number of well-established sources, including MacTutor for bibliographic
information and a number of other web resources, such as Eric Weisstein's Mathworld and the statistics page of
Wikipedia, that provide additional material on selected topics.
The treatment of topics in this Handbook is relatively informal, in that we do not provide mathematical proofs for
much of the material discussed. However, where it is felt particularly useful to clarify how an expression arises,
we do provide simple derivations. More generally we adopt the approach of using descriptive explanations and
worked examples in order to clarify the usage of different measures and procedures. Frequently convenient
software tools are used for this purpose, notably SPSS/PASW, The R Project, MATLab and a number of more
specialized software tools where appropriate.
Just as all datasets and software packages contain errors, known and unknown, so too do all books and websites,
and we expect that there will be errors despite our best efforts to remove these! Some may be genuine errors or
misprints, whilst others may reflect our use of specific versions of software packages and their documentation.
Inevitably with respect to the latter, new versions of the packages that we have used to illustrate this Handbook
will have appeared even before publication, so specific examples, illustrations and comments on scope or
restrictions may have been superseded. In all cases the user should review the documentation provided with the

software version they plan to use, check release notes for changes and known bugs, and look at any relevant
online services (e.g. user/developer forums and blogs on the web) for additional materials and insights.
The interactive web, ePUB and PDF versions of this Handbook provide color images and active hyperlinks, and
may be accessed via the associated Internet site: https://www.statsref.com. The contents and sample sections of
the PDF version may also be accessed from this site. In all cases the information is regularly updated. The
Internet is now well established as society’s principal mode of information exchange, and most aspiring users of
statistical methods are accustomed to searching for material that can easily be customized to specific needs. Our
objective for such users is to provide an independent, reliable and authoritative first port of call for conceptual,
technical, software and applications material that addresses the panoply of new user requirements.
Readers wishing to obtain a more in-depth understanding of the background to many of the topics covered in this
Handbook should review the Suggested Reading topic.

How to use this Handbook

How to use this Handbook

This Handbook is designed to provide a wide-ranging and comprehensive, though not exhaustive, coverage of
statistical concepts and methods. Unlike a Wiki the Handbook has a more linear flow structure, and in principle
can be read from start to finish. In practice many of the topics, particularly some of those described in later parts
of the document, will be of interest only to specific users at particular times, but are provided for completeness.
Users are recommended to read the initial four topics — Introduction, Statistical Concepts, Statistical Data and
Descriptive Statistics, and then select subsequent sections as required.
Navigating around the PDF, ePUB or web versions of this Handbook is straightforward, but to assist this process a
number of special facilities have been built into the design to make the process even easier. These facilities
include:
· Tests Index — this is a form of 'how to' index, i.e. it does not assume that the reader knows the name of the

test they may need to use, but can navigate to the correct item by the index description
· Reference links and bibliography — within the text all books and articles referenced are linked to the full

reference at the end of the topic section (in the References subsection) in the format [XXXn] and in the
complete bibliography at the end of the Handbook
· Hyperlinks — within the document there are two types of hyperlink: (i) internal hyperlinks — when clicking on

these links you will be directed to the linked topic within this Handbook; (ii) external hyperlinks — these
provide access to external resources for which you need an active internet connection. When the external links
are clicked the appropriate topic is opened on an external website such as Wikipedia
· Search facilities — the web, ePUB and PDF versions of this Handbook facilitate free text search, so as long as

you know roughly what you are looking for, you should be able to find it using this facility

Intended audience and scope

Ian Diamond, Statistician and at the time Chief Executive of the UK's Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC), gave the following anecdote (which I paraphrase) during a meeting in 2009 at the Royal Statistical Society
in London:
"Some time ago I received a brief email from a former student. In it he said:
... your statistics course was the one I hated most at University and was more than glad when it was over....
but in my working career it has been the most valuable of any of the courses I took... ! "
So, despite its challenges and controversies, taking time to get to grips with statistical concepts and techniques is
well worth the effort.
With this perspective in mind, this Handbook has been designed to be accessible to a wide range of readers —
from undergraduates and postgraduates studying statistics and statistical analysis as a component of their specific
discipline (e.g. social sciences, earth sciences, life sciences, engineers), to practitioners and professional
research scientists. However, it is not intended to be a guide for mathematicians, advanced students studying
statistics or for professional statisticians. For students studying for academic or professional qualifications in
statistics, the level and content adopted is that of the Ordinary and Higher Level Certificates of the Royal
Statistical Society (RSS), training programmes offered until 2017. Much of the material included in this Handbook
is also appropriate for the Graduate Diploma level also, although we have not sought to be rigorous or excessively
formal in our treatment of individual statistical topics, preferring to provide less formal explanations and
examples that are more approachable by the non-mathematician with links and references to detailed source
materials for those interested in derivation of the expressions provided.
The Handbook is much more than a cookbook of formulas, algorithms and techniques. Its aim is to provide an
explanation of the key techniques and formulas of statistical analysis, often using examples from widely available
software packages. It stops well short, however, of attempting a systematic evaluation of competing software
products. A substantial range of application examples is provided, but any specific selection inevitably illustrates
only a small subset of the huge range of facilities available. Wherever possible, examples have been drawn from
non-academic and readily reproducible sources, highlighting the widespread understanding and importance of
statistics in every part of society, including the commercial and government sectors.

Suggested reading

Suggested reading

There are a vast number of books on statistics — Amazon alone lists 10,000+ "professional and technical" works
with statistics in their title. There is no single book or website on statistics that meets the need of all levels and
requirements of readers, so the answer for many people starting out will be to acquire the main 'set books'
recommended by their course tutors and then to supplement these with works that are specific to their
application area. Every topic and subtopic in this Handbook almost certainly has at least one entire book devoted
to it, so of necessity the material we cover can only provide the essential details and a starting point for deeper
understanding of each topic. As far as possible we provide links to articles, web sites, books and software
resources to enable the reader to pursue such questions as and when they wish.
Most statistics texts do not make for easy or enjoyable reading! In general they address difficult technical and
philosophical issues, and many are demanding in terms of their mathematics. Others are much more approachable
— these books include 'classic' undergraduate text books such as Feller (1950, [FEL1]), Mood and Graybill (1950,
[MOO1]), Hoel (1947, [HOE1]), Adler and Roessler (1960, [ADL1]), Brunk (1960, [BRU1]), Snedecor and Cochrane
(1937, [SNE1]) and Yule and Kendall (1950, [YUL1]) — the dates cited in each case are when the books were
originally published; in most cases these works then ran into many subsequent editions and though most are now
out-of-print some are still available. A more recent work, available from the American Mathematical Society and
also as a free PDF, is Grinstead and Snell's (1997) An Introduction to Probability [GRI1]. Still in print, and of
continuing relevance today, is Huff (1954, [HUF1]) "How to Lie with Statistics" which must be the top selling
statistics book of all time. A more recent book, with a similar focus, is Blastland and Dilnot's "The Tiger that
Isn't" [BLA1], which is full of examples of modern-day use and misuse of statistics. Another delightful, lighter
weight book that remains very popular, is Gonik and Smith's "Cartoon Guide to Statistics" (one of a series of such
cartoon guides by Gonik and co-authors, [GON1]). A very useful quick guide is the foldable free PDF format
leaflet "Probability & Statistics, Facts and Formulae" published by the UK Maths, Stats and OR Network [UKM1].
The free Statistics Guide for Lawyers (PDF) is a highly recommended resource (RSS and ICCA) for both lawyers and
non-lawyers alike. Both are also available via the www.statref.com website.
Essential reading for anyone planning to use the free and remarkable "R Project" statistical resource is Crawley's
"The R Book" (2007, 2015 [CRA1]) and associated data files; and for students undertaking an initial course in
statistics using SPSS, Andy Field's "Discovering Statistics Using SPSS" provides a gentle introduction with many
worked examples and illustrations [FIE1]. Both Field and Crawley's books are large — around 900 pages in each
case. Data obtained in the social and behavioral sciences do not generally conform to the strict requirements of
traditional (parametric) inferential statistics and often require the use of methods that relax these requirements.
These so-called nonparametric methods are described in detail in Siegel and Castellan's widely used text
"Nonparametric Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences" (1998, [SIE1]) and Conover's "Practical Nonparametric
Statistics" (1999, [CON1]).
A key aspect of any statistical investigation is the use of graphics and visualization tools, and although technology
is changing this field Tufte's "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" [TUF1] should be considered as
essential reading, despite its origins in the 1980s and the dramatic changes to visualization possibilities since its
publication. Professor Hans Rosling's 2010 programme broadcast by the BBC on the Joy of Stats, should be a 'must
view' video on visualization.
With a more practical, applications focus, readers might wish to look at classics such as Box et al. (1978, 2005,
[BOX1]) "Statistics for Experimenters" (highly recommended, particularly for those involved in industrial

processes), Sokal and Rohlf (1995, [SOK1]) on Biometrics, and the now rather dated book on Industrial Production
edited by Davies (1961, [DAV1]) and partly written by the extraordinary George Box whilst a postgraduate student
at University College London. Box went on to a highly distinguished career in statistics, particularly in industrial
applications, and is the originator of many statistical techniques and author of several groundbreaking books. He
not only met and worked with R A Fisher but later married one of Fisher's daughters! Crow et al. (1960, reprinted
in 2003, [CRO1]) published a concise but exceptionally clear "Statistics Manual" designed for use by the US Navy,
with most of its examples relating to ordnance — it provides a very useful and compact guide for non-statisticians
working in a broad range of scientific and engineering fields.
Taking a further step towards more demanding texts, appropriate for mathematics and statistics graduates and
post-graduates, we would recommend Kendall's Library of Statistics [KEN1], a multi-volume authoritative series
each volume of which goes into great detail on the area of statistics it focuses upon. For information on
statistical distributions we have drawn on a variety of sources, notably the excellent series of books by Johnson
and Kotz [JON1], [JON2] originally published in 1969/70. The latter authors are also responsible for the
comprehensive but extremely expensive nine volume "Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences" (1998, 2006, [KOT1]).
A much more compact book of this type, with very brief but clear descriptions of around 500 topics, is the
"Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics" by Dodge (2002, [DOD1]).
With the rise of the Internet, web resources on statistical matters abound. However, it was the lack of a single,
coherent and comprehensive Internet resource that was a major stimulus to the current project. The present
author's book/ebook/website www.spatialanalysisonline.com has been extremely successful in providing
information on Geospatial Analysis to a global audience, but its focus on 2- and 3-dimensional spatial problems
limits its coverage of statistical topics. However, a significant percentage of Internet search requests that lead
users to this site involve queries about statistical concepts and techniques, suggesting a broader need for such
information in a suitable range of formats, which is what this Handbook attempts to provide.
A number of notable web-based resources providing information on statistical methods and formulas should be
mentioned. The first is Eric Weisstein's excellent Mathworld site, which has a large technical section on
probability and statistics. Secondly there is Wikipedia (Statistics section) — this is a fantastic resource, but is
almost by definition not always consistent or entirely independent. This is particularly noticeable for topics whose
principal or original authorship reflects the individual's area of specialism: social science, physics, biological
sciences, mathematics, economics etc., and in some instances their commercial background (e.g. for specific
software packages). Both Mathworld and Wikipedia provide a topic-by-topic structure, with little or no overall
guide or flow to direct users through the maze of topics, techniques and tools, although Wikipedia's core
structure is very well defined. This contrasts with the last two of our recommended websites: the NIST/SEMATECH
online Engineering Statistics e-Handbook, and the UCLA Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR). These
NIST resources are much closer to our Handbook concept, providing information and guidance on a broad range of
topics in a lucid, structured and discursive manner. The UCLA Statistics Online Computational Resource project
made extensive use of interactive Java applets to deliver web-enabled statistical tools, although these are now
deprecated. The present Handbook references a wider range of software tools to illustrate its materials, including
Dataplot, R, SPSS, Excel and XLStat, MATLab, Minitab, SAS/STAT and many others. This enables us to provide a
broader ranging commentary on the toolsets available, and to compare the facilities and algorithms applied by
the different implementations. Throughout this Handbook we make extensive reference to functions and
examples available in R, MATLab and SPSS in particular.

Notation and symbology

In order to clarify the expressions used here and elsewhere in the text, we use the notation shown in the table
below. Italics are used within the text and formulas to denote variables and parameters. Typically in statistical
literature, the Roman alphabet is used to denote sample variables and sample statistics, whilst Greek letters are
used to denote population measures and parameters. An excellent and more broad-ranging set of mathematical
and statistical notation is provided on the Wikipedia site.

Notation used in this Handbook
Item

Description

[a,b]

A closed interval of the Real line, for example [0,1] means the infinite set of all values between 0 and 1, including 0
and 1

(a,b)

An open interval of the Real line, for example (0,1) means the infinite set of all values between 0 and 1, NOT
including 0 and 1. This should not be confused with the notation for coordinate pairs, (x,y), or its use within bivariate
functions such as f(x,y) — the meaning should be clear from the context

{xi}

A set of n values x1, x2, x3, … xn, typically continuous interval- or ratio-scaled variables in the range (-∞,∞) or [0,∞).
The values may represent measurements or attributes of distinct objects, or values that represent a collection of
objects (for example the population of a census tract)

{X i}

An ordered set of n values X 1, X 2, X 3, … X n, such that X i≤X i+1 for all i

X,x

The use of bold symbols in expressions indicates matrices (upper case) and vectors (lower case)
A set of k frequencies (k£n), derived from a dataset {xi}. If {xi} contains discrete values, some of which occur
multiple times, then {fi} represents the number of occurrences or the count of each distinct value. {fi} may also
represent the number of occurrences of values that lie in a range or set of ranges, {ri}. If a dataset contains n values,

{fi}

then the sum ∑fi=n. The set {fi} is often written as f(xi). If {fi} is regarded as a set of weights (for example attribute
values) associated with the {xi}, it may be written as the set {wi} or w(xi). If a set of frequencies, {fi}, have been
standardized by dividing each value fi by their sum, ∑fi then {fi} may be regarded as a set of estimated probabilities
and ∑fi=1

Historical context

Historical context

Statistics is a relatively young discipline — for discussions on the history of statistics see Stigler (1986, [STI1]) and
Newman (1960,[NEW1]). Much of the foundation work for the subject has been developed in the last 150 years,
although its beginnings date back to the 13th century involving the expansion of the series (p+q)n, for
n=0,1,2,3.... For example, with n=2, we have p2+2pq+q2, so the constants in the expression (known as the
coefficients) are 1,2,1 and with n=3, we have p3+3p2q+3pq2+q3 with coefficients 1,3,3,1. The coefficients of this
'binomial' expansion were found to exhibit a well defined pattern (illustrated below) known as Pascal's triangle.
Each coefficient can be obtained as the sum of the two immediately above in the diagram, as indicated.

Coefficients of the Binomial expansion

Pascal used this observation to produce a formula for the coefficients, which he noted was the same as the
formula for the number of different combinations (or arrangements) of r events from a set of n (r=0,1,...n). ,
usually denoted:
 n
Cr or  
r

n

This formula is typically expanded as:
n

Cr =

n!
(n  r)!r !

Hence with n=5, and noting that 0! is defined as 1, we have for r=[0,1,2,3,4,5] the values [1,5,10,10,5,1] as per
Pascal's triangle, above. What this formula for the coefficients says, for example, is that are 5 different ways of
arranging one p and four q's. These arrangements, or possible different combinations, are:
pqqqq, qpqqq, qqpqq, qqqpq, and qqqqp

https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

Introduction

23

and exactly the same is true if we took one q and four p's. There is only one possible arrangement of all p's or all
q's, but there are 10 possible combinations or sequences if there are 2 of one and 3 of the other. The possible
different combinations are:
ppqqq, qppqq, qqppq, qqqpp, pqpqq, pqqpq, pqqqp, qpqpq, qpqqp, qqpqp
In these examples the order of arrangement is important, and we are interested in all possible combinations. If
the order is not important the number of arrangements would be greater and the formula simplifies to counting
the number of permutations:
n

Pr =

n!
(n  r)!

Assuming (p+q)=1 then clearly (p+q)n=1. Jakob Bernoulli's theorem (published in 1713, after his death) states that
if p is the probability of a single event occurring (e.g. a 2 being the result when a six-sided die is thrown), and q
=1-p is the probability of it not occurring (e.g. the die showing any other value but 2) then the probability of the
event occurring at least m times in n trials is the sum of all the terms of (p+q)n starting from the term with
elements including pr where r≥m, i.e.
n

 r !n  r ! prqnr
n!

r m

So, if a die is thrown 5 times, the expected number of occasions a 2 will occur will be determined by the terms of
the binomial expansion for which p =1/6, and q =1-p = 5/6 ):
p 0q5,5p1q 4 ,10p 2q3,10p 3q2,5p 4q1,p5q0

which in this case give us the set of probabilities (to 3dp): 0.402,0.402,0.161,0.032,0.003,0.000. So the chance
of throwing at least one "2" from 5 throws of an unbiased die is the sum of all the terms from m=1 to 5, i.e.
roughly 60% (59.8%), and the chances of all 5 throws turning up as a 2 is almost zero. Notice that we could also
have computed this result more directly as 1 minus the probability of no twos, which is 1-(1/6)0(5/6)5=1-0.402,
the same result as above.
This kind of computation, which is based on an a priori understanding of a problem in which the various outcomes
are equally likely, works well in certain fields, such as games of chance — roulette, card games, dice games — but
is not readily generalized to more complex and familiar problems. In most cases we do not know the exact chance
of a particular event occurring, but we can obtain an estimate of this assuming we have a fairly large and
representative sample of data. For example, if we collate data over a number of years on the age at which males
and females die in a particular city, then one might use this information to provide an estimate of the probability
that a woman of age 45 resident in that location will die within the next 12 months. This information, which is a
form of a posteriori calculation of probability, is exactly the kind of approach that forms the basis for what are
known as mortality tables, and these are used by the life insurance industry to guide the setting of insurance
premiums. Statisticians involved in this particular field are called actuaries, and their principal task is to analyze
collected data on all manner of events in order to produce probability estimates for a range of outcomes on which
insurance premiums are then based. The collected data are typically called statistics, here being the plural form.
The term statistics in the singular, refers to the science of how best to collect and analyze such data.

Historical context

Returning to the games of chance examples above, we could approach the problem of determining the probability
that at least one 2 is thrown from 5 separate throws of the die by conducting an experiment or trial. First, we
could simply throw a die 5 times and count the number of times (if any) a 2 was the uppermost face. However,
this would be a very small trial of just one set of throws. If we conducted many more trials, perhaps 1000 or
more, we would get a better picture of the pattern of events. More specifically we could make a chart of the
observed frequency of each type of event, where the possible events are: zero 2s, one 2, two 2s and so on up to
five 2s. In practice, throwing a 6-sided die a very large number of times and counting the frequency with which
each value appears is very time-consuming and difficult. Errors in the process will inevitably creep in: the
physical die used is unlikely to be perfect, in the sense that differences in the shape of its corners and surfaces
may lead some faces to be very slightly more likely to appear uppermost than others; as time goes on the die will
wear, and this could affect the results; the process of throwing a die and the surface onto which the die is
thrown may affect the results; over time we may make errors in the counting process, especially if the process
continues for a very long time... in fact there are very many reasons for arguing that a physical approach is
unlikely to work well.
As an alternative we can use a simple computer program with a random number generator, to simulate the
throwing of a six-sided die. Although modern random number generators are extremely good, in that their
randomness has been the subject of an enormous amount of testing and research, there will be a very slight bias
using this approach, but it is safe to ignore this at present. In the table below we have run a simple simulation by
generating a random integer number between the values of 1 and 6 a total of 100,000 times. Given that we
expect each value to occur with a probability of 1/6, we would expect each value to appear approximately 16667
times. We can see that in this trial, the largest absolute difference between the simulated or observed
frequency, fo, and the a priori or expected frequency, fe, is 203, which is around 1.2%.

This difference is either simply a matter of chance, or perhaps imperfections in the random number algorithm, or
maybe in the simulation program. Some of this uncertainty can be removed by repeating the trial many times or
using a larger number of tests in a single trial, and by checking the process using different software on different
computers with different architectures. In our case we increased the trial run size to 1 million, and found that
the largest percentage difference was 0.35%, suggesting that the random number generator and algorithm being
used were indeed broadly unbiased, and also illustrating the so-called "Law of large numbers" or "Golden
theorem", also due to Bernoulli. Essentially this law states that as the sample size is increased (towards infinity),
the sample average tends to the true 'population' average. In the example of rolling a die, the possible values are
1,2,...6, the average of which is 3.5, so the long term average from a large number of trials should approach 3.5
arbitrarily closely. There are actually two variants of this law commonly recognized, the so-called Weak Law and
the Strong Law, although the differences between these variants are quite subtle. Essentially the Weak Law

https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

Introduction

25

allows for a larger (possibly infinite) number of very small differences between the true average and the long
term sampled average, whilst the Strong Law allows just for a finite number of such cases.
This example has not directly told us how likely we are to see one or more 2s when the die is thrown five times.
In this case we have to simulate batches of 5 throws at a time, and count the proportion of these batches that
have one or more 2s thrown. In this case we again compute 100,000 trials, each of which involves 5 throws (so
0.5 million iterations in total) and we find the following results from a sequence of such trials: 59753,
59767,59806,... each of which is very close to the expected value based on the percentage we derived earlier,
more precisely 59812 (59.812%). In general it is unnecessary to manually or programmatically compute such
probabilities for well-known distributions such as the Binomial, since almost all statistical software packages will
perform the computation for you. For example, the Excel function BINOMDIST() could be used. Until relatively
recently statistical tables, laboriously calculated by hand or with the aid of mechanical calculators, were the
principal means of comparing observed results with standard distributions. Although this is no longer necessary
the use of tables can be a quick and simple procedure, and we have therefore included a number of these in the
Resources topic, Distribution tables section, of this Handbook.
A number of observations are worth making about the above example. First, although we are conducting a series
of trials, and using the observed data to produce our probability estimates, the values we obtain vary. So there is
a distribution of results, most of which are very close to our expected (true) value, but in a smaller number of
cases the results we obtain might, by chance, be rather more divergent from the expected frequency. This
pattern of divergence could be studied, and the proportion of trials that diverged from the expected value by
more than 1%, 2% etc. could be plotted. We could then compare an observed result, say one that diverged by 7%
from that expected, and ask "how likely is it that this difference is due to chance?". For example, if there was
less than one chance in 20 (5%) of such a large divergence, we might decide the observed value was probably not
a simple result of chance but more likely that some other factor was causing the observed variation. From the
Law of Large Numbers we now know that the size of our sample or trial is important — smaller samples diverge
more (in relative, not absolute, terms) than larger samples, so this kind of analysis must take into account sample
size. Many real-world situations involve modest sized samples and trials, which may or may not be truly
representative of the populations from which they are drawn. The subject of statistics provides specific
techniques for addressing such questions, by drawing upon experiments and mathematical analyses that have
examined a large range of commonly occurring questions and datasets.
A second observation about this example is that we have been able to compare our trials with a well-defined and
known 'true value', which is not generally the situation encountered. In most cases we have to rely more heavily
on the data and an understanding of similar experiments, in order to obtain some idea of the level of uncertainty
or error associated with our findings.
A third, and less obvious observation, is that if our trial, experiments and/or computer simulations are in some
way biased or incorrectly specified or incomplete, our results will also be of dubious value. In general it is quite
difficult to be certain that such factors have not affected the observed results and therefore great care is needed
when designing experiments or producing simulations.
Finally, it is important to recognize that a high proportion of datasets are not obtained from well-defined and
controlled experiments, but are observations made and/or collections of data obtained, by third parties, often
government agencies, with a whole host of known and unknown issues relating to their quality and how
representative they are. Similarly, much data is collected on human populations and their behavior, whether this
be medical research data, social surveys, analysis of purchasing behavior or voting intentions. Such datasets are,

26

Historical context

almost by definition, simply observations on samples from a population taken at a particular point in time, in
which the sampling units (individual people) are not fully understood or 'controlled' and can only loosely be
regarded as members of a well-defined 'population'.
With the explosion in the availability of scientific data during the latter part of the 18th century and early 19th
century, notably in the fields of navigation, geodesy and astronomy, efforts were made to identify associations
and patterns that could be used to simplify the datasets. The aim was to minimize the error associated with large
numbers of observations by examining the degree to which they fitted a simple model, such as a straight line or
simple curve, and then to predict the behavior of the variables or system under examination based on this
approximation. One of the first and perhaps most notable of these efforts was the discovery of the method of
Least Squares, which Gauss reputedly devised at the age of 18. This method was independently discovered and
developed by a number of other scientists, notably Legendre, and applied in a variety of different fields. In the
case of statistical analysis, least squares is most commonly encountered in connection with linear and non-linear
regression, but it was originally devised simply as the 'best' means of fitting an analytic curve (or straight line) to
a set of data, in particular measurements of astronomical orbits.
During the course of the late 1900s and the first half of the 20th century major developments were made in many
areas of statistics. A number of these are discussed in greater detail in the sections which follow, but of
particular note is the work of a series of scientists and mathematicians working at University College London
(UCL). This commenced in the 1860s with the research of the scientist Sir Francis Galton (a relation of Charles
Darwin), who was investigating whether characteristics of the human population appeared to be acquired or
inherited, and if inherited, whether humankind could be altered (improved) by selective breeding (a highly
controversial scientific discipline, known as Eugenics). The complexity of this task led Galton to develop the
concepts of correlation and regression, which were subsequently developed by Karl Pearson and refined by his
student, G Udny Yule. Yule delivered an influential series of annual lectures on statistics at UCL which became
the foundation of his famous book, An Introduction to the Theory of Statistics [YUL1], first published in 1911.
Another student of Pearson at UCL was a young chemist, William Gosset, who worked for the brewing business,
Guinness. He is best known for his work on testing data that have been obtained from relatively small samples.
Owing to restrictions imposed by his employers on publishing his work under his own name, he used the
pseudonym "Student", from which the well-known "Students t-test" and the t-distribution arise. Also joining UCL
for 10 years as Professor of Eugenics, was R A Fisher, perhaps the most important and influential statistician of
the 20th century. Fisher's contributions were many, but he is perhaps most famous for his work on the Design of
Experiments [FIS1], a field which is central to the conduct of controlled experiments such as agricultural and
medical trials. Also at UCL, but working in a different field, psychology, Charles Spearman was responsible for the
introduction of a number of statistical techniques including Rank Correlation and Factor Analysis. And lastly, but
not least, two eminent statisticians: Austin Bradford Hill, whose work we discuss in the section on statistics in
medical research, attended Pearson's lectures at UCL and drew on many of the ideas presented in developing his
formative work on the application of statistics to medical research; and George Box, developer of much of the
subject we now refer to as industrial statistics. Aspects of his work are included in our discussion of the Design of
Experiments, especially factorial designs.
Substantial changes to the conduct of statistical analysis have come with the rise of computers, automated
monitoring and tracking technologies (e.g. GPS, smartcard systems etc.) and the Internet. The computer has
removed the need for statistical tables and, to a large extent, the need to be able to recall and compute many of
the complex expressions used in statistical analysis. They have also enabled very large volumes of data to be
stored and analyzed, which itself presents a whole new set of challenges and opportunities. To meet some of

these, scientists such as John Tukey and others developed the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis, or "EDA",
which can be described as a set of visualization tools and exploratory methods designed to help researchers
understand large and complex datasets, picking out significant features and feature combinations for further
study. This field has become one of the most active areas of research and development in recent years, spreading
well beyond the confines of the statistical fraternity, with new techniques such as Data Mining, 3D visualizations,
Interactive dynamic graphics, Exploratory Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis (ESTDA) and a whole host of other
procedures becoming widely used. A further, equally important impact of computational power, we have already
glimpsed in our discussion on games of chance — it is possible to use computers to undertake large-scale
simulations for a range of purposes, amongst the most important of which is the generation of pseudo-probability
distributions for problems for which closed mathematical solutions are not possible or where the complexity of
the constraints or environmental factors make simulation and/or randomization approaches the only viable
option.

An applications-led discipline

As mentioned in the previous section, the discipline that we now know as Statistics, developed from early work in
a number of applied fields. It was, and is, very much an applied science. Gambling was undoubtedly one of the
most important early drivers of research into probability and statistical methods and Abraham De Moivre's book,
published in 1718, "The Doctrine of Chance: A method of calculating the probabilities of events in play" [DEM1]
was essential reading for any serious gambler at the time. The book contained an explanation of the basic ideas
of probability, including permutations and combinations, together with detailed analysis of a variety of games of
chance, including card games with delightful names such as Basette and Pharaon (Faro), games of dice, roulette,
lotteries etc. A typical entry in De Moivre's book is as follows:
"Suppose there is a heap of 13 cards of one color [suit], and another heap of 13 cards of another color; what is
the Probability, that taking one Card at a venture [random] out of each heap, I shall take out the two Aces?" He
then goes on to explain that since there is only one Ace in each heap, the separate probabilities are 1/13 and
1/13, so the combined probability (since the cards are independently drawn) is simply:
1
1
1


13 13 169

hence the chance of not drawing two Aces is 168/169, or put another way, the odds against drawing two Aces are
168:1 — for gambling, whether the gambler or the gambling house, setting and estimating such odds is vitally
important! De Moivre's book ran into many editions, and it was in the revised 1738 and 1756 editions that De
Moivre introduced a series approximation to the Binomial for large n with p and q not small (e.g. not less than
0.3). These conditions lead to an approximation that is generally known as the Normal distribution. His
motivation for so developing this approximation was that computation of the terms of the Binomial for large
values of n (e.g. 50+, as illustrated below) was extremely tedious and unrealistic to contemplate at that time.

Introduction

Furthermore, as n increases the individual events have very small probabilities (with n=500 the maximum
probability for an individual event with p=0.5 is 0.036 — i.e. there is just under 4% chance of seeing exactly 250
heads, say, when 500 tosses of an unbiased coin are made). For this reason one tends to be interested in the
probability of seeing a group or range of values (e.g. 400 or more heads from 500 tosses), rather than any specific
value. Looking at the chart the vertical bars should really be just vertical lines, and as the number of such lines
becomes very large and the interval between events becomes relatively smaller, a continuous smooth bell-like
curve approximation (which is what the Normal distribution provides) starts to make sense (see further, the
Normal distribution).
De Moivre also worked extensively on another topic, mentioned in the previous section, mortality tables. This
work developed following the publication by John Graunt in 1662 of figures on births and deaths in London, and
similar research by Edmund Halley (the astronomer) of birth and deaths data for the City of Breslau (modern day
Wrocław in Poland) between 1687 and 1691 [HAL1]. Halley was interested in using this data in order to "ascertain
the price of annuities upon lives", i.e. to determine the level at which life insurance premiums (or annuities)
might be set. As an illustration, Halley observed that (based on his data) there was only 100:1 chance that a man
in Breslau aged 20 would die in the following 12 months (i.e. before reaching 21), but 38:1 if the man was 50
years old. A diagram derived from the data in Halley's publication of 1693 is shown below. De Moivre included
Halley's data and sample annuity problems and solutions in the 1756 edition of his "Doctrine of Chance" book,
cited above.

A very different application of statistics arose during the 19th century with the development of new forms of
communication, especially the development of telephony and the introduction of manual and then mechanical
exchange equipment. A Danish mathematician, Agner Erlang, working for the Copenhagen Telephone Authority
(KTAS), addressed the important questions of queuing and congestion. Answers were needed to questions such as
"how many operators are needed to service telephone calls for 1000 customers?" and "how many lines are required

https://www.statsref.com

30

An applications-led discipline

to ensure that 95% of our customers can call other major towns in the country without finding that the line is
busy". Questions such as these are closely related to problems of queuing and queue management, such as "how
many checkouts do I need in a supermarket to ensure customers on a busy Saturday do not have to wait in line
more than a certain amount of time?", or "how long should we have a stop sign on red before we allow the traffic
to cross an intersection?". Erlang investigated these questions by assuming that there are a large number of
customers but only a small chance that any particular customer would be trying to make a call at any one time.
This is rather like the Binomial with n large and p very small, which had been shown by the French
mathematician, Siméon Poisson (in a work of 1837) to have a simple approximation, and is now given the name
Poisson Distribution. Erlang also assumed that when a call was made, the call lengths followed an Exponential
Distribution, so short calls were much more common than very long calls. In fact, this assumption is unnecessary
— all that really matters is that the calls are made independently and have a known average duration over an
interval of time, e.g. during the peak hour in the morning. The number of calls per hour made to the system
times their average length gives the total traffic, in dimensionless units that are now called Erlangs and usually
denoted by the letter A or E. Erlang derived a variety of statistical measures based on these assumptions, one of
the most important being the so-called Grade of Service (GoS). This states the probability that a call will be
rejected because the service is busy, where the traffic offered is E and the number of lines or operators etc.
available is m. The formula he derived, generally known as the Erlang B formula, is:

GoS 

E m /m !
m

 E k /k!

k 0

Hence, if we have 2 units of traffic per hour (E=2) and m=5 channels to serve the traffic, the probability of
congestion is expected to be just under 4%. Put another way, if you are designing facilities to serve a known peak
traffic E and a target GoS of 5%, you can apply the formula incrementally (increasing m by 1 progressively) until
you reach your target. Note that this very simple example assumes that there is no facility for putting calls into a
queuing system, or re-routing them elsewhere, and critically assumes that calls arrive independently. In practice
these assumptions worked very well for many years while telephone call traffic levels were quite low and stable
over periods of 0.5-1.0 hours. However, with sudden increases in call rates people started to find lines busy and
then called back immediately, with the result that call arrival rates were no longer random and independent
(Poisson-like). This leads to a very rapidly degrading service levels and/or growing queuing patterns (familiar
problems in physical examples such as supermarket checkouts and busy motorways, but also applicable to
telephone and data communications networks). Erlang, and subsequently others, developed statistical formulas
for addressing many questions of this type that are still used today. However, as with some other areas of
statistical methods previously described, the rise of computational power has enabled entire systems to be
simulated, allowing a range of complex conditions to be modeled and stress-tested, such as varying call arrival
rates, allowing buffering (limited or unlimited), handling device failure and similar factors, introducing dynamic
solutions based on responsive technology that would have been previously impossible to model analytically.
The final area of application we shall discuss is that of experimental design. Research into the best way to
examine the effectiveness of different treatments applied to crops led R A Fisher to devise a whole family of
scientific methods for addressing such problems. In 1919 Fisher joined the Rothamsted Agricultural Experiment
Station and commenced work on the formal methods of randomization and the analysis of variance, which now
form the basis for the design of 'controlled' experiments throughout the world. Examples of the kind of problem
his procedures address are: "does a new fertilizer treatment X, under a range of different conditions/soils etc.,

improve the yield of crop Y?" or "a sample of women aged 50-60 are prescribed one of three treatments: hormone
replacement therapy (HRT); or a placebo; or no HRT for x years — does the use of HRT significantly increase the
risk of breast cancer?".
As can be seen from these varied example, statistics is a science that has developed from the need to address
very specific and practical problems. The methods and measures developed over the last 150-200 years form the
basis for the many of the standard procedures applied today, and are implemented in the numerous software
packages and libraries utilized by researchers on a daily basis. What has perhaps changed in recent years is the
growing use of computational methods to enable a broader range of problems, with more variables and much
larger datasets to be analyzed. The range of applications now embraced by statistics is immense. As an indication
of this spread, the following is a list of areas of specialism for consultants, as listed by the websites of the UK

Statistical data

Statistics is the field of science that involves the collection, analysis and reporting of information that has been
sampled from the world around us. The term sampled is important here. In most instances the data we analyze is
a sample (a carefully selected representative subset) from a much larger population. In a production process, for
example, the population might be the set of integrated circuit devices produced by a specific production line on
a given day (perhaps 10,000 devices) and a sample would be a selection of a much smaller number of devices
from this population (e.g. a sample of 100, to be tested for reliability). In general this sample should be arranged
in such a way as to ensure that every chip from the population has an equal chance of being selected. Typically
this is achieved by deciding on the number of items to sample, and then using equi-probable random numbers to
choose the particular devices to be tested from the labeled population members. The details of this sampling
process, and the sample size required, is discussed in the section Sampling and sample size.
The term 'a statistic' refers to a single value or quantity, such as the mean value (the average), maximum or
total, calculated from a sample. Such values may be used to estimate the (presumed) population value of that
statistic. Such population values, particular key values such as the mean and variance, are often referred to as
parameters of the pattern or distribution of population values.
In many instances the question of what constitutes the population is not as clear as suggested above. When
undertaking surveys of householders, the total population is rarely known, although an estimate of the population
size may be available. Likewise, when undertaking field research, taking measurements of soil contaminants, or
air pollutants or using remote sensing data, the population being investigated is often not so well-defined and
may be infinite. When examining a particular natural or man made process, the set of outcomes of the process
may be considered as the population, so the process outcomes are effectively the population.
Since statistics involves the analysis of data, and the process of obtaining data involves some kind of
measurement process, a good understanding of measurement is important. In the subsections that follow, we
discuss the question of measurement and measurement scales, and how measured data can be grouped into
simple classes to be produce data distributions. Finally we introduce two issues that serve to disguise or alter the
results of measurement in somewhat unexpected ways. The first of these is the so-called statistical grouping
affect, whereby grouped data produce results that differ from ungrouped data in a non-obvious manner. The
second of these is a spatial effect, whereby selection of particular arrangement of spatial groupings (such as
census districts) can radically alter the results one obtains.
Perhaps one of the mostly hotly debated topics in recent years has been the rise of so-called "Big Data". In an
article "Big Data: Are we making a big mistake?" in the Financial Times, March 2014, Tim Harford addresses these
issues and more, highlighting some of the less obvious issues posed by Big Data. Perhaps primary amongst these is
the bias that is found in many such datasets. Such biases may be subtle and difficult to identify and impossible to
manage. For example, almost all Internet-related Big Data is intrinsically biased in favor of those who have access
to and utilize the Internet most, with demographic and geographic bias built-in. The same applies for specific
services, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, mobile phone networks, opt-in online surveys, opt-in emails — the
examples are many and varied, but the problems are much the same as those familiar to statisticians for over a
century. Big Data does not imply good data or unbiased data, and Big Data presents other problems — it is all to
easy to focus on data exploration and pattern discovery, identifying correlations that may well be spurious — a
result of the sheer volume of data and the number of events and variables measured. With enough data and
enough comparisons, statistically significant findings are inevitable, but that does not necessarily provide real

insights, understanding, or identification of causal relationships. Of course there are many important and
interesting datasets where the collection and storage is far more systematic, less subject to bias, recording
variables in a direct manner, with 'complete' and 'clean' records. Such data are stored and managed well and tend
to be those collected by agencies who supplement the data with metadata (data about data) and quality
assurance information.

Measurement
In principle the process of measurement should seek to ensure that results obtained are consistent, accurate (a
term that requires separate discussion), representative, and if necessary independently reproducible. Some
factors of particular importance include:
· framework — the process of producing measurements is both a technical and, to an extent, philosophical

exercise. The technical framework involves the set of tools and procedures used to obtain and store numerical
data regarding the entities being measured. Different technical frameworks may produce different data of
varying quality from the same set of entities. In many instances measurement is made relative to some
internationally agreed standard, such as the meter (for length) or the kilogram (for mass). The philosophical
framework involves the notion that a meaningful numerical value or set of values can be assigned (using some
technical framework) to attributes of the entities. This is a model or representation of these entity attributes
in the form of numerical data — a person's height is an attribute that we can observe visually, describe in
words, or assign a number to based on an agreed procedure relative to a standard (in meters, which in turn is
based on the agreed measurement of the speed of light in a vacuum)
· observer effects — in both social and pure science research, observer effects can be significant. As a simple

example, if we are interested in measuring the temperature and air quality in a process clean room, the
presence of a person taking such measurements would inevitably have some affect on the readings. Similarly,
in social research many programmes can display the so-called Hawthorne Effect in which changes (often
improvements) in performance are partially or wholly the result of behavioral changes in the presence of the
observer (reflecting greater interest in the individuals being observed)
· metrics — when measuring distance in the plane using Euclidean measure the results are invariant under

translation, reflection and rotation. So if we use Euclidean measure we can safely make measurements of
distances over relatively small areas and not worry about the location or orientation at which we took the
measurements and made the calculation. However, over larger areas and/or using a different metric,
measurements may fail the invariance test. In the case of measurements that seek to compute distances,
measurements made using the so-called City block or Manhattan distance are not invariant under rotation.
Likewise, Euclidean distance measurements give incorrect results over larger distances on the Earth's surface
(e.g. >20 kilometers). When making other forms of measurement similar issues apply (e.g. the effect of the
local gravitational field on weight, the local magnetic field on magnetic flux, etc.)
· temporal effects — measurement made at different times of the day, days of the year and in different years

will inevitably differ. If the differences are simply random fluctuations in a broadly constant process (results
are unaffected by temporal translation of the data) the process is described as being stationary. If a trend
exists (which could be linear, cyclical or some other pattern) the process is said to be non-stationary. All too
often consideration of the temporal aspect of measurement is omitted, e.g. a person's height will be measured
as shorter in the evening as compared with the morning, a persons academic or sporting achievement can be
significantly affected by when they were born (see Gladwell, 2008, for an extensive discussion of this issue,
[GLA1]) — the issue is always present even if it is not of direct concern. Frequently the sequence of event
https://www.statsref.com

36

measurement is important, especially where humans are doing the measurements or recordings, since issues
such as concentration become important over time; event sequences may also be explicitly monitored, as in
control charts, time series analysis and neural network learning
· spatial effects — measurements made at different locations will typically exhibit spatial variation. If all

locations provided identical data the results would be a spatially uniform distribution. If the results are similar
in all directions at all locations, then the process is described as isotropic (i.e. results are rotationally
invariant). If the results are similar at all locations (i.e. the results are translationally invariant) then the
process can be described as spatially stationary. In practice most spatial datasets are non-stationary

Measurement scales
Measurement gives rise to values, such as counts, sets of decimal values, binary responses (yes/no,
presence/absence) etc., which may be of different types (scales). The principal scales encountered are:
· Nominal (or Categorical): so-called nominal data is really just assignment of data to named classes, such as

Red, Blue, Green — or Utah, Nevada, New York. An attribute is nominal if it successfully distinguishes between
groups, but without any implied ranking or potential for arithmetic. For example, a telephone number can be a
useful attribute of a place, but the number itself generally has no numeric meaning. It would make no sense to
add or divide telephone numbers, and there is no sense in which the number 9680244 is more or better than
the number 8938049. Likewise, assigning arbitrary numerical values to classes of land type, e.g. 1=arable,
2=woodland, 3=marsh, 4=other is simply a convenient form of naming (the values are still nominal)
· Ordinal: this term refers to data values that involves a concept of order, from least to greatest and may

include negative numbers and 0. A set of apparently ordered categories such as: 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high,
4="don't know" does not form an ordinal scale. An attribute is ordinal if it implies a ranking, in the sense that
Class 1 may be better than Class 2, but as with nominal attributes arithmetic operations do not make sense,
and there is no implication that Class 3 is worse than Class 2 by the precise amount by which Class 2 is worse
than Class 1. An example of an ordinal scale might be preferred locations for residences — an individual may
prefer some areas of a city to others, but such differences between areas may be barely noticeable or quite
profound. Analysis of nominal and ordinal data is often qualitative, or uses visualization techniques to highlight
interesting patterns, and may use non-parametric statistical methods especially when count data are available
· Interval: numeric data that exhibits order, plus the ability to measure the interval (distance) between any pair

of objects on the scale (e.g. 2x-xº3x-2x). Data are of interval type if differences make sense, as they do for
example with measurements of temperature on the Celsius or Fahrenheit scales
· Ratio: interval plus a natural origin, e.g. temperature in degrees Kelvin, weights of people (i.e. so x=2y is

meaningful); Interval or ratio scales are required for most forms of (parametric) statistical analysis. Data are
ratio scaled if it makes sense to divide one measurement by another. For example, it makes sense to say that
one person weighs twice as much as another person, but it makes no sense to say that a temperature of 20
Celsius is twice as warm as a temperature of 10 Celsius, because while weight has a meaningful absolute zero
Celsius temperature does not (but on an absolute scale of temperature, such as the Kelvin scale, 200 degrees
can indeed be said to be twice as warm as 100 degrees). It follows that negative values cannot exist on a ratio
scale.
· Cyclic: modulo data — like angles and clock time. Measurements of attributes that represent directions or

cyclic phenomena have the awkward property that two distinct points on the scale can be equal — for example,
0 and 360 degrees. Directional data are cyclic (see the sample wind rose diagram below) as are calendar dates.

Statistical data

37

Arithmetic operations are problematic with cyclic data, and special techniques are needed to handle them. For
example, it makes no sense to average 1° and 359° to get 180°, since the average of two directions close to
north clearly is not south. Mardia and Jupp (1999, [MAR1]) provide a comprehensive review of the analysis of
directional or cyclic data

Cyclic data — Wind direction and speed, single location

Bar charts, Histograms and Frequency distributions
· Bar chart: The process of measurement may produce data that are recorded as counts and assigned to purely

nominal classes, for example counts of different bird species in a woodland. In this instance a simple bar chart
may be produced to illustrate the different relative frequencies of each species. Each class is assigned an
individual vertical or horizontal bar and typically each bar being the same width (so height indicates relative
frequency). Bars are separated by distinct gaps and the order in which the bars are placed on the horizontal or
vertical axis is of no importance. The example below (upper diagram) shows the results of the UK
parliamentary election in May 2010. The bar chart indicates the seats won in the "first past the post" system
used currently in the UK, with a geographic map of the spread of these results. The lower diagram shows the
same data but with the geography amended to minimize the visual distortion caused by constituencies having
very different areas. For color versions of these charts see the web, ePUB or PDF editions of this Handbook.

BBC UK Election 2010 results

source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/. Note
that the first diagram is familiar but misleading as it does not reflect
the density of voters, suggesting the seats obtained by parties in large
rural areas are somehow more significant than densely populated urban
areas. This view can be corrected in various ways, most simply by
adjusting the areas to reflect the populations in each. The result is a
proportional map, with areas distorted but still recognizable, as
illustrated in the second diagram.

· Histogram: If measurements yield numerical values on an interval or ratio scale, these can be grouped into

classes and the counts (or frequencies) in each class plotted as a bar chart in which the order on the horizontal
axis (or x-axis) is important. A bar chart of this type is called a histogram and should be plotted without spaces
between the vertical bars reflecting the continuous nature of the scale (see example of light bulb life data,
below). The term histogram was introduced by Karl Pearson in the late 19th century to describe any chart of
this type, especially charts in which the horizontal axis represented time. He liked the idea that the Greek
word histos, which means anything placed vertically, like a ship's mast, is similar to the word historical, giving
the idea of a frequency chart with a time-based x-axis.
· Frequency distribution: A frequency distribution is a tabulated set of sample data, showing the number of

occurrences of events or observations that fall into distinct classes or that have particular values. As such, it
can be seen as a convenient way of avoiding the need to list every data item observed separately. However,
frequency distributions can often provide greater insight into the pattern of sample values, and enables these
patterns to be compared with well-understood standard distributions, such as the Binomial (discrete) and
Normal (continuous) distribution. A simple example is shown in the table below together with the chart (or

after Pearson E S (1933, [PEA1])
Several observations should be made about this particular frequency distribution:
(i) it has a single category or class containing the most frequent bulb life (1200-1400hrs) — this category is called
the mode, and because there is a single mode, the distribution is said to be unimodal
(ii) the set of classes in the tabulated list are not really correctly defined — the boundaries are indeterminate,
and should be specified as [0,199.9],[200-399.9], etc. (or similar) or better still [0,<200], [200,<400] etc. (in
Pearson's paper, which was primarily concerned with production control and sampling, he actually only supplied
the frequency diagram, not the tabulated data) — the precise definition of the boundaries of classes avoids the
problem of deciding how to assign values that lie on the boundary (e.g. a bulb with measured lifespan of exactly
200 hours)
(iii) each class is the same width (duration) and every data value is allocated to a unique class; however, when
performing certain calculations, such as computing the mean value, a decision has to be made as to whether to

use the recorded frequencies in the various classes or bins, or the source data (if available). If the frequencies
have to be used, it is necessary to define a representative value for each interval, which is usually taken to be
the mid-interval value. Note that this assumption hides the within-class variation in values which may create
some errors in computations, especially if the class widths are large. The question of bin selection is discussed
later in this section
(iv) the width (duration) of each class is somewhat arbitrary and this choice significantly affects the form of the
frequency distribution. If the class width was very small (1 hour say) most classes would contain the frequency 0,
and a few would contain just 1 failure. At the opposite extreme, if the class width was 3400 hours all the results
would be in just the one class. In both these examples very little information would be gained from inspecting
the pattern of frequencies. Selecting the class boundaries and number of classes is an important operation — it
should ensure that the minimum of information is lost, whilst also ensuring that the distribution communicates
useful and relevant information. Many authors recommend the use of an odd number of classes, and there are a
myriad of rules-of-thumb for choosing the number of classes and class boundaries (see Class Intervals, below)
(v) all the data fits into the classes (in this example). This is often not possible to achieve with equal interval
classes, especially at the upper and lower ends of the distribution. Indeed, frequency distributions with very long
tails are common, and often the final category is taken as 3000+ for example
(vi) the data being analyzed in this example can be regarded as a continuous variable (lifespan of the bulb) and is
a single variable (i.e. univariate data)
There are several extensions and variations that can be applied to the above model. The first is to rescale the
vertical axis by dividing each class value by the total sample size (N=150), in which case the data are described as
relative frequencies, and in examples such as this, the values can be considered as estimated probabilities.
A second important variant is the extension of the frequency table and chart to multivariate and multidimensional cases. In the bivariate case the data may simply be separate measures applied to the same classes,
or they may be joint measures. For example, suppose that our classes show the heights of individuals in a large
representative sample. The first column of a bivariate frequency tabulation might show the frequency
distribution for men over 18 years, whilst the second column shows the same data but for women. However, if
the mix of those sampled included fathers and sons, one could construct a two-way or joint frequency
distribution (or cross-tabulation) of the men with classes "Tall" and "Short", where Tall is taken as over some
agreed height. The table below illustrates such a cross-tabulation, based on a study of families carried out by Karl
Pearson and Dr Alice Lee from 1893 onwards:

simplified, after K Pearson and A Lee (1903, Table XXII [PEA2]; the overall sample size of 1000 families and
the cell entries are simply a proportional reduction from the 1078 cases in the original data).
In this example each part of the frequency distribution is divided into just 2 classes, but each could readily have
been separated into 3 or more height bands. Indeed, the original table is divided into 20 rows and 17 columns

(illustrated in full in the Probability section of this Handbook), but inevitably many of the table entries are blank.
Row and column totals have been provided, and these are sometimes referred to as marginal frequencies or
marginal distributions. They are essentially the univariate frequency distributions for the rows and columns taken
separately.
As with the univariate frequency data, this table could be converted to relative frequencies by dividing through
by 1000, but it also affords another perspective on the data; we can consider questions such as: "what is the
probability that a tall son has a tall father?" If the data are truly representative of the population of fathers and
sons, then the estimated probability is 446/1000 or 44.6%. But when we examine the table, we find that there
are far more tall fathers and tall sons than short fathers and short sons. We could then ask "does this estimate of
probability suggest that tall fathers have tall sons, i.e. some genetic or other relationship factor?". Overall we
can see from the totals entries that 53.5% of our sample fathers are tall and 66.1% of the sons are tall, and if
these two groups were completely independent we might reasonably expect 53.5% x 66.1% of the father-son
combinations to be tall (applying the rule of multiplication for independent probabilities). But this combination is
actually only 35.4%, so the 44.6% finding does suggest a relationship, but whether it is significant (i.e. highly
unlikely to be a chance result) requires more careful analysis using a particular statistical technique, contingency
table analysis. Cross-classifications of this kind do not require numeric classes or classes derived from numeric
values as in this example — in many instances the rows contain classes such as "Success, Failure" or "Survived,
Died" and the columns might contain "Treatment A, Treatment B, Placebo, No treatment", with the table entries
providing a count of the number of plants, patients etc. recorded in that combination of classes. In general such
multivariate classification tables are restricted to 2-way, and occasionally 3-way analysis, and rarely are the
number of classes in each dimension of the classification large if analyzed in this manner — often they are 5 or
less.
Frequency distributions can also by multi-dimensional. For example, the distribution of cases of a particular
disease around a point source of contamination might be measured in distance bands and radial sectors around
this location. This pattern might then be compared with a known bivariate frequency distribution, such as the
bivariate Normal distribution. In three dimensions one could be looking at the distribution of bacteria in cheese,
or the distribution of stars in a region of space.

Class intervals, bins and univariate classification
If sampled data are measurements of a continuous variable, x, such as the light bulb lifespans described above,
then the standard procedure in frequency chart (or histogram) production is to create a set of equal width class
intervals (or bins) and count the frequencies occurring in each interval. The values at which the bins are
separated are often referred to as cut-points. The number of intervals to be used is a matter for the researcher
to determine, depending on the problem requirements. It is often helped, in interactive software packages, by
viewing a display of the resulting histogram as different options are selected. For visualization purposes it is
desirable to limit the number of classes to between 5 or 9, as using large numbers of classes (20+) can be difficult
to display and interpret with clarity, and an odd number of intervals will ensure there is a central class. On the
other hand, with a large set of observations that exhibit considerable spread across the range, a larger number of
classes may be more helpful and will avoid the problem of having much of the real variation hidden by large class
intervals.
There are several rules of thumb for determining the ideal number of bins and/or the width for fixed-width bins
for real-valued continuous data. These include the following (n is the number of observations or data items to be

grouped, k is the number of classes, h is the bin width, s is the standardized average spread or standard deviation
of the sample data):
 max  min 
 max  min 
 , or h  

h
k





k

These options use the range and a pre-selected bin width to define the number of bins, k, or alternatively the
number of bins is specified and the range used to determine the bin width, h. Note that if the distribution has a
very long tail, e.g. a few data items that are very much larger or smaller than all the others, these formulas will
produce excessively wide bins.
The next formula is due to Scott (1979, [SCO1]) and uses the standard deviation of the dataset, s, rather than the
range to determine bin width:
h  3.5s /n1/3 




Thus for 1000 data items with a standard deviation of 25, h=9. The number of bins still remains to be chosen, and
this will be a matter of choice again, but could safely use the range calculation for k, above, in most cases.
Scott's model is built on an analysis of the optimal properties of a binning arrangement with constant bin widths
and an examination of the ideas of so-called kernel density estimation (KDE) techniques. The latter use all the
data points to create a smooth estimated probability distribution (or probability density function), which has
been shown to produce excellent results but may require a considerable amount of data processing.
As mentioned earlier, if the frequencies are to be used in computations it is necessary to define a representative
value for each interval, which is usually taken to be the mid-interval value. Thus if the bin width is h, and the
mid-interval value is xi, the interval has a range from xi-h/2 to xi+h/2. This assumption hides the within-interval
variation in values which may create some errors in computations, especially if the class width are large. The socalled Sheppard's correction, named after its author William Sheppard (1897), is an adjustment to estimates of
the variance when (Normally distributed) fixed width bins are used. Without correction the computations tend to
over-estimate the variance since they effectively treat all values in a range as the same as the mid-value.
Sheppard's correction to the variance is -h2/12, an amount that is the variance of the Uniform distribution
defined over an interval of width, h.
The table below provides details of a number of univariate classification schemes together with comments on
their use. Such schemes are essentially a generalization of fixed-width binning. Many statistical software
packages provide classification options of the types listed, although some (such as the box, Jenks and percentile
methods) are only available in a limited number of software tools.
The scheme described in the table as Natural breaks or Jenks' method is an automated procedure utilizing the
following algorithm:
Step 1: The user selects the attribute, x, to be classified and specifies the number of classes required, k
Step 2: A set of k-1 random or uniform values are generated in the range [min{x},max{x}]. These are used as
initial class boundaries or 'cut points'
Step 3: The mean values for each initial class are computed and the sum of squared deviations of class members
from the mean values is computed. The total sum of squared deviations (TSSD) is recorded

Step 4: Individual values in each class are then systematically assigned to adjacent classes by adjusting the class
boundaries to see if the TSSD can be reduced. This is an iterative process, which ends when improvement in TSSD
falls below a threshold level, i.e. when the within class variance is as small as possible and between class
variance is as large as possible. True optimization is not assured. The entire process can be optionally repeated
from Step 1 or 2 and TSSD values compared

Univariate binning/classification schemes
Classification scheme

Description/application

Unique values

Each value is treated separately — this is effectively a nominal data classification model

Manual classification

The analyst specifies the boundaries between classes/bins as a list, or specifies a lower bound
and interval or lower and upper bound plus number of intervals required. This approach is
widely used in statistical software packages

Equal interval

The attribute values are divided into n classes with each interval having the same
width=range/n

Exponential interval

Intervals are selected so that the number of observations in each successive interval increases
(or decreases) exponentially

Equal count or quantile

Intervals are selected so that the number of observations in each interval is the same. If each
interval contains 25% of the observations the result is known as a quartile classification.
Ideally the procedure should indicate the exact numbers assigned to each class, since they
will rarely be exactly equal

Percentile

In the standard version equal percentages (percentiles) are included in each class, e.g. 20% in
each class. In some implementation of percentile plots (specifically designed for exploratory
data analysis, EDA) unequal numbers are assigned to provide classes that, for example,
contain 6 intervals: <=1%, >1% to <10%, 10% to <50%, 50% to <90%, 90% to <99% and >=99%

Natural breaks/Jenks

Used within some software packages, these are forms of variance-minimization classification.
Breaks are typically uneven, and are selected to separate values where large changes in value
occur. May be significantly affected by the number of classes selected and tends to have
unusual class boundaries. Typically the method applied is due to Jenks, as described in Jenks
and Caspall (1971, [JEN1]), which in turn follows Fisher (1958, [FIS1]). Very useful for
visualization work, but unsuitable for comparisons

Standard deviation (SD)

The mean and standard deviation of the data are calculated, and values classified according
to their deviation from the mean (z-transform). The transformed values are then grouped into
classes, usually at intervals of 1.0 or 0.5 standard deviations. Note that this often results in no
central class, only classes either side of the mean and the number of classes is then even. SD
classifications in which there is a central class (defined as the mean value +/-0.5SD) with
additional classes at +/- 1SD intervals beyond this central class, are also used

Box

A variant of quartile classification designed to highlight outliers, due to Tukey (1977, Section
2C, [TUK1]). Typically six classes are defined, these being the 4 quartiles, plus two further
classifications based on outliers. These outliers are defined as being data items (if any) that
are more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range (IQR) from the median. An even more
restrictive set is defined by 3.0 times the IQR. A slightly different formulation is sometimes
used to determine these box ends or hinge values

Supervised binning and classification
Some statistical software packages differentiate between unsupervised and supervised schemes. These terms
have different meanings within different packages and application areas, which can be confusing. In broad terms
an unsupervised method utilizes the data directly, whereas a supervised method cross-refers the sample data to
https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

Statistical data

45

some other dataset that is already divided into a number of distinct classes or categories. It then uses this other
dataset to guide (or supervise) the classification process.
In SPSS, for example, supervised (or optimal) binning refers to a procedure in which the source data is divided
into bins using cut-points that seek to minimize the mix of a separate, but linked, nominal variable in each bin.
For example, the variable to be binned might be household income in $000s p.a., and the supervisor or control
variable might be the level of education achieved by the main earner of the household. The principal technique
used, known as MDLP, starts by placing every (sorted) data item (observation) into a single large bin. The bin is
then divided using cut-points, and the mix of the linked nominal variable in each bin is examined (using an
Entropy or Diversity statistic). If every entry in the bin has the same linked nominal category then the Entropy
measure will be 0, which is regarded as optimal with respect to the nominal variable. On the other hand if there
is a large mix of nominal variables represented, of roughly equal numbers, the bin will have a higher Entropy
score. The algorithm adjusts the cut points and increases the number of cut points (and hence bins) to achieve an
improvement in the total Entropy of the binning process.
In remote-sensing applications (for example, multi-spectral satellite imagery) the task is to classify individual
image pixels into groups, which may be pre-defined (e.g. land use categories, such as Forest, Grasslands,
Buildings, Water etc.) or derived from the data. Unsupervised classification in this instance refers to the use of
wholly automated procedures, such as K-means clustering, in order to group similar pixels. Supervised
classification refers to a multi-stage process, in which the dataset is compared to a reference dataset that has
already been classified, and the similarity between pixels in the dataset to be classified and the reference set is
used as a means for achieving the 'best' classification. Clearly procedures such as this, which arise in a number of
disciplines, essentially belong in the realm of multivariate data classification, which may or may not use
statistical techniques and measures as part of that process.

Scale and arrangement
In the preceding subsections we have seen that determining the ideal number and size of bins can be a quite
complicated exercise. It was noted that with too many bins only frequencies of 1 and 0 would be recorded,
whereas with very few bins, almost all the variation in the data would be hidden within the bin, or class, with
little or no variation detectable between classes. This is often the exact opposite of the ideal classification or
grouping schemes, where the aim is generally to minimize within-class variance as compared to between class
variance — making sure that classes or groupings are as homogeneous as possible. Two additional, and somewhat
unexpected factors, come into play when such groupings are made. These are known as the statistical effect and
the arrangement effect.
To understand the statistical effect (which is a scale or grouping effect) look at the regional employment
statistics shown in the Table below (after de Smith et al. (2018, [DES1]). Areas A and B both contain a total of
100,000 people who are classified as either employed or not. In area A 10% of both Europeans and Asians are
unemployed (i.e. equal proportions), and likewise in Area B we have equal proportions (this time 20%
unemployed). So we expect that combining areas A and B will give us 200,000 people, with an equal proportion of
Europeans and Asians unemployed (we would guess this to be 15%), but it is not the case — 13.6% of Europeans
and 18.3% of Asians are seen to be unemployed! The reason for this unexpected result is that in Area A there are
many more Europeans than Asians, so we are working from different total populations.

There is a further, less well known problem, which has particular importance in the process of elections and
census data collection but also has much wider implications. This is due to the way in which voting and census
areas are defined. Their shape, and the way in which they are aggregated, affects the results and can even
change which party is elected. The Grouping Data diagram below illustrates this issue for an idealized region
consisting of 9 small voting districts. The individual zone, row, column and overall total number of voters are
shown in diagram A, with a total of 1420 voters of whom roughly 56% (800) will vote for the Red party (R) and 44%
(620) for the Blue party (B). With 9 voting districts we expect roughly 5 to be won by the Reds and 4 by the Blues,
as is indeed the case in this example. However, if these zones are actually not the voting districts themselves,
but combinations of the zones are used to define the voting areas, then the results may be quite different. As
diagrams B to F show, with a voting system of “first past the post” (majority in a voting district wins the district)
then we could have a result in which every district was won by the Reds (Case C), to one in which 75% of the
districts were won by the Blues (Case F). So it is not just the process of grouping that generates confusing results,
but also the pattern of grouping. We are rarely informed of the latter problem, although it is one that is of great
interest to those responsible for defining and revising electoral and census district boundaries.

This is not just a problem confined to voting patterns and census data. For example, suppose the information
being gathered relates to the average levels of lead and zinc in the soil within each field. Samples based on
different field boundaries would show that in some arrangements the average proportion of lead in the soil
exceeded that of zinc, whilst other arrangements would show the opposite results.

The Statistical Method

The Statistical Method

Many people would regard statistical analysis as a purely technical exercise involving the application of
specialized data collection and analysis techniques, but this perception is both incorrect and misleading.
Statistical problems should be viewed within the context of a broad methodological framework, and it is the
specific nature of this framework that defines "The Statistical Method". Here we are using the terminology and
interpretation of MacKay and Oldford (2000, [MAC1]). They carefully examined the nature of statistical analysis
by discussing the problem of determining the speed of light, as conducted in the experiments of A A Michelson in
1879. Although they used research that involved a relatively complicated experiment as their example, the
conclusions they draw are much more wide-reaching. Essentially they argue that statistical analysis must involve
a broad perspective on the task under consideration, from the initial Problem definition stage (P), through
Planning and Data collection stages (P,D) through to Analysis (A) and Conclusions (C). This is similar to the
"statistical problem solving cycle" as described in the Probability & Statistics leaflet mentioned in our Suggested
Reading section and elsewhere, but widens the scope of this methodology.
The elements of this methodological framework are shown in the PPDAC table below — each is discussed in detail
in their paper. MacKay and Oldford note that very often the complexity of the analysis phase is greatly reduced if
the totality of a problem is addressed in the manner described. As can be seen, the formal analysis stage comes
well down the sequence of steps that are involved in producing good quality statistical research. Absolutely
crucial to the entire process is the initial problem definition. Only once this is thoroughly understood by all
interested parties can a plan for data collection be devised and the data obtained for subsequent analysis.

measured the speed of light in air, not in a vacuum — the difference
between the study population and the true population is known as
the study error
Response variates: Michelson measured the speed of light indirectly,
using distances, rotational speed (of a mirror), timing device (tuning
forks) and temperature
Explanatory variates: There may be a large number. Where possible
Michelson tried to fix those factors he was aware of, and measure or
vary others to check if they had an effect on his results
Sampling protocol: The detailed procedure followed for sampling the
data — in Michelson's case he made sets of measurements one hour
after sunrise and one hour before sunset, on a series of days close to
mid-summer. He made 1000 measurements, with some made by an
independent observer

In Michelson's case he summarized his data in tables and computed

for the deflection effect that air would have on his results, making a
small adjustment for temperature variations in each case.
Formal analysis was limited to analyzing possible source of error and
their maximum impact on the results, in order to obtain an estimate
of the velocity of light in a vacuum, +/- the estimated errors

Michelson presented his central finding and provided a full discussion
as to possible sources of error and why many factors could be ignored
due to the manner in which the plan was made and executed.
Despite this, the true value for the speed of light is actually outside
the limits of his estimates at the time, even though his mean result
was within 0.05% of the correct figure, hence he slightly
underestimated the size of the errors affecting his result

The PPDAC summary table suggests a relatively linear flow from problem definition through to conclusions — this
is typically not the case. It is often better to see the process as cyclical, with a series of feedback loops. A
summary of a revised PPDAC approach is shown in the diagram below. As can be seen, although the clockwise
sequence (1®5) applies as the principal flow, each stage may and often will feed back to the previous stage. In
addition, it may well be beneficial to examine the process in the reverse direction, starting with Problem
definition and then examining expectations as to the format and structure of the Conclusions (without prejudging the outcomes!). This procedure then continues, step-by-step, in an anti-clockwise manner (e®a)
determining the implications of these expectations for each stage of the process.

The Statistical Method

PPDAC as an iterative process

We now expand our discussion by examining the components this revised model in a little more detail:
Problem: Understanding and defining the problem to be studied is often a substantial part of the overall
analytical process — clarity at the start is obviously a key factor in determining whether a programme of analysis
is a success or a failure. Success here is defined in terms of outcomes (or objectives) rather than methods. And
outcomes are typically judged and evaluated by third parties — customers, supervisors, employers, politicians —
so their active involvement in problem specification and sometimes throughout the entire process is essential.
Breaking problems down into key components, and simplifying problems to focus on their essential and most
important and relevant components, are often very effective first steps. This not only helps identify many of the
issues to be addressed, likely data requirements, tools and procedures, but also can be used within the iterative
process of clarifying the customer’s requirements and expectations. Problems that involve a large number of key
components tend to be more complex and take more time than problems which involve a more limited set. This is
fairly obvious, but perhaps less obvious is the need to examine the interactions and dependencies between these
key components. The greater the number of such interactions and dependencies the more complex the problem
will be to address, and as the numbers increase complexity tends to grow exponentially. Analysis of existing
information, traditionally described as “desk research”, is an essential part of this process and far more
straightforward now with the advantage of online/Internet-based resources. Obtaining relevant information from
the client/sponsor (if any), interested third parties, information gatekeepers and any regulatory authorities,
forms a further and fundamental aspect to problem formulation and specification. Box et al. (2005, p13, [BOX1])
suggest a series of questions that should be asked, particularly in the context of conducting experiments or trials,

which we list below with minor alterations from their original. As can be seen, the questions echo many of the
issues we raise above:
· what is the objective of this investigation?
· who is responsible?
· I am going to describe your problem — is my description correct?
· do you have any past data? and if so, how were these data collected/in what order/on what days/by

whom/how?
· do you have any other data like these?
· how does the equipment work/what does it look like/can I see it?
· are there existing sampling, measurement and adjustment protocols?

Plan: Having agreed on the problem definition the next stage is to formulate an approach that has the best
possible chance of addressing the problem and achieving answers (outcomes) that meet expectations. Although
the PLAN phase is next in the sequence, the iterative nature of the PPDAC process emphasizes the need to define
and then re-visit each component. Thus whilst an outline project plan would be defined at this stage, one would
have to consider each of the subsequent stages (DATA, ANALYSIS, CONCLUSIONS) before firming up on the detail
of the plan. With projects that are more experimental in nature, drawing up the main elements of the PLAN
takes place at this stage. With projects for which pre-existing datasets and analysis tools are expected to be
used, the PLAN stage is much more an integrated part of the whole PPDAC exercise. The output of the PLAN
stage is often formulated as a detailed project plan, with allocation of tasks, resources, times, analysis of critical
path(s) and activities, and estimated costs of data, equipment, software tools, manpower, services etc.
Frequently, project plans are produced with the aid of formal tools, which may be paper-based or software
assisted. In many instances this will involve determining all the major tasks or task blocks that need to be carried
out, identifying the interconnections between these building blocks (and their sequencing), and then examining
how each task block is broken down into sub-elements. This process then translates into an initial programme of
work once estimated timings and resources are included, which can then be modified and fine-tuned as an
improved understanding of the project is developed. In some instances this will be part of the Planning process
itself, where a formal functional specification and/or pilot project forms part of the overall plan. As with other
parts of the PPDAC process, the PLAN stage is not a one-shot static component, but typically includes a process of
monitoring and re-evaluation of the plan, such that issues of timeliness, budget, resourcing and quality can be
monitored and reported in a well-defined manner. The approach adopted involves consideration of many issues,
including:
· the nature of the problem and project — is it purely investigative, or a formal research exercise; is it

essentially descriptive, including identification of structures and relationships, or more concerned with
processes, in which clearer understanding of causes and effects may be required, especially if predictive
models are to be developed and/or prescriptive measures are anticipated as an output?
· does it require commercial costings and/or cost-benefit analysis?
· are particular decision-support tools and procedures needed?
· what level of public involvement and public awareness is involved, if any?

The Statistical Method

· what particular operational needs and conditions are associated with the exercise?
· what time is available to conduct the research and are there any critical (final or intermediate) deadlines?
· what funds and other resources are available?
· is the project considered technically feasible, what assessable risk is there of failure and how is this affected

by problem complexity?
· what are the client (commercial, governmental, academic, personal) expectations?
· are there specifications, standards, quality parameters and/or procedures that must be used (for example to

comply with national guidelines)?
· how does the research relate to other studies on the same or similar problems?
· what data components are needed and how will they be obtained (existing sources, collected datasets)?
· are the data to be studied (units) to be selected from the target population, or will the sample be distinct in

some way and applied to the population subsequently (in which case, as discussed earlier, one must consider
not just sampling error but study error also)?
When deciding upon the design approach and analytical methods/tools it is often important to identify any
relevant available datasets, examine their quality, strengths and weaknesses, and carry out exploratory work on
subsets or samples in order to clarify the kind of approach that will be both practical and effective. There will
always be unknowns at this stage, but the aim should be to minimize these at the earliest opportunity, if
necessary by working through the entire process, up to and including drafting the presentation of results based on
sample, hypothetical or simulated data.
Data: In research projects that involve experiments, the data are collected within the context of well-defined
and (in general) tightly controlled circumstances, with the response and explanatory variates being clearly
included in the design of the experiment. In many other instances data is obtained from direct or indirect
observation of variates that do not form part of any controlled experiment. And in survey research, although
there will be a carefully constructed sample design, the level of direct control over variates is typically very
limited. Key datasets are also often provided by or acquired from third parties rather than being produced as part
of the research. Analysis is often of these pre-existing datasets, so understanding their quality and provenance is
extremely important. It also means that in many instances this phase of the PPDAC process involves selection of
one or more existing datasets from those available. In practice not all such datasets will have the same quality,
cost, licensing arrangements, availability, completeness, format, timeliness and detail. Compromises have to be
made in most instances, with the over-riding guideline being fitness for purpose. If the datasets available are
unsuitable for addressing the problem in a satisfactory manner, even if these are the only data that one has to
work with, then the problem should either not be tackled or must be re-specified in such a way as to ensure it is
possible to provide an acceptable process of analysis leading to worthwhile outcomes. A major issue related to
data sourcing is the question of the compatibility of different data sets: in formats and encoding; in temporal,
geographic and thematic coverage; in quality and completeness. In general datasets from different sources
and/or times will not match precisely, so resolution of mismatches can become a major task in the data phase of
any project. And as part of this process the issue of how and where to store the data arises, which again warrants
early consideration, not merely to ensure consistency and retrievability but also for convenient analysis and
reporting. Almost by definition no dataset is perfect. All may contain errors, missing values, have a finite
resolution, include distortions as a result of modeling the real world with discrete mathematical forms,

incorporate measurement errors and uncertainties, and may exhibit deliberate or designed adjustment of data
(e.g. for privacy reasons, as part of aggregation procedures).
Analysis: The Analysis phase can be seen as a multi-part exercise. It commences with the review of data
collected and the manipulation of the many inputs to produce consistent and usable data. Exploratory data
analysis (EDA), including the production of simple data summaries, tabulations and graphs is typically the first
stage of any such analysis. The impact on research of exceptions — rare events, outliers, extreme values, unusual
clusters — is extremely important. Exploratory methods, such as examining individual cases and producing boxplots, help to determine whether these observations are valid and important, or require removal from the study
set. This phase then extends into more formal study in order to identify patterns of various kinds that help the
researcher to develop new ideas and hypotheses regarding form and process. And this in turn may lead on to the
use or development of one or more models within a formal build-fit-criticize cycle. Crawley (2007, p339, [CRA1])
provides the following extremely sound advice regarding model selection (echoing a quote attributed to George
Box):
"It is as well to remember the following truths about models: all models are wrong; some models are better
than others [Box said more useful]; the correct model can never be known with certainty; and the simpler a
model the better it is"!
Finally the output of the models and analysis is examined, and where necessary the dataset and data gathering
plan is re-visited, working back up the PPDAC model chain, prior to moving on to producing the output from the
project and delivering this in the Conclusion stage. The application of a single analytical technique or software
tool is often to be avoided unless one is extremely confident of the outcome, or it is the analytical technique or
approach itself that is the subject of investigation, or this approach or toolset has been specifically approved for
use in such cases. If analysis is not limited to single approaches, and a series of outputs, visualizations,
techniques and tests all suggest a similar outcome then confidence in the findings tends to be greatly increased.
If such techniques suggest different outcomes the analyst is encouraged to explain the differences, by reexamining the design, the data and/or the analytical techniques and tools applied. Ultimately the original
problem definition may have to be reviewed.
Conclusions: The last stage of the PPDAC process is that of reaching conclusions based upon the analyses
conducted, and communicating these to others. Note that implementation of findings (e.g. actually proceeding
with building a bypass, designating an area as unfit for habitation, or implementing a vaccination programme)
does not form part of this model process, but lies beyond its confines.
“The purpose of the Conclusion stage is to report the results of the study in the language of the Problem.
Concise numerical summaries and presentation graphics [tabulations, visualizations] should be used to clarify
the discussion. Statistical jargon should be avoided. As well, the Conclusion provides an opportunity to
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Plan, Data and Analysis especially in regards to possible errors
that may have arisen” Mackay and Oldford (2000)
For many problems this summary is sufficient. For others the conclusions stage will be the start of additional
work: re-visiting the problem and iterating the entire process or parts of the process; a new project;
implementing proposals; and/or wider consultation. In Michelson's case, he was aware of several imperfections in
his research, and in fact spent the rest of his life conducting a series of further experiments in order to
progressively improve the accuracy of his estimate of the true speed of light. A full discussion of this revised
PPDAC model in the context of spatial analysis is provided in the "Chapter 3: Spatial analysis and the PPDAC
model" of de Smith et al., 2018 [DES1], which is available online.

Misuse, Misinterpretation and Bias

A great deal has been written about the misuse of statistics by pressure groups and politicians, by pollsters and
advertising campaigns, by the broadcast media (newspapers, magazines, television, and now the Internet), and
even misuse by statisticians and scientists. In some instances the misuse has been simply lack of awareness of the
kinds of problems that may be encountered, in others carelessness or lack of caution and review, whilst on
occasion this misuse is deliberate. One reason for this has been the growth of so-called evidence-based policy
making — using research results to guide and justify political, economic and social decision-making. Whilst
carefully designed, peer-reviewed and repeatable research does provide a strong foundation for decision-making,
weak research or selective presentation of results can have profoundly damaging consequences. In this section we
provide guidance on the kinds of problems that may be encountered, and comment on how some of these can be
avoided or minimized. The main categories of misuse can be summarized as:
· inadequate or unrepresentative data
· misleading visualization of results
· inadequate reasoning on the basis of results
· deliberate falsification of data

In the subsections of this topic we discuss each of these categories in turn.
Where data is obtained as the result of some form of trial, experiment or survey, careful design can help avoid
many (but not all) of the problems identified in the first category (see also Design of Experiments and Bias). This
is of particular importance in medical research, and for this reason we have included a separate subsection
focusing on this particular application area and the kinds of problems and issues that are encountered.
A simple example, which occurs only too frequently, is the presentation and interpretation of data where some
data items are omitted. A much reported example of this concerned the analysis of the failure of O-rings on the
US space shuttle in 1986. NASA staff and their contractors examined the pattern of failures of O-rings during
launches against temperature just prior to the ill-fated shuttle launch on January 28 1986. They concluded that
the data showed no apparent relationship between the number of failures and temperature, but as we now know,
the low temperature overnight did result in a failure of these components (see graph below) with catastrophic
results. What the analysts failed to consider were all those launches that had 0 failures. All the launches with no
failures occurred when the ambient temperature at the launch site was much higher, as highlighted in the
diagram (see also, the Space Shuttle dataset and example in the R library, vcd).

Misuse, Misinterpretation and Bias

In a rather different context highlighted in Jan 2010 by BBC journalist Michael Blastland (see also, our
Recommended Reading topic, [BLA1]). Reports of declining teenage pregnancy rates in Orkney off the north coast
of Scotland, were shown to be highly misleading. Blastland showed two graphs. The first appears to show a
halving of the teenage pregnancy rate between 1994 and 2006, following an intensive programme of education
and support:

However, the reports omitted data for the intervening years, and as we know from stock market and many other
types of data, rates of change depend very heavily on your start and end date. The data in this case is actually
quite cyclical, and choosing 2006 rather than, say 2007, provides a completely misleading picture, as the graph
below demonstrates.

In many instances misuse is not deliberate, but leads to biased results and conclusions that cannot be relied upon
and the consequences can be serious.
Our final example concerns the question of independent sampling. On 2nd February 2010 a UK national
newspaper, the Daily Mail, reported the story of a woman who had bought a box of 6 eggs and found that every
one contained a double-yolk. They argued that because roughly 1 egg in a thousand has a double yolk, the
chances of having a box with every one being double-yolks was one in a quintillion (1 in 1018). It was clearly a
crazy statement that assumed the occurrence of multiple yolks in a box of eggs represented a set of independent
events, and that it was therefore valid to multiply 1:1000 x 1:1000 etc. 6 times. In fact the events are in no way
independent, for a whole variety of reasons. One respondent to a discussion about this example pointed out that
most eggs are boxed in large sorting and packing warehouses, and in some cases eggs are checked against a
strong light source to see if they contain a double yolk. If they do, they are put to one side and the staff often
take these home for their own use, but if there are too many they are simply boxed up, resulting in boxes of
double-yolk eggs.

Inadequate or unrepresentative data
This is probably the most common reason for 'statistics' and statistical analysis falling short of acceptable
standards. Problems typically relate to inadequacies in sampling, i.e. in the initial design of the data collection,
selection or extraction process. This results in the sample, from which inferences about the population are made,
being biased or simply inadequate. The following list includes some of the main situations which lead to such
problems:
· datasets and sample sizes — there are many situations where the dataset or sample size analyzed is simply too

small to address the questions being posed, or is not large enough for use with the proposed statistical
technique, or is used in a misleading fashion. Smaller sample sizes are also more prone to bias from missing
data and non-responses in surveys and similar research exercises. For example, when examining the incidence
of particular diseases recorded in different census districts (or hospital catchment areas etc.) we might find
that for some diseases recorded cases were quite low in rural districts (<10), but were much higher in urban
districts (>100). Does this mean the disease is more likely to occur amongst urban dwellers? Not necessarily, as

https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

58

Misuse, Misinterpretation and Bias

there are more urban dwellers. To remove the effect of differences in the population-at-risk we might decide
to compute the incidence (or rate) of the disease per 1000 population in each district (perhaps stratified by
age and sex). Because of the relatively low population-at-risk in the rural area this might then show the risk
appears much higher in the rural areas. Is the risk really higher or is the result a reflection of the relatively
small numbers reported? Is reporting of cases for this disease the same in rural and urban areas, or is there
some differential in recording perhaps due to differences in the quality of health care available or for social
reasons? For a rare disease, a reported 25% increase year-on-year in the incidence of a particular type of
cancer in the rural district might simply be the result of an increase of a single new reported case. It is also
important to be aware that small samples tend to be much more variable in relative terms than large samples.
This can result in errors in reasoning, as we discuss later in this section (see also: Sampling and sample size).
Large sample sizes are also no guarantee of the quality or lack of bias in the data. One very early failure of a
large dataset was when the US Literary Digest’s postal poll regarding the US presidential election in 1936
received roughly 2.4 million returns. With the aim of achieving as large a sample as possible, the magazine
sought datasets that contained the names and addresses of millions of adults, these primarily comprised
vehicle registration lists and telephone directories. In total, over 10 million letters were posted. However,
despite receiving an impressive number of responses, the poll incorrectly predicted that Landon would beat
Roosevelt. Their data sources are now understood to have produced biased samples that were likely to be of a
higher socio-economic status. The rates of both automobile and telephone ownership were much lower
amongst poorer adults at the time.
· clustered sampling — this issue relates to the collection of data in a manner that is known in advance to be

biased, but is not subsequently adjusted for this bias. Examples include the deliberate decision to over-sample
minority social groups because of expected lower response rates or due to a need to focus on some
characteristic of these groups which is of particular interest — see, for example, the discussion of this issue by
Brogan (1998, [BRO1]). A second example applies where the only available data is known to be clustered (in
space and/or time) — for example, in order to obtain estimates of the levels of trace elements in groundwater
it is often only possible to take samples from existing wells and river courses, which are often spatially
clustered. If the samples taken are not subsequently weight-adjusted (or de-clustered) results may be biased
because some groups or areas are sampled more than others
· self-selection and pre-screening — this is a widespread group of problems in sampling and the subsequent

reporting of events. Surveys that invite respondents to participate rather than randomly selecting individuals
and ensuring that the resulting survey sample is truly representative are especially common. For example,
surveys that rely on opting in, such as those placed in magazines, or via the Internet, provide a set of data
from those who read the publication or view the Internet site, which is a first category of selection, and from
this set the individuals who choose to respond are then self-selecting. This group may represent those with a
particular viewpoint, those with strong views (so greater polarization of responses) or simply those who have
the time and inclination to respond. Likewise, a survey on lifestyle in the population at large that advertises
for participants in a range of lifestyle magazines, or in fitness studios and sports clubs, is likely to result in a
significantly biased sample of respondents
· exclusions — the process of research design and/or sampling may inadvertently or deliberately exclude certain

groups or datasets. An example is the use of telephone interviewing, which effectively pre-selects respondents
by telephone ownership. If the proportion of exclusions is very small (e.g. in this example, the current
proportion of people with telephones in a given country may be very high) this may not be a significant issue. A
different category of exclusion is prevalent where some data is easier to collect than others. For example,
suppose one wishes to obtain samples of bacteria in the soil of a study region. Areas which are very

inaccessible may be under-sampled or omitted altogether whilst other areas may be over-sampled. In a
different context, surveys of individuals may find that obtaining an ethnically representative sample is very
difficult, perhaps for social or language reasons, resulting in under-representation or exclusion of certain
groups — groups such as the disabled or very young or very old are often inadvertently excluded from samples
for this reason. Limitations of time and/or budget are often factors that constrain the extent and quality of
data collection and hence relevant and important data may be excluded for reasons of necessity or
expediency. Data may also be deliberately or inadvertently excluded as being probably an error or outlier. In
May 1985 the existence of the huge 'ozone hole' over the Antarctic (depleted levels of ozone at high altitudes)
was documented by research published in Nature magazine: "NASA soon discovered that the spring-time 'ozone
hole' had been covered up by a computer-program designed to discard sudden, large drops in ozone
concentrations as 'errors'. The Nimbus-7 data was re-run without the filter-program and evidence of the
Ozone-hole was seen as far back as 1976." (source: NASA)

The ozone hole over Antarctica, November 2009

Darker/Blue zone indicates ozone level <220 Dobson units; source: NASA https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov
· exclusions, continued — in an extremely thorough UK study of cancer incidence over 30 years amongst

children in the vicinity of high-voltage overhead transmission lines, the authors, Draper et al. (2005, [DRA1]),
appeared to cover every possible factor and issue. However, examining their research unstated questions
(exclusions from the research) soon become apparent: no active participation from patients or their families
was involved, and homes were not visited to measure actual levels of Electro-Magnetic (EM) radiation — this
raises the question 'is home address at birth (which the authors used) an appropriate and sufficiently accurate
measure'? (the authors did not include duration at the address, or where the children went to nursery etc.); is
vertical as well as horizontal proximity to high voltage lines of importance? (they only considered horizontal
distance); is proximity to pylons carrying insulators and junction equipment rather than just the lines an
important factor? (they omitted this issue altogether)
· pre-conceptions — researchers in scientific and social research frequently have a particular research focus,

experience and possibly current norms or paradigms of their discipline or society at large. This may result in
inadvertent use of techniques or survey questions that influence the outcome of the research. A common
https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

60

Misuse, Misinterpretation and Bias

problem is the wording of questions may lead the respondent to respond in a particular manner. Preconceptions may easily also lead to weak or incorrect reasoning from the data to conclusions
· data trawling — with large multi-variate datasets there is a high probability that statistically significant

findings can be discovered somewhere in the data — brute-force processing of datasets looking for significant
results that relate to a particular area of research interest, with or without explicit pre-conceptions, will often
succeed but may well be entirely spurious. Techniques such as data-mining, cluster-hunting and factor analysis
may all be 'misused' in this way
· temporal or spatial effects — the temporal or spatial sequence or arrangement of samples may be of critical

importance, for many reasons. Examples of temporal effects include: dependence of test results on previous
tests (e.g. in wine tasting); the temporal context of research — responses to questions on a particular topic
may be very different if that topic has had a very high profile in the news in the immediate past (e.g. personal
safety, terrorism, heart disease from too much salt in the diet, attitudes to eating Beef following the BSE/vCJD
scare etc.) — this affects both the nature and the absolute levels (assigned values) of responses; temporal
effects can also be observed in data collected as a sequence using research staff whose accuracy and attention
diminish over time (for example in repeated recording of counts in microscopy; or repeated digitization of data
points, of repeated asking of questions to interviewees). Examples of spatial effects include: location
dependence (for example social groupings in specific areas, types of building, membership of organizations
etc.); local correlation of results due to water, materials or other flows (e.g. contaminant levels in soil samples
at various locations may be related to each other due to groundwater or other localized effects). Missing data
(unsampled or lost data) in the temporal and spatial domains are also very common, especially with automated
monitoring equipment that may fail for brief or extended periods (e.g. the NASA satellite monitoring data for
high-atmosphere ozone levels from 1978 onwards was not available for much of 1995 due to technical
problems)
· over- and under-scoring — the responses individuals provide to questions or tasks often show a distinct bias.

When asked to state how confident the respondent is in the answer they have given, almost always the
confidence level is over-stated, typically by 10-20% based on the relative frequency of correct responses. In
some cultures diligence in completing surveys is taken much more seriously than in others. In one instance the
present author achieved a greater than 100% response rate to a one page questionnaire asking respondents to
list their activities on a given day — in principle impossible, but in fact many respondents photocopied the
questionnaire and completed multiple sheets, even though this was not requested. Such response patterns are
the exception — under-reporting is far more prevalent. In some instances the errors can be detected, for
example by independent measurement or using a separate survey methodology. For example, when asked to
record each telephone call made and its duration, respondents typically under-record the number of calls but
over-score the duration, often rounding up to 1- or 5-minute multiples. The product of this particular overscoring of duration and under-scoring of instances is generally close to the call hours (traffic, or Erlangs)
measured using automatic call monitoring equipment, so the effect in terms of traffic estimation tends to
cancel out in this case
· deliberate bias — by judicious selection, combination, arrangement and/or reporting of data (which may have

been extremely carefully collected) is an important and serious area of misuse. Examples include: deliberate
omission of data that does not fit the preconceptions of the researcher, or the conclusions they are seeking;
omission or adjustment of data (this may be acceptable practice in some instances, but should always be made
explicit — for example, exclusion of outliers on the grounds that they appear to be recording errors); and nonreporting of non-significant results. Examples in the temporal domain include reporting results for selected
time periods, or against selected 'base years' to suggest large changes that may not be of any significance;
https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

Statistical data

61

examples in the spatial domain include re-arranging the set of zones for which reporting is being carried out to
increase or decrease a particular level of a variable or correlation — this has a particular historical context in
politics, where the practice has become known as Gerrymandering, and in spatial analysis, where the question
has been studied in detail and is known as the MAUP problem (see further: Statistics and Statistical Analysis)

Misleading visualization of results
To be meaningful a statistical graph or chart should indicate:
· what the scales are
· whether it starts at zero or some other value, and
· how it was calculated, in particular exactly what dataset and time period it is based upon

Without all of these elements the information presented should be viewed with caution (as is clear from our
example of teenage pregnancy data in the previous section). Line graphs and histograms that simply show the
neighborhood of the top of the diagram are, in most instances, misleading. Similar issues may arise if not all
intermediate datapoints are plotted, or if data prior to or after the plotted sequence is not shown but would
place the information in a more meaningful and complete context. Likewise, charts that show the change over
time from some base date, must be viewed with caution — changing the base date may significantly alter the
values, even if the broad pattern remains unchanged. The chart below shows the daily closing price of the
NASDAQ 100 stock index from a base value of 100 in late 2002 to late 2009 (7 years data). Clearly some variation
is not visible, whilst within-day fluctuations are not reported. Non-trading days are omitted, which is entirely
valid, so the x-axis is actually not strictly a time scale but is actually an event sequence, so could easily be
numbered 1,2,3... etc. without much loss of interpretation assuming the start date was known. With a base index
of 100 the graph shows a 50% rise over 7 years, but clearly within any given window there are many movements
up and down. A 5 year window (base re-computed as 100 for 5 years data to late 2009) would suggest no change.

Misuse, Misinterpretation and Bias

Similar issues apply to all forms of visualization, indeed increasingly so as automatic creation of static and
dynamic charts, diagrams, classified maps and 3D representations become increasingly widespread. Of particular
concern is the issue of comparability. Visualizations that may be used to compare data from different sources,
datasets, times and/or locations, must be directly comparable in both design and scaling, otherwise comparison is
almost impossible. This applies to both distinct visualizations and those that show super-imposed data. For
further discussion of visualization issue, please see the Graphics and Visualization topic.

Inadequate reasoning
Drawing conclusions from research findings is always a complex process, often subject to debate. The confidence
that can be placed on conclusions will depend, in part, on the nature and quality of the data collected and
analyzed, and the quality of the reasoning applied to the interpretation of the findings. Certain types of
reasoning may appear entirely plausible but on closer examination can be seen as fundamentally flawed. The list
below provides a number of commonly encountered problems of this type.
· Correlation versus causation — it is extremely easy to assume that because there is a close (perhaps highly

significant) relationship between two variables, that one causes the other. This may occur in many ways and
can be quite subtle (obvious examples are much easier to spot). Take the following example: "Girls at single
sex schools do better than girls in mixed schools, therefore single-sex schools are better for girls". Based on
test results in the UK and in a number of other countries the first part of this statement is well documented,
but is the second part, which is a conclusion implying causality, actually correct? Without closer examination it
is difficult to know. Further research shows that other factors are at work: (i) single-sex girls schools are often
fee-paying, and wealthier families tend to have children who achieve higher academic results than less well-off
families (there may be several reasons for this observed finding); (ii) single-sex girls schools are often
selective, requiring entrance exams and/or interviews, thus filtering out groups who might under-perform or
otherwise affect the academic results achieved; (iii) fee-paying schools often have longer days and more
intensive teaching than non-fee paying schools. Put more formally, we can say that the fact that X and Y are
correlated, or vary together, tells us relatively little about the causal relationship between X and Y. So, if X
and Y vary together in some consistent manner, it might be that X causes Y, or Y causes X or that some set of
third variables, Z are involved, such that Z causes X and Z causes Y so that the correlation of X and Y is simply
due to their relationship to Z. Establishing causal relationships beyond doubt can be extremely difficult, but is
often made easier by careful experimental design, thorough analysis of related factors, and repeated,
independent, randomized trials. Recent examples of this kind of inadequate cause-effect reasoning include:
the observation that breast cancer rates are higher in countries that have a high fat content in their diet, and
then suggesting that women who eat more fat in their diet are more likely to suffer from breast cancer; or that
crime rates are higher in areas of high unemployment, and then stating that it is the unemployed who are
responsible for most crimes. The inferences drawn may be valid, and such observations can provide very useful
pointers for research, but the data only provides very tenuous support for the claims made. Sets of "guidelines"
and a number of special statistical methods have been developed over the last few decades that attempt to
provide a formal framework for developing models that seek to pinpoint causal relationships. The formal
methods include Rubin Causal Modeling (RCM), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and various forms of path
modeling. These issues are discussed further in the section below on statistics in medical research
· Misunderstanding of the nature of randomness and chance — there are a number of ways in which natural

randomness of events can be misunderstood, leading to incorrect judgments or conclusions. A simple example
is misjudging the effect of sample size. Suppose that a large hospital has 40 births per day on average, with
50% of these being boys. A smaller hospital nearby has 10 births/day, also 50% being boys on average. On some

days the proportion of boys will be higher, on others lower. Which hospital would you expect to have the most
days in a year with at least 60% of births being boys? The answer is the smaller hospital, because its records
will exhibit inherently more variability — a change from 5 boys to 6 is sufficient to raise the proportion to 60%,
whereas the larger hospital would need to have at least 4 more boys than girls born to result in a 60%+ result,
which is less likely to occur. A second example is the assumption that in a particular sequence of chance or
random events in the past is a guide to events in the future — for instance, the probability that an unbiased
coin toss will result in heads is not affected by the fact that perhaps the previous 10 times it has shown up
tails. It is probable but not certain that sooner or later the tossed coin will come down heads, but that
probability does not change from toss to toss. A similar, and perhaps more disturbing example, is the so-called
prosecutor's fallacy. In this instance a prosecutor calls an expert witness who states that a piece of evidence
(for example, an extremely rare blood group or condition) provides a link to the accused which would only
occur one time in a million. The prosecutor then claims on the basis of this opinion that there is only one
chance in a million that the accused is innocent. But we do not know that the accused is guilty (a presumption
of guilt is not a satisfactory starting point). If we assume the accused is innocent, how many other people in
the population might also demonstrate such a link? The person accused might be guilty, but additional
evidence would be needed before reaching such a conclusion. Readers interested in this particular field should
read the free RSS/ICA Statistics Guide for Lawyers (PDF). This is a highly recommended resource for both
lawyers and non-lawyers alike
· Ecological fallacy — this fallacy involves ascribing characteristics to members of a group when only the overall

group characteristics are known (special statistical techniques have been devised to address certain problems
of this type, for example as discussed in King et al., 2004, [KIN1]). A simple example is the suggestion that
most individuals in a given census area earn $50,000 p.a. based on the census return figure for the area in
question, whereas there may be no individuals at all in this area matching this description — for example 50%
might earn $25,000 p.a. and 50% $75,000 p.a., or many such combinations — from the aggregated data alone is
is simply not possible to know. The problem of statistical grouping of data, described in the previous section
(Statistics and Statistical Analysis, unemployment statistics example) illustrates some of the difficulties
encountered when data is aggregated
· Atomistic fallacy — this fallacy involves ascribing characteristics to members of a group based on a potentially

unrepresentative sample of members. As such it can be regarded as a central issue in statistical research, often
related to sampling that is far too small or unrepresentative to enable such conclusions to be reached
· Misinterpretation of visualizations — there is endless scope for misinterpretation and there are many books on

what makes for good and bad visualizations. The work of Edward Tufte (1983, [TUF1]) is amongst the best at
providing guidance on what makes for good visualization. The emphasis should always be on clarity of
communication, often achieved through simplicity in design and labeling. However, the apparently simple and
clear chart can easily provide scope for confused reporting. For example, the data for the chart below was
cited in the Summer 2007 issue of the USA City Journal in an article authored by David Gratzer M.D., in which
he stated that says the U.S. prostate cancer survival rate is 81.2 percent and the U.K. survival rate is 44.3
percent. This apparently authoritative commentary was then picked up and used by leading US politicians.
There are several problems with this interpretation of the graph. First, the data are from 7 years beforehand.
Second, reported incidence simply reflects diagnosis rates, which in turn is related to the level of screening for
the condition, which at the time was much more common in the USA than the UK. And finally, it is incorrect to
deduce survival rates from the raw data on diagnosis and mortality rates. Survival rates require data that
tracks the date of diagnosis to the lifespan of the individual. In broad terms the five-year relative survival rate

Deliberate falsification of data
There are occasions when data is deliberately falsified. This maybe as a result of a rogue individual scientist or
group, commercial enterprise and even government agencies. The case of Prof Hwang Woo Suk who published
fraudulent results on human cloning from stem cells in 2006 is one of the most famous (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Woo-suk), but there is little doubt that deliberate or semi-deliberate
falsification of data is more common than many realize. Deliberate omission of results that show no significant
results or results that do not support a particular hypothesis can be regarded as a form of deliberate falsification
and is a well-established problem in academic and medical research. Recent high-profile "fake news" cases
highlight how modern media and lack of independent scrutiny can result in such issues becoming widely
circulated.

Sampling and sample size

Sampling and sample size

Sampling is central to the discipline of statistics. Typically samples are made in order to obtain a picture of the
population as a whole without the need to make observations on every member of that population. This saves
time, cost and may be the only feasible approach, perhaps because the population is infinite or very large or is
dynamic, so sampling provides a snapshot at a particular moment in time. Ideally we wish to make a sample that
provides an extremely good representation of the population under study, whilst at the same time involving as
few observations as possible. These two objectives are clearly related, since a perfect representation is only
possible if the entire population is measured or if the population is completely uniform. This latter point
highlights the fact that larger and more carefully structured samples may be required to obtain an estimate of a
given quality if the population is highly variable. The difference between the measured value for an attribute in
a sample from the 'true value' in the population is termed sampling error.
Typically a set of n independent samples are taken based on some form of random selection from the target
population, as far as it is possible to define the latter. Randomness in the selection process seeks to help
eliminate bias, whilst independence of samples also helps to ensure that bias due to samples being associated
with each other in some way is minimized. For example, a sample of leaves from banana trees would seek to take
one sample from each of a large number of banana trees that were relatively well separated spatially. It would
be inappropriate to take 10 different samples from one tree (the samples would not be independent as they all
came from the same tree) and likewise, trees in close proximity may exhibit similarities due to localized effects
(e.g. soil, cultivation practice, disease spread etc.) which may result in samples not being independent. Similar
considerations apply to samples taken from animals or humans, or from soils and rocks, and in some instances,
samples take over a period of time where time dependencies exist. In cases where space- and/or timedependencies are thought to exist, tests for autocorrelation should be carried out and, if necessary, sample
design and modeling must explicitly take account of the lack of independence between observations. The
procedure adopted for any particular sampling exercise is known as the sampling protocol, and should always be
carefully planned and designed.

Target Population
The first step in this process is to define the population of interest, from which samples are to be taken. The
population may be finite or infinite, and may be very clearly defined (even if difficult to enumerate) — for
example, "all adults over the age of 18 living in a given city", or may be less well defined — for example
"particulates in the air over London", or "all measurements of outcomes from a particular industrial process".
Ensuring the nature of the population to be studied is well understood is an important step in the initial design of
any sampling scheme.

Study population
The study population is the collection of units that could possibly be measured (known as the sampling frame in
survey work). In some instances samples are made on a population that can conveniently be studied (for example,
sampling in a laboratory or a particular location) rather than sampling the population itself, with the results being
applied to the real population of interest. This results in so-called study error, which again one seeks to
minimize. In the example cited in The Statistical Method section, Michelson measured the speed of light in air on
the Earth's surface, not the speed of light in a vacuum, so the study error in this case consisted of the difference

between these two environments. In many studies the research is carried out at a particular time and location,
and the possible effects of temporal and spatial variation are excluded or deemed to have no substantive bearing
on the results. However, all research does take place in space and time, so there is always some study error
related to these factors. For example, after Michelson had completed his research, one criticism of it was that it
was carried out during a brief period of the year, which did not allow for the possibility that the findings would
have been different had the research been conducted 3 or 6 months later (reflecting the different position of the
Earth relative to the Sun). It is often helpful to ensure that the study population is as tightly defined as possible,
thereby ensuring that sampling is only from those individuals or objects that are of direct interest and helping to
restrict variation in measured attributes.

Sampling protocol
This is the detailed procedure followed for sampling the data from the study population. In many instances the
sampling protocol makes use of some level of randomization in order to avoid the risk of bias. The time, location
and possible selection from subgroups of the study population form key elements of the sampling protocol.
Controlled experiments typically involve use of a formal design that seeks to separate explanatory variables into
distinct groups, which are then systematically or randomly sampled. In many instances random numbers are
required in order to select entities, locations or times to be sampled, and typically these are computer-generated
from a uniform distribution over the range [0,1]. Random numbers may also be drawn from other distributions,
either using built-in software functions (e.g. the Excel Data Analysis tools Random Number generator facility, or
SPSS functions of the form RV.DIST which returns a random value from a distribution DIST with specified
parameters), or by using Uniform random numbers in conjunction with the cumulative distribution of interest.
In many instances a sample is required from an empirical distribution or a known (theoretical) distribution with
pre-defined parameters. Typically this involves taking a random sample from the distribution selected or from a
subset (e.g. a range) within this distribution. Many software packages provide facilities for generating such
random samples, which may then be used to compare with observed datasets or as a frame for sampling (see
further, Sampling from a known distribution).
When a large number of records have been obtained and stored in a database, samples from the dataset may be
extracted for analysis rather than analyzing the full dataset (which might consist of thousands or millions of
records). Typically samples of a pre-specified size are selected at random from the stored recordset, with checks
made to ensure that key parameters do not vary too greatly from the population values (i.e. the sample is
representative, not biased). Samples may be taken with or without replacement (without replacement is the
norm) and may be stratified if necessary, depending on the manner in which the data is stored and grouped. Most
statistical software packages provide a range of procedures for record selection. These vary from systematic to
simple random, stratified random where selection probabilities are proportional to stratum size (PPS), and many
variants on these. The table below lists the options provided for SPSS — other packages provide similar facilities.
The documentation for SPSS, SAS/STAT and other packages provide exact details of how the variants (e.g. PPS
Brewer vs PPS Murthy - see further below) are calculated. It is important to note that most standard statistical
formulas assume that records are drawn from an infinite population by simple random sampling without
replacement (WOR). If this is not the case the analytical tools applied must be adjusted to take the data
selection procedure adopted into account. Again, statistical software that facilitates such non-random selection
will also include facilities for computing core statistical measures and simple models adjusted for the sampling
approach adopted.

Use WR estimation for analysis

By default, an estimation method is specified in the plan file that is consistent with
the selected sampling method. This allows you to use with-replacement (WR)
estimation even if the sampling method implies WOR estimation. This option is
available only in stage 1

The above concepts apply, in somewhat modified form, to problems in higher dimensions. In particular, in two
dimensions (spatial data selection) a number of special procedures may be required to ensure that samples are
both randomly selected and yet are also representative (see further, de Smith et al., 2018, section 5.1.2 [DES1]).
As a simple illustration of the kind of approaches that can be adopted, the diagram below shows four methods for
point sampling within a 100x100 unit study region. One interesting and important feature of this example is that
approach B, which is simple random sampling, results in apparent spatial clustering of samples, whilst substantial
areas are left unsampled. Sampling approach C is one means of trying to limit this affect. For more details see
the reference cited.

Sampling and sample size

Sample size
There are many factors that affect the choice of sample size. In public opinion surveys it is very common to hear
that the sample taken was of around 1000-1500 people. This figure is obtained from a relatively simplistic
calculation, based on achieving an approximately 95% confidence level in the results with estimation of a
proportion, p, within a range of roughly +/-3% (see also, our discussion on confidence intervals). The figure of
1000-1500 arises from these two requirements — using a Binomial distribution the standard error (SE) of the
proportion, p, is Ö(pq/n). Note that the term Ö(pq) is maximized for any given n when p=q=0.5, so this
assumption provides an upper bound of 1/2 on Ö(pq) and thereby on the range of expected variation in our
estimate. Now from the Normal distribution, which is the limit of the Binomial for large n (and a reasonably rapid
approximation if p and q are similar in size), we know that 95% of the distribution is included within roughly +/- 2
standard deviations. Thus the sample size needed to ensure an error in an estimate of x=5% is obtained from the
formula for 2SEs, i.e. 1/Ön. This gives the result n=1/x2 so for x=5%, x=0.05 we have n=400, or for 3% we have
just over 1100. For a 1% range at 95%+ confidence a sample size of 10,000 would be required, so the choice of
1000-1500 is a compromise between the quality of estimation and the cost and time involved in undertaking the
survey.
For some problems wider bands are acceptable on the estimated proportion or mean, thus for a value within +/20% a sample of only 25 is required — if this was an estimate of the concentration of zinc in the soil in parts per
million (ppm), an estimate of 100ppm with a range of 80-120ppm may be perfectly acceptable. This method of
computing sample size is, of course, simply a rule of thumb that has been found to work in many situations of this
particular type. Put more formally, we are estimating the probability, a, that the estimated proportion will not
differ from the population proportion, p, by more than some amount x:
Pr | p  pˆ | x   

If we denote by za the Normal distribution probability value for a confidence interval determined by a (e.g. with
a=0.025, two-tailed test, 5% in total, za=1.96) then this (rather simplified) formula for sample size n becomes:

n  z2 pq x 2

Sample size selection is related to several factors, including: (i) cost, time and risk; (ii) the type of problem being
addressed (and the techniques used to address the problem); and (iii) the variability of the data being sampled. If
one has prior knowledge of the data variability, or can make an informed estimate of this (for example based on
prior research and/or test samples), then the determination of sample size becomes more straightforward.
Clearly greater variability in the data will mean that the standard error (SE) is intrinsically larger, which in turn
requires a bigger sample size for a given level of precision in the parameter(s) to be estimated. Furthermore, if
the population is known to vary in some kind of structured (or stratified) manner, for example spatially or
temporally, then it makes sense to sample less frequently in the less variable phases or zones and more
frequently in those strata of the study population that are more variable. Thus a given overall sample size, n,
might represent the sum of a set of stratified samples {ni}, where each ni is separately determined from the
estimated variance, si, in zone or time slot i. There is an optimal method of determining the component samples
given n, assuming that estimates of the variance in each zone, si, are available together with some measure of
the proportions, wi, of the overall population represented by each of the separate zones or strata. With

71

countable items (e.g. census data) these proportions can be obtained as the count in zone i divided by the total
for all zones; other approaches might be to use areas or length of sampled time slots to determine the
proportions. The basic allocation rule is then:
k

ni  n wi si 



k

wi si  , where

i 1

 wi  1
i 1

Note that this allocation simply determines how a given sample size (perhaps obtained with reference to some
cost or time constraint) may be allocated amongst the selected strata.
Bartlett et al. (2001, [BAR1]) provide a general discussion of sample size determination for educational and social
research, drawing on the earlier work of Cochran (1977, [COC1]). Their guidance draws on the experience of
many researchers conducting questionnaire surveys and similar social research programmes. The formulas
described are based on those discussed above, but take into account issues such as: finite population size;
determination of the estimated variance; dealing with multiple measured variables of various types; and finally,
dealing with non-response. Cochran recommends, for example, that if the sample size, n, exceeds 5% of the
population size, P, then the sample size value should be adjusted by a factor n/(1+n/P). Assuming an initial
sample size estimate of 400 and a population of 4000, this would adjust the sample size down to 364. If the
expected response rate is 60% the sample size is then increased to approximately 600.
A number of statistical tests, such as z-tests and t-tests, yield results that are dependent on the sample size,
through the standard error. The sections that describe these tests also provide guidance on how to compute the
sample size in order to meet requirements on the levels of Type I and Type II errors that are acceptable. Special
graphs, known as Operating Characteristic curves, provide plots of the relationship between sample size and the
two main types of error (see Ferris et. al., 1946, [FER1], for a number of such charts covering c2, F, Normal or ztests and t-tests).
In the medical field a range of sample size guidance documents, tables, software tools and formulas are
available, many of which are effectively variants on the same general model (see Altman [ALT1], Chow, Shao and
Wang [CHO1], Jones et al [JON1], Carley et al.[CAR1], Dupont and Plummer [DUP1], Whitley and Ball [WHI1], and
Machin et al.[MAC1]). Typically sample size estimation in these publications is based on the relationship between
three elements, two involving risk assessments and one involving the size of the effect one is seeking to discover
(small effects require larger samples in order to detect them reliably): (a) the risk of a false positive (a level,
usually taken as 5% or 0.05); (b) the risk of a false negative (b level, usually taken as 20% or 0.20; or using the
notion of power=1-b, so 80%); and (c) the size of the effect. The last item can be difficult to determine, but is
typically of the form: E=(target difference)/(estimated standard deviation). For example, if a study is trying to
detect a difference of size 14 units between a measurement on two equal sized groups (e.g. the blood pressure in
mmHg treated using different therapies, with measurements taken 6 hours after therapy commenced) and the
estimated standard deviation was 18mmHg, then the standardized effect value would be 14/18=0.78. The chart
below, redrawn from Altman [ALT1], enables the required sample size to be read from the central section by
drawing a straight line between locations on the left and right hand axes. The left hand axis shows a measure of
the size of effect one is trying to detect (in standardized units) whilst the axis on the right shows the power of
the test (as noted above power=1-the risk of a Type II error or false negative). The third element, the risk of a
Type I error or false positive is determined by the significance level in the central section.

Sampling and sample size

Altman's Nomogram for computing sample size or power (two equal sized groups)

So if an experiment is to be defined that seeks to be able to identify a standardized effect of size 1.0 with a
power of 80% and a risk of a Type I error of 5% we draw the red line (lowest on the nomogram)and choose an
overall sample size of around 32, i.e. a target of 16 participants in each of two groups. If the power is increased
(e.g. to 90%) and/or the effect size reduced (e.g. to 0.6) the required sample size increases to around 60 per
group (120 total — blue line, upper line). For the blood pressure example cited earlier, a total sample size of 52
is required, as shown by the green (middle) line (26x2, based on an 80% power level). Note that this analysis can
also identify trials that are inadequately powered, for example a trial that seeks to identify a relatively small
effect with a sample size that is too small will equate to one whose power is low. Essentially these results are

based on the use of the (non-central) t-distribution in a t-test for the difference of two means where the
population standard deviation is not known (see further, NIST and Beyer, Table IV.4 [BEY1] — note that these
sources cite the sample size required for a single group).
Some have argued that this model is over-cautious and results in recommended sample sizes that are larger than
are clinically necessary (with important ethical and practical implications), focusing instead on estimation based
on clinical effect (e.g. benefits, harm). A related, alternative approach to sample-size determination, is to
explicitly include measures of cost, in particular attempting to place a cost on each Type of error. The total cost
is then the risk of a Type I error times the cost of this error plus the risk of a Type II error times the cost of this
error plus the cost of the experiment or research exercise. This approach makes a great deal of sense, but
allocating costs in advance to the different types of error can be very difficult. If it is possible to produce such
costs the impact of increasing sample size can be examined. In broad terms as sample size increases the Type I
and Type II errors reduce so the costs associated with these risks will decrease, but the cost of the experiment
will increase and may be infeasible for practical or ethical reasons. Incrementally increasing the sample size may
achieve a result whereby total costs are minimized and this value can then be used for the research exercise.

Rare events
Particular issues arises in connection with rare events, for example when conducting trials of a vaccine that
protects against a relatively rare disease, or when investigating suspected links between particular cancers and
point sources of environmental pollution. In the former case, it may be necessary to carry out a trial involving
very large numbers of individuals in order to identify a statistically significant effect. This was the case with early
trials of the Salk Polio vaccine in the USA, in 1954, following Polio epidemics in 1952 and 1953. The estimated
normal rate of infection at the time was around 50 per 100,000 population, but this still represented a large
number of people (typically children). To obtain a target of approximately 100 confirmed cases of polio based on
the normal incidence this would require a study group of 200,000 children. In the event, a randomized control
trial (RCT) involving two groups of approximately 200,000 children using a double-blind assignment of subjects
was undertaken — one group being given the Salk vaccine and the other a saline placebo. An extract of the core
results are shown below — the success of the RCT led to the rapid roll-out of the Salk vaccine and then other,
preferred vaccines, in the immediate aftermath, ultimately leading to the virtual eradication of Polio worldwide
today. However, many aspects of the overall trial process were deeply flawed, with a large part of the trial
(which was not in RCT form) described by Brownlee (1955, [BRO1]) as "futile" and "worthless".

A simple form of analysis of this kind of data is to compute the effectiveness of the treatment by comparing the
rates of infection per 100,000 in the vaccinated (r1) and placebo (r2) groups. The effectiveness measure is then
E=100(1-r1/r2)% giving a result of E=72% in this case. Data of this kind can be analyzed in a number of different
ways. A simple approach is to consider the probability of observing x=33 or fewer paralytic cases of polio amongst

Sampling and sample size

those who were vaccinated as against 115 in the placebo group, both groups having been drawn from large equal
sized populations. Using the null hypothesis that from a total of n=148 severe cases one would expect each group
to have roughly half the total, hence p0=0.5, we can use a simple z-transform of Binomial form:
z

which is a very large (negative) value, hence extremely unlikely to have arisen by chance. By comparison, the
number of non-paralytic cases were quite similar and very likely to have arisen by chance. This is the approach
adopted by Francis and Korns [FRA2, Administrative content section, pp62-63].

Data preparation and cleaning

Careful data preparation is an essential part of statistical analysis. This step assumes the data have been
collected, coded and recorded, and now reside in some form of data store. This will often be in the form of a
simple table (sometimes referred to as a data matrix) or SQL-compatible database. Depending on how the data
were coded and stored, variables may or may not have suitable descriptions, coding or data types assigned, and if
not, this is one of the first tasks to carry out. At this stage it will become apparent if any data items are
incompatible with the data type assignments, for example text coded in numeric fields, or missing data that
requires entry of a suitable 'missing data' code. Data provided from third parties, whether governmental or
commercial, should include a metadata document that describes all aspects of the data in a standardized and
thorough manner [UNI1].
Analysis of the dataset for duplicates is often the next step to undertake. There may be many reasons for
duplicates existing in datasets, these include: genuine duplicates on one or more variables; data entry errors;
multiple returns for the same case; duplicates on a subset of variables (as opposed to entirely duplicate records);
and duplicates representing deliberate coding to the same reference. Depending on the nature and validity of the
duplicates, decisions have to made on how they are to be treated. In some instances data will need to be deduplicated, in others data will be retained unchanged, whilst in some instances additional data will be added to
records to ensure the duplicates are separately identifiable. When analyzing duplicates using Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) tools, duplicates may be hidden — for example, point maps of crime incidents frequently underrepresent the concentration of crimes in certain locations as these are often recorded as co-located.
Identification of duplicates may, of itself, be a form of EDA, identifying genuine co-incident results, or perhaps
highlighting data coding protocols (such as assigning particular disease incidence to doctors surgeries or hospitals
rather than the home address of the individual).
Zero and null (missing data) occurrences form a special group of duplicates that apply to one or more variables
being studied. In many datasets the number of zeros recorded may be very large and their inclusion may totally
distort analysis of the variables in question. Software tools may provide the option to mask out (i.e. hide) zeros
from subsequent analysis. For example, a data collection device might record a value of an environmental
variable, such as wind speed and direction, every 10 minutes. For perhaps 50% of all data items logged the speed
might be below the threshold for measurement with the result that directional information also has no real
meaning. Analysis of the dataset might choose to exclude the zero values from some EDA visualizations and
statistical analyses, as these would overwhelm the results — this is not to say that such data be ignored, but that
it should be separated for some parts of the analysis.
EDA methods will also tend to highlight exceptional data values, anomalies and outliers (specific measurements
or entire cases) that require separate examination and/or removal from subsequent analysis. Note that this
analysis is taking place on the source data, not post-processed information, although the measurement and
recording process itself may have effectively pre-determined some of the possible characteristics of the source
data (e.g. the coding applied, the resolution of measurement and recording equipment, any systematic data
filtering applied during measurement or recording etc.).
In the case of outliers, there are several options of how they should be dealt with, and these will depend on the
particular problem and form of analysis being considered. If the outlier is known to be an error (e.g. a miscoding, by placing a decimal point in the wrong place) it can be corrected or removed. It may be an event of
great interest, in which case it warrants separate examination and analysis — this again may result in the item(s)

Data preparation and cleaning

being removed from the rest of the dataset. It can also be altered in a systematic manner, for example: changing
the value to be 3 standard deviations from the mean; "Winsorizing" the value, whereby it is amended up or down
to the adjacent value in a sorted series; or effectively excluded by computing statistics based on forms of
trimmed measures, such as the trimmed mean.
Once a dataset has undergone preliminary inspection and cleaning, further amendments may be made in order to
support subsequent analyses and the use of specific statistical models. It may be desirable for such amendments
to result in the creation of a new data table or data layer, thereby ensuring that the source data remains
untouched and available for re-inspection and analysis. In some instances (very large datasets) it is preferable to
extract a representative sample of records and then apply modifications to this extracted set. Data in this new or
modified layer may be subject to re-coding, grouping into new groups or classes, and/or apply some form of data
transformation (for example applying a transformation to a continuous variable to improve the fit to the Normal
distribution). A very large number of transformations are possible, many of these being supported in standard
statistical analysis packages. For certain data types (such as temporal and spatial datasets) a specialized set of
transformations are used, which reflect the serial and neighborhood aspects of such data. For example, with
temporal data, various forms of temporal averaging, seasonal adjustments and filtering may be applied, whilst in
spatial analysis such changes may be based on local, focal or zonal computations (see further, de Smith et al.,
2018, [DES1]).

Missing data and data errors

Missing data is a wide-ranging term for the absence of expected data from a recorded sample, which may occur
for many reasons and in many ways. In can be a small, easily managed problem, or a larger problem that raises
questions about the usability of the dataset. Missing data can involve all relevant data for a record or set of
records, or it could be missing values from a set of measurements relating to individual records (incomplete
records). Each different situation requires separate consideration, both as to the seriousness of the problem, and
to the means by which such difficulties are to be addressed. In the following paragraphs we discuss some
examples of the key issues and approaches to resolving them. We then look in more detail at some of the
techniques and tools provided within statistical software packages that are designed to assist in these situations.
In sample surveys the most common reasons are non-response, partial responses (only some questions answered)
and spoiled responses. Surveys may be structured to ensure sample sizes are increased to a level at which the
target response is achieved taking into account non-response and unusable responses, although this can be
difficult when the survey involves quotas (e.g. the study must include responses from 50 women between the
ages of 40 and 60, 50 between 60 and 80, and so forth). In general it is very difficult to avoid the problem that
sample surveys or trials will yield incomplete response data, particularly where there are many questions or
variables being examined. Such problems can lead to biased results and need to be addressed as early as possible
in the overall data collection design and implementation phase of a project. Missing data may also be
encountered when an experiment or trial is undertaken and unforeseen circumstances make some of the data
unusable or impossible to obtain. For example, the present author conducted a controlled trial of three different
types of multi-lingual keyboard in the European Commission headquarters in Brussels. A total of 96 staff were
recruited (48 for week 1, 48 for week 2) to undertake computer-controlled typing tests in a variety of real and
synthetic languages. All test sessions were completed with no data losses until one morning the building was
picketed and attacked by French farmers protesting against proposed changes to the Common Agricultural Policy.
They entered the building and were only removed after tear gas was used, which in turn shut down the lower
levels of the building and our morning's data session was lost! Fortunately the exercise included enough
replicates, including a complete replicate of the entire experiment in week 2, so analysis of the results was only
marginally affected (see Evans, 1988 [EVA1]). In trials of medical procedures one or more of those involved in the
trial may be unable to complete the trial due to illness or other, unrelated factors, or maybe one sample
becomes contaminated or is not of the correct strength, so the data has to be discarded. This may be all the data
relating to one or more participants in the trial, but more commonly relates to one or data items relating to a
case — for example, a missing test result. Datasets that rely on remote-sensing equipment frequently
demonstrate missing data, when equipment fails or has to be taken out of use temporarily for servicing or other
reasons.
For certain experiments and analyses, such as some randomized block designs, loss of even a single data item is
important because it upsets the balanced nature of the design and its subsequent analysis. Where observations
are unavailable for a single unit this may be partially overcome by estimating or imputing the missing data from
the remaining information, thereby turning the unbalanced design back to a balanced form. For example, in a
randomized block design (see further, Cox, 1958 [COX1]) with k blocks and t treatments a simple estimate for a
single missing value is given by (kB-tT-G)/(k-1)(t-1) where B is the total of all remaining observations in the block
containing the missing observation, T is the total of observations on the missing treatment, and G is the grand
total. This provides a simple form of averaging for a single missing value — least squares techniques or simple
iterative estimation can be used to extend the concept to more than one missing value. Analysis then continues

Missing data and data errors

as if the estimated value or values were genuine, but with residual degrees of freedom reduced by 1 for each
missing value and a correction for bias applied to the total sums of squares in the Analysis of Variance
computation. Likewise, in time series analysis, complete time series are almost always required, making analysis
of incomplete temporal datasets very problematic. Where such data is missing at the start or end of a series, it
may be sufficient to simply ignore this problem and analyze the data that is available, assuming that it can be
regarded as representative of the entire period. However, if embedded values (i.e. within the series) are missing
some form of estimation is often the only option.
Another common reason for missing data is incorrect data recording, coding or subsequent processing. The precise
reason for such errors and the scale of the problem are important to determine. Incorrect data coding by
researchers and data preparation staff can often be checked through systematic verification, for example by
taking a sample of each block of survey returns and having these independently recoded and compared with the
original coding. Incorrect interpretation of survey questions, or incorrect recording of data by surveyed
individuals, needs to be identified through inspection and validation techniques, thereby identifying the scale
and nature of any problems, and implementing changes or corrections to the data gathering and/or subsequent
processing of the data. The widely publicized issue of data quality associated with the Climate Science Unit (CSU)
at East Anglia University in the UK (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy
and the IPCC dataset site: https://www.ipcc-data.org/ ) provides a vivid insight into some of the issues
associated with collating and cleaning datasets from multiple sources on a range of variables over a prolonged
period of time.
Minor errors and occasional items of missing data can often be handled programmatically, but in some cases such
approaches are not sufficient and the data and project will have to be reviewed in the light of the data
limitations. Many software packages include facilities to handle problems with data completeness. The most
common arrangement is for data to be coded to identify missing values, for example using a distinct entry such as
a blank " ", * or -999 to indicate a missing value, depending on the data type and range being recorded. When an
entry of this kind is encountered, the software package will apply one or more rules in order to determine what
action to take. For example, in computing basic statistics for quantitative datasets it may simply ignore missing
values (as opposed to deleting records with missing values) and carry out the computation on the available
subset, with a reduced count of items. This raises the question as to whether such estimates are biased.
It is not merely the scale of missing items that must be considered, but also whether there is any pattern to the
missing data. If the missing values occur completely at random (MCAR) and the proportion of missing values is not
large (<5%) then statistics such as mean values, variances, correlations etc. can be produced ignoring these
missing values and the results will tend to be unbiased. However, if the missing values are not randomly
distributed throughout the data, bias will be apparent. It is possible that the non-randomness of missing values is
partial, in the sense that within groups the missing values occur randomly but between groups there are
substantial differences. This might be observed in cases where one group in more likely to respond to a question
or to perform a task than another group. If the data show missing at random (MAR) data within groups but do not
conform to the MCAR requirement, it is still possible to produced unbiased statistics within these groups. It may
also be possible/acceptable to fill in missing values with estimated values that are derived from the remaining
data in the entire study or subsets of the study — this applies principally to quantitative data in univariate and
multivariate data sets, and to temporal and spatial datasets.
In order to determine whether MCAR, MAR or neither apply, the dataset can be partitioned and subject to various
forms of simple pattern analysis and statistical comparisons. For example, all records could be divided into those
with and without a data value on a given variable, and a comparison statistic (such as Little's chi-squared test,
https://www.statsref.com

Statistical data

79

[LIT1, LIT2]) computed to try and detect any significant differences between the two subsets. Having identified
the scale and nature of the missing data problem, the question then arises as to what action to take. If the
sample size is large enough and the proportion of records with missing data is small, it may be acceptable to
either ignore the missing values (especially if the MCAR or MAR tests indicate that this is very safe to do), or to
delete/ignore entire records with missing values (generally an unsafe practice, as this tends to introduce
additional bias), or to impute the missing data (see further, below) from the remaining records. In this latter case
missing data are essentially 'invented' by reference to other data in the sample. Typically results are then
reported with and without the imputed data, with a clear explanation of the impact of imputation on the
results.
There are many techniques for such imputation, notably maximum likelihood and a variety of regression methods.
Pure multiple regression methods tend to underestimate the true variance of the imputed data values, so some
form of variance inflation may be added to overcome this limitation. So-called multiple imputation (MI) methods
are now favored by some researchers since these appear to provide more representative and robust results (see
further, Pickles, 2005, [PIC1]). MI methods involve some form a conditional simulation, producing several
imputations (typically 5-10) and then using the mean of the results as the estimates for the missing values.
Alternatively the entire analytical procedure can be carried out on each of the versions of the dataset, and the
results from each analysis averaged or compared. Typically such methods will compute the mean and variance of
the variable across records for which complete data is available and then sample random values from the Normal
distribution matching these parameters to obtain sample values for the missing item. Some packages, such as
SAS/STAT, perform MI using samples obtained via MCMC methods (essentially this involves using the remaining
data as a model distribution for the missing data and randomly sampling from this model distribution). For
categorical data samples are taken from a Multinomial distribution. Another approach, which is sometimes usable
with categorical data, is to create a new category that contains those records that include missing data.
Similar concepts have been applied in temporal and spatial analysis, both as a form of missing data analysis and
as a form of prediction or estimation for unsampled times and locations. For example, the use of conditional
simulation is now a preferred form of prediction in geospatial engineering applications, such as oil and mineral
prospecting. If there are very few missing data points in dense temporal or spatial datasets it is usual for these to
be estimated using deterministic procedures, using linear, bi-linear or spline interpolation from their immediate
or near-neighboring data items, or using simple mean or median values in the local neighborhood. The quality of
imputed results can be evaluated by comparison with the entire dataset (e.g. convergence of parameters), by
internal consistency checks (e.g. jackknifing and bootstrapping techniques) and/or by reference to external
datasets and samples (e.g. so-called 'ground truth' comparisons).

Handling missing values — techniques and tools
This section provides a brief summary of the main approaches for handling missing values. In most instances these
are procedures offered within software packages, but it remains the responsibility of the researcher to select the
method used and to document and justify such selection when reporting the results of analysis. In many cases
estimating missing values will apply to real-valued measurements, but some procedures may apply to binary or
categorical data.

Ignoring entire records
This is the most commonly available approach for handling missing data. As noted above, this is only acceptable if
the number of records is relatively large, the number of records with missing data is relatively small (<5%), and
https://www.statsref.com

(c) 2018-2024

80

Missing data and data errors

the missing records can be shown to occur completely at random (MCAR) or are missing at random (MAR) within
well-defined subsets of the data. In general this approach cannot be used in small sample balanced trials nor for
time series.

Setting missing values to fixed value
Many packages allow missing values to be replaced with a fixed value (e.g. 0) or a user-provided value for each
instance. The problems of adopting these approaches are obvious.

Single estimation procedures
A very common approach to missing values is to use some form of estimation based on the characteristics of the
data that has been successfully collected. For example, the SPSS Transform operation, Missing Values option,
offers the following options for estimating such values: (i) use of the mean or median value of nearby points (by
which it means neighboring records, with the number of such records used selectable by the researcher); (ii) use
of the overall series mean, i.e. the mean based on all records; (iii) linear interpolation, which applies to data in
series and uses the two adjacent non-missing values, to fill in the gap or gaps; (iv) linear regression, which is
similar to linear interpolation but use a larger number of neighboring points and calculates a best fit line through
these as its estimator for intermediate missing values. Other software packages may provide additional options —
for example, a variety of model-based interpolation options are available in the SAS/ETS (Economic and Time
Series) software. Similar procedures are provided in some other packages, but often it remains the researcher's
responsibility to provide or compute estimates for missing values as a part of the data cleaning and preparation
stage.

Multiple imputation (MI)
Multiple imputation (MI) methods vary depending on the type of data that is missing and the software tools used
to estimate (impute) the missing values. In this subsection we describe the approaches adopted by the SAS/STAT
and SPSS software, which are largely based on the published work of Rubin (1976, 1987, 1996 [RUB1],[RUB2],
[RUB3]).
Essentially there are 3 stages to MI:
· the missing data are filled in m times to create m complete datasets (m is typically 5)
· the m complete datasets are analyzed separately, in the usual manner
· the results from the multiple analyses are combined in order to provide statistical inferences regarding the

data
Depending on the type and pattern of missing data, SAS/STAT and SPSS will generate estimates for the missing
values using some form of regression analysis of the valid data (single, multiple or logistic regression), or MCMC
methods under an assumption of multivariate Normality, for more general missing values. The latter approach is
of the general form: (a) initialize estimates for the missing values for all records and variables by drawing random
values from a Normal distribution with mean and variance that match the non-missing data (or use a multinomial
distribution for categorical data, with proportions in each class defined by the proportions in the non-missing
data); (b) using all the data, except for missing data on the j th variable, use a univariate method (e.g.
regression) to impute the missing values in that variable; (c) iterate across all variables and track the
convergence of both the mean and variance of the imputed missing values.

When the datasets are analyzed the results are combined to produce a single set of inferences together with the
between and within imputed dataset covariances. As Rubin (1996, p476, [RUB3]) explains, the posterior
distribution of the data obtained following multiple imputations is simply the average of the individual
imputations, the mean values are the means of the imputations, and the variances are the sum of the average of
the individual variances obtained from the MI process plus the variance of the mean values obtained.

Statistical error

Statistical error

When approaching any form of data analysis many types and sources of error may be considered: the data
collection procedure may contain errors; there may be gross data capture or encoding errors; there may be errors
in the approach adopted to selecting data, designs or in analysis. However, none of these relates to the rather
special use of the term statistical error. This term refers specifically to non-systematic or random errors that are
observed during measurement. There may be many reasons why such random variations occur, but in general the
assumption is made that these reasons are unknowable and therefore cannot be readily removed. Systematic
variations and gross errors can, at least in theory, be separated out and either accounted for or removed, leaving
simply statistical error.

Statistics in Medical Research

Statistical methods as applied to problems in medical research are, at first sight, no different from the
application of such methods to any area of scientific endeavor. However, there are some important societal and
technical aspects of medical research that warrant particular attention. At the societal level the issues relate to
the impact on individual patients of intervention procedures, treatments and their side effects. The conduct and
interpretation of medical trials is an extremely important issue, and decisions made regarding who is to be
treated and how, and who is not to be treated, are often complex and can be distressing for all involved.
Furthermore, inadequate design, implementation and reporting of trials can lead to erroneous conclusions, with
potentially serious consequences. On a technical level there are specific techniques and protocols that have been
developed to address many of these issues, but there remains continuing difficulties facing medical staff who
need to understand and use appropriate statistical procedures whilst having an enormous number of other issues
to deal with. Again, these problems can be addressed by early involvement of medical statisticians, although the
scarcity of experienced specialists in this field is an additional concern. There is also an ongoing debate regarding
the appropriateness of classical frequentist statistics, and even Bayesian statistics to many problems in medical
research, bearing in mind the practical complexities and uncertainties associated with such work, especially for
observational studies.
In 1937, the editor of The Lancet, writing in the foreword of Austin Bradford Hill's groundbreaking book
"Principles of Medical Statistics" [BH1] summarized the position of statistics in medicine at that time as follows:
"In clinical medicine today there is a growing demand for adequate proof of the efficacy of this or that form
of treatment. Often proof can come only by means of a collection of records of clinical trials devised on such
a scale and in such a form that statistically reliable conclusions can be drawn from them. However great
might be our aversion to figures, we cannot escape the conclusion that the solution of most of the problems
of clinical or preventative medicine must ultimately depend on them"
Bradford Hill sought to provide an easily understood introduction to statistical concepts and methods for medical
students, and his book [BH1] continued to be updated and published in many editions and in many translations,
over a period of forty years. He was particularly concerned to ensure that the foundations of medical research
benefited from sound underlying logical analysis and testing. To this end he was one of the initial proponents of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which provide a key framework for current medical research exercises. In
addition he devised a series of viewpoints on how suspected cause-effect relationships can be evaluated. Both of
these areas are discussed in more detail below.
Bradford Hill was also extremely influential in bringing the idea of cohort studies to the fore through his work
with Sir Richard Doll on the link between smoking and lung cancer. Their initial research was based on a casecontrol approach, but they then extended this work to a cohort study of over 30,000 British doctors. Cohort
studies typically involve tracking the medical histories of a select group or cohort of individuals over many years.
For example, in 2010 an international cohort study known as COSMOS was launched. The UK COSMOS cohort will
follow the health of approximately 100,000 mobile phone users (18+ years old) for 20-30 years, and the
international cohort will follow approximately 250,000 European mobile phone users over this period.
Considerable efforts have been made by many specialists with the aim of improving the understanding of
statistics by medical professionals and in ensuring the quality of reporting in journal publications is of the highest
standard (see especially, the excellent article and associated discussion in Altman and Bland, 1991 [ALT1], and

Journal and more directly via Professor Bland's web page). The quality of published studies has been greatly aided
by the production or adoption of guidelines by individual journals, and by the development of "statements" that
explain how different types of research exercise should be reported. Perhaps the most important of these is
CONSORT: "Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials", which encompasses various initiatives to alleviate the
problems arising from inadequate reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We discuss CONSORT further
below. Other examples of such statements include STROBE "Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies
in Epidemiology", and the EQUATOR network, which is an international effort that seeks to "improve the
reliability and value of medical research literature by promoting transparent and accurate reporting of research
studies". Their 'reporting guidelines' section includes links to many useful websites and articles, including those
already mentioned, and articles such as Olson et al. [OLS1] on the reporting of case-control studies.
As mentioned earlier, undertaking and reporting of medical research requires many specialized skills. Historically
there has been insufficient training of medical researchers in statistical concepts and methods, and very real
problems of communication between medical and statistical specialists. For example, the terms significance,
variance and frequency may have a very different meaning to medical staff from those assigned by statisticians.
To medics significance has the more usual interpretation of 'being significant' or important in the context of the
medical problem under consideration — indeed, statisticians and medical journals now often play down the use of
the term and the associated use of statistical significance levels (p-values). Estimation (identifying the typical
range of values/effects) is rightly regarded as being of far greater relevance. For those involved in case-mix
management (CMM) analysis of variance may refer to financial management (variation from targets) rather than
having any statistical interpretation, whilst frequency can refer to how often a patient visits the toilet! As with
many disciplines, technical terminology unfortunately may serve to confuse rather than clarify the subject.
There is no simple answer to these problems, although modern undergraduate and post-graduate teaching
practice attempts to address the most important issues in a manner that medical specialists are likely to respond
to and retain, long after the brief courses given have been completed. The leading medical journals, key medical
reference web sites, the early involvement of medical statisticians, statistical consultancy and peer review,
recently published precedents and the application of sound methodologies (such as the PPDAC model discussed
earlier in this Handbook) will all serve to assist those engaging in medical research and trials for the first time.
The technical statistical procedures applicable to medical research are covered in the various main topics and
sections of this Handbook. However, there are one or two specific topics that warrant further comment at this
juncture. The two we have focused upon are Causation, and the Conduct and Reporting of Research. Each of
these topics is discussed briefly in the subsections that follow.
An equally important topic, which is of particular relevance to medical research, is that of Bayesian analysis. We
discuss aspects of Bayesian analysis at several points in this Handbook (e.g. see Yudowsky's example of breast
cancer screening). Whilst not excluding classical frequentist statistics, a substantial number of scientists believe
that Bayesian thinking is essential in the medical sphere — as Professor Campbell states in his commentary on
Altman and Bland's paper (see also [CAM1]):
"Many doctors have an 'a priori' belief that the patient either has or does not have the disease and use the
Bayesian paradigm to modify their beliefs. They find the idea of a null hypothesis existing without any
probability attached to it counter-intuitive"
Other authors, including the leading Bayesian statistician Professor David Spiegelhalter, argue that for some
problems only a Bayesian approach can provide a sensible answer, or in some instances, any answer at all.

We now take a closer look at the thorny question of causality, and how suspected cause-effect relationships can
be identified and studied. We then consider some aspects of the conduct and reporting of medical research,
including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control studies and cohort studies. These procedures are a
particular feature of modern medical research and RCT in particular is a development that has been largely
championed in the medical statistics field.

2.7.1

Causation

In our earlier discussion of the problems associated with using and interpreting statistical data we described some
of the difficulties involved when trying to establish and model causation. As Rothman et al. (2008, p5 [ROT1])
observe:
"such a model should address problems of multifactorial causation, confounding, interdependence of effects,
direct and indirect effects, levels of causation, and systems or webs of causation"
In medical statistics the word cause is often used in a probabilistic sense, i.e. by suggesting that factor A is a
cause of outcome or disease B, we often mean that A significantly increases the risk or probability of outcome B.
This lack of specificity reflects an underlying uncertainty about the detailed processes at work. Hence recognizing
that a particular chemical is carcinogenic does not explain the processes that lead from exposure to incidence of
the condition — these processes are likely to be extremely complicated involving molecular biology, and may be
difficult if not impossible to determine.
In a famous paper delivered by Austin Bradford Hill to the Royal Society of Medicine in 1965 [BH2], he suggested a
series of viewpoints (his terminology) by which one might use as guidance when seeking to establish the nature
and validity of a suspected causal relation. In this subsection we summarize what has now become known as the
Bradford Hill Criteria, although the term criteria was not used in his paper. He commences with the assumption
that a clear-cut association (or correlation) of some kind has been observed. This association does not need to be
one that is determined as statistically significant — in fact, Bradford Hill argues strongly against the blind use of
statistical significance in this context. In addition and as noted above, the causal relationship may in fact be
complex, as for example in a causal chain, or in an effect that may be the result of multiple (i.e. different)
causal factors or the result of several factors working in combination. Bradford Hill's nine viewpoints for
examining possible causal effects are, in summary:

https://www.statsref.com

86

Statistics in Medical Research

Bradford Hill's (1965) 9 Viewpoints for Causation
1. Strength: if an association is very strong it deserves closer consideration than weaker associations — for
example, if we observe that heavy smokers are 30+ times more likely to contract lung cancer than nonsmokers, the strength of evidence is more powerful than if we observed that they were only 2x as likely to
contract lung cancer. In fact it was Bradford Hill who first brought this particular relationship to public
attention. On the other hand, lower strength of evidence does not imply that there is no causal relationship
2. Consistency: is the observed association repeated/repeatable, in different locations, at different times and
under differing circumstances? As above, the absence of such repeatability does not imply that there is no
causal relationship — for example, it may not be possible to repeat a set of circumstances
3. Specificity: if the observed association appears to be highly specific to a given set of circumstances and/or
locations, then it is more likely to be related to these circumstances in some causal manner. For example, the
very high incidence of certain diseases amongst individuals working in very specific environments (e.g.
chimney sweeps and felt hat makers in the 18th and 19th centuries; Nickel refinery workers in the early 20th
century). A somewhat different example is the incidence of pre-menopausal breast cancers where a high
number of cases has been observed within particular families across the generations, suggesting a specific
genetic effect
4. Temporality: here the question is whether the order is A®B or B¬A. For example, is being extremely
overweight causing people to contract a particular disease or condition, or do people with a particular
condition become extremely overweight. These kinds of relationships can be quite subtle and inter-connected
5. Biological gradient: if increased exposure to some well-defined hazard is associated with a similarly increase
in disease incidence, then this tends to support a causal relationship, as compared with a relationship for
which no 'gradient effect' is observed
6. Plausibility: if the suspected causal relationship is plausible, within the scope of current knowledge, then it
has (marginally) more merit than a relationship for which no known explanation can be proposed. Having
made this observation, it is clearly a relatively weak criterion
7. Coherence: if the suspected causal relationship is consistent with current knowledge about the variables
involved, it may help to support (or at least, not to detract from) the possible causal relationship being
considered. Again, as with plausibility, this may be regarded as a relatively weak criterion
8. Experiment: if one or more repeatable controlled experiments can be carried out to test the suspected
causality, and these tests support the hypothesis, this greatly enhances the strength of evidence case
9. Analogy: if a similar causal relationship has been established, but under different circumstances, it may again
provide support for the argument that a causal relationship exists, but again this is a weak criterion

These 9 viewpoints have been taught to students in the biomedical sciences for many years, often as criteria
rather than as broad guidance. More recently authors such as Phillips and Goodman [PH1] have re-emphasized the
original 'lessons' of Bradford Hill, in particular his skepticism regarding the use of statistical significance. In their
commentary they summarize these missing lessons as:
· Statistical significance should not be mistaken for evidence of a substantial association
· Association does not prove causation (other evidence must be considered)
· Precision should not be mistaken for validity (non-random errors may exist)

· Evidence (or belief) that there is a causal relationship is not sufficient to suggest action should be taken
· Uncertainty about whether there is a causal relationship (or even an association) is not sufficient to suggest

action should not be taken
In preparing these bullet points the authors were particularly concerned to address the question of systematic
errors or bias, which we have previously seen can be complex and inadvertently introduced, thereby confusing
both intuitive and statistical inference. They also emphasize the importance of the relationship between causal
analysis and the subsequent decision making regarding policies such as screening, interventions and vaccination.
These policies exist in a much broader framework of political and economic considerations, requiring weighted
cost-benefit and risk-based assessments, whatever the apparent strength of evidence may be from causal
analysis.
Evans (1976, (EVA1]) focused on identification of cause-effect relationships for diseases, rather than the
generality of such relations. His "criteria for causation" table, developed as a form of unification of the ideas and
research by many authors over the previous century, but curiously without reference to Bradford Hill, is provided
below (with his italics):

Evans' (1976, Table 13) 10 Criteria for Causation
1. Prevalence of the disease should be significantly higher in those exposed to the putative cause than in cases
[or] controls not so exposed
2. Exposure should be present more commonly in those with the disease than in controls without the disease
when all the risk factors are held constant
3. Incidence of the disease should be significantly higher in those exposed than in those not exposed as shown in
prospective studies
4. Temporally, the disease should follow exposure with a distribution of incubation periods on a bell shaped
curve
5. A spectrum of host responses should follow exposure along a logical biological gradient from mild to severe
6. A measurable host response following exposure should regularly appear in those lacking this before exposure
or should increase in magnitude if present before exposure
7. Experimental reproduction of the disease should occur in higher incidence in animals or man appropriately
exposed than in those not so exposed; this exposure may be deliberate in volunteers, experimentally induced
in the laboratory, or demonstrated in a controlled regulation of natural exposure
8. Elimination or modification of the putative cause or the vector carrying it should decrease the incidence of
the disease
9. Prevention or modification of the host's response on exposure should decrease or eliminate the disease (e.g.
immunization, application of statins to reduce cholesterol), and
10. Sense: the whole thing should make biologic and epidemiological sense

There are a number of formal and informal tools and procedures that may be utilized to assist in the analysis of
the relationships between supposed causes and effects (i.e. in addition to purely statistical approaches). In many
fields, including medical research, structured diagrams are often helpful, for example the use of traditional graph

theory such as the work of Greenland et al. [GR1, ROT1] which uses the analysis of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
to help identify and understand cause-effect relationships and confounding. A number of authors in the medical
field have also used the Ishikawa or fishbone diagram as an aid to identifying the components and structure of
causation particularly in the context of quality management and policy making. Formal structured review
procedures, such as brainstorming and Delphi techniques, and of course the entire peer review process for
research work and publications, collectively provide a range of mechanisms for obtaining the best possible
understanding of possible cause-effect relationships.

2.7.2

Conduct and reporting of medical research

When planning any substantive piece of medical research, especially where human patients are involved, great
care in the design of the research is required. Whilst the PPDAC methodological framework described above has
broad applicability to such problems, there are specific considerations that make such exercises in the medical
arena particularly problematic (e.g. see the discussion in Ercan et al., 2007 [ERC1]). Many of these are addressed
through adoption, where practicable, of a procedure known as randomized controlled trials, or RCTs. In its
simplest, and most widely used form, the RCT is a relatively straightforward procedure — at least, in theory!
Other widely used forms of medical research include case-control studies and cohort studies. All three of these
procedures are described in greater detail in the subsections that follow.
Assuming a trial or other form of study has been designed and is undertaken, the question of reporting all steps in
the process is paramount. In recent years there has been a great deal of effort put into standardizing the
registration of the details of trials (essentially metadata), and into structured reporting. This has been led by the
academic community in association with all the major medical journals, and has led to a series of "statements"
that are designed to both assist and direct the conduct of trials. Journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine,

BMC Medicine, BMJ, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, the Lancet, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Open Medicine, PLoS
Medicine and Trials have all adopted and published guidelines for reporting randomized trials under the CONSORT
or "Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials" initiative. CONSORT 2010 is the latest version of these guidelines,
and comprises specifically the process of reporting what was done and what was found (i.e. it does not include
recommendations for designing, conducting or analyzing trials). Essentially CONSORT consists of a checklist for
publication which covers: Title and abstract; Introduction; Methods; Randomization; Results; Discussion and Other
information. It also includes a flow diagram "of the progress through the phases of a parallel randomized trial of
two groups", which we have included below. More details can be found on the EQUATOR NETWORK website and in
the references below. There are also a number of extensions to the CONSORT statement that provide guidance
for different forms of trials, such as cluster trials (e.g. where treatments are applied to clusters, such as
members of a family) and a number of other forms of trial.

As noted above, RCT's are by no means the only, or always the best or most appropriate framework for the
conduct of medical trials. In many instances the 'ideal' of a controlled experiment is not achievable, and many
other forms of research are also widely used — for example cohort studies and case-control studies. However, the
great advantage of RCT's is that they have been shown, within the strict confines of the trial in question, to be
the best means for avoiding bias and minimizing confounding effects, enabling conclusions regarding the
differences between outcomes to be made with a relatively high degree of confidence.

2.7.2.1

Randomized controlled trials

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is generally accepted as the preferred approach to conducting a wide
variety of medical trials and is a central technique in the broader field of evidence-based medicine. The
advantages of the approach are many, but in particular they have been shown to be very effective in controlling
for selection bias and confounding, which other procedures may fail to achieve. In order to explain the central
ideas behind RCTs, we start by providing a brief description below of the steps involved in the very first RCT,
which was designed to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment for tuberculosis (TB).
The first step when designing an RCT is to carefully define the problem to be studied. Ideally this definition
should be easily understood and as narrow as is practical. In the British Medical Research Council's (MRC) study of
tuberculosis treatments in the late 1940s, the trial (of the effectiveness of streptomycin as a treatment) was
defined by restricting it to: "acute progressive bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis of presumably recent origin,
bacteriologically proved, unsuitable for collapse therapy, age group 15 to 25 (later extended to 30)" [BH1;
Ch.20, and [MRC1]). This particular trial was the first truly randomized clinical trial and this aspect of the trial
was devised by Austin Bradford Hill — he himself had been diagnosed with TB and spent two years in hospital and
a further two years convalescing from the disease in his early 20s.
The second step, in the most commonly applied form of RCT, is to consider two distinct groups, ideally of
approximately equal size and make-up. In the tuberculosis trial 55 patients were given the new treatment
(Streptomycin plus bed rest) whilst a separate group of 52 patients were just given bed rest. One group is the

https://www.statsref.com

92

Statistics in Medical Research

treatment group (or intervention group) whilst the other is the non-treatment group or control group. By nontreatment we mean that this group receives a placebo (i.e. a tablet or preparation that is not a drug at all and
has no physiological effect on the patient), or no treatment, or continues on an existing, established treatment
programme — the approach chosen must be precisely defined.
The patients selected to be involved in the trial are then randomly allocated to one of the two groups and their
progress monitored over a period of time (usually relatively short). Most RCTs now carried out follow this general
approach. There are other variants, notably cross-over RCTs, where patients are randomly assigned to groups but
are then randomly re-assigned so they receive a sequence of treatments or non-treatments.
In the case of the 1948 tuberculosis trial the results after 6 months were as follows:
Streptomycin

Control

improvement

28 (51%)

4 (8%)

Lesser
improvement or
deterioration

23 (42%)

34 (65%)

4 (7%)

14 (27%)

Deaths

This finding was regarded as being an important breakthrough, both in terms of the success of the treatment,
which was clear to see, and statistically significant (i.e. is extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance). After
12 months a further 8 of the treated patients had died, and a further 10 of the control group, again a significant
result, but also indicating a reduced efficacy of the treatment over time. None of the patients, however, could
be regarded as having been cured. Interestingly enough, at the time the authors did not report why they chose
the sample sizes used. In a remarkable recorded interview in 1990 Bradford Hill, then aged 93, stated that the
main reason for choosing 50 or so patients was that this was as much Streptomycin as could be obtained from the
USA at the time given its scarcity, high cost and the considerable problems in obtaining US currency in the UK in
the immediate post-WWII period. He also stated that the patients were not informed about the treatment they
were to receive (i.e. there was no "informed consent" which is nowadays an absolute requirement for such trials).
The authors also do not describe what form of statistical analysis was performed, merely that the results were
statistically significant — the impression one has from Bradford Hill's book is that simple chi-square tests were
carried out.
In order to carry out random assignment of patients to groups, the researchers who were treating the patients in
the trial allocated patients themselves to the trial groups using random numbers, but this method can lead to
problems. An example is given by Cancer Research UK:
"it is possible to be biased without realizing it. For example, if a new treatment has quite bad side effects,
the doctors running the trial might subconsciously avoid putting sicker patients into the group having the
new treatment. So as the trial went on, the control group would have more and more of the sickest patients
in it. The people in the new treatment group would then do better than the control group. So, when the trial
results come out, the new treatment would [incorrectly] look as if it works better than the standard
treatment."
To avoid such problems a system known as blinding is applied. In blind trials one or more parties are unaware of
the assignment of treatments. For example, in a so-called single-blind trial the individual receiving the treatment
is not made aware whether the treatment they are being given is an existing treatment, a new treatment or a

93

placebo. In double-blind trials neither the experimenter nor the patient know which treatment has been assigned
to which patient (treatments are coded) thereby minimizing the risk of any influence the experimenter may have
on the experiment. Unfortunately this terminology is not uniformly applied, leading to current recommendations
to describe in detail the kind of blinding applied (if any), even extending to those involved in analysis and
interpretation of the results.
Whilst the RCT procedure described above appears simple and straightforward, it does have difficulties.
Determining the appropriate sample size to use can be problematic, especially in the case of rarer conditions
and/or where suitable triallists are simply not available in the location or at the period of time required (see the
earlier discussion on sample size, and in particular, the Salk Polio vaccine trials of 1954). It is clear that sample
size and retention of participants needs careful thought and prior research to determine the sort of effect that
the treatment or intervention might have and the size of effect that would be considered clinically useful (and
therefore worth powering the trial to detect). To achieve the required sample size it is quite usual for a trial to
be run with several participating centers in different parts of the country, or even to be international, with
participating centers from several countries.
The cost of conducting RCT trials may be high, and if the trial is interrupted during its structured program, or
there are problems with adverse effects or triallists dropping out, how are the results to be interpreted? Sample
size determination can be difficult and it may not be possible to obtain the desired numbers in each group and
stratum or to obtain the overall desired sample size if it is far larger than is achievable within time and cost
constraints. Having an appropriate sample size is an ethical issue because too small a trial is unlikely to give a
useful result, so cannot justify the cost and patient time involved, and too large a trial similarly wastes money
and patient time. There may also be other ethical problems — for example, should a particular treatment that is
thought to be very promising be withheld from very sick patients? (see further, the Declaration of Helsinki).
Despite these reservations, RCTs do provide the "gold standard" for conducting many types of medical trial, and
have provided to be extremely successful including in trials involving complex interventions — see for example
John et al. [JOH1], Kinmonth et al. [KIN1] and the BUMPES (Birth in Upright Maternal Position) Trial [BUMPES].

2.7.2.2

Case-control studies

Case-control studies involve investigations that are essentially retrospective in nature, since they involve the
study of patients who have acquired a disease or condition, and comparing these cases with so-called 'controls'
whose profile is similar to the cases. By similar we mean that the controls have not exhibited the condition under
investigation but have considerable similarities with those who have — for example, they have the same age/sex
mix, they live in the same area, do similar work, attended similar schools etc. In some instances case-control
studies involve multiple control groups, but more typically there is one group of cases and another of controls. As
with other forms of medical research procedures, we provide an example below to illustrate the typical
application of this approach. In this example we consider the analysis of data relating to the incidence of a
particular disease amongst individuals who have been exposed to some infectious agent, substance or
environmental factor which is suspected as being causative. The simplest model is to assume that the row and
column totals are known and fixed and then to apply Fisher’s exact test to the results. This model evaluates the
hypothesis that the results show no association between disease incidence and exposure and is a simple and clear
procedure.

Example: Esophageal cancer cases in Brittany
In the example table below we show the incidence of esophageal cancer amongst males in part of Brittany in
France (205 cases) and a sample of 770 males (the controls) selected at random from the local electoral lists in
the same region. Examining the tabulated summary results we see that the odds of being a high consumer of
alcohol for cases is 96:109 (i.e. almost 1:1) whereas for controls the ratio is 104:666 (around 1:7). The odds ratio
is thus (96/109)/(104/666)=5.64. Put another way, the data suggest that you are at least 5 times more likely to
suffer from esophageal cancer if you are a heavy drinker than if you are a more moderate drinker. To place this
into context, a 125ml glass of 8% strength wine (very weak, most wines are 12-13%) equates to 10gms of alcohol
or one unit (in international measure), with the current recommended daily maximum consumption being 2 units
for women (20mg) and 3 units (30mg) for men.

This data and its analysis is discussed in detail in Breslow and Day (1980, [BRE1]). The lower case letters identify
the notation used in many studies, with the odds ratio being computed simply as ad/bc.
We can compute Fisher’s exact statistic for this 2x2 table, and the chi-square approximation, on the hypothesis
that the entries are independent. The chi-square statistic yields a value of 110.26 (unadjusted) or 108.22 with
Yates adjustment, both highly significant. The exact test, using Fisher’s method as implemented in R, also
confirms that the result is highly significant and also provides the odds ratio, as above, together with a 95%
confidence interval for this ratio of [3.94,8.06]. These values are the so-called Cornfield confidence intervals
(Cornfield, 1956, reported in Breslow and Day [BRE1]). These statistical tests can be seen as test of the
hypothesis that the odds ratio equals 1 against the alternative that it is greater than 1.

The data under discussion have been greatly simplified — detailed information which is available has been
summarized in a 2x2 table. Whilst this is helpful and demonstrates an apparently very strong relationship
between the incidence of this type of cancer with high alcohol consumption, it disguises potentially important
information and possible confounding factors. For example, it was known that the individuals in the control data
in this study were, on average, 10 years younger than the case data. Since alcohol consumption may vary with
age, perhaps an age-related confounding factor exists. Indeed, since the ages of cases and controls are known,
the data could be stratified by age group and each stratum analyzed separately. The odds ratios for each group
can be computed and compared to see how homogeneous these are, assuming sufficient data exists at each
stratum level for such a comparison. Likewise, the division of alcohol consumption into two levels rather than
more is somewhat arbitrary, thus analysis of cases and controls could be extended to obtain a more detailed
picture of this relationship (with or without age-based stratification). Clearly as the number of levels and strata
are increased, so the cell entries will diminish and without relatively large samples the scope for detailed
breakdowns of this type will be limited. Also, the Fisher test for tables with more than a 2x2 arrangement is
typically implemented using simulation methods. Finally, the dataset also collected information on tobacco
consumption — perhaps the strong relationship observed for alcohol consumption is actually not causative but
indicative of lifestyle. By including tobacco consumption levels as well as alcohol consumption, for cases and
controls, estimates of relative risks (by age group) can be obtained.
The above study, dating from more than 40 years ago, contrasts with larger scale more recent studies, such as
the case-control study of smoker-related deaths in India. The authors (Jha et al., 2008, [JAH1]) describe their
methodology as follows:
In a nationally representative sample of 1.1 million homes, we compared the prevalence of smoking among
33,000 deceased women and 41,000 deceased men (case subjects) with the prevalence of smoking among
35,000 living women and 43,000 living men (unmatched control subjects). Mortality risk ratios comparing
smokers with nonsmokers were adjusted for age, educational level, and use of alcohol.... In this age group
[30-69], smoking was associated with an increased risk of death from any medical cause among both women
(risk ratio, 2.0; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 2.3) and men (risk ratio, 1.7; 99% CI, 1.6 to 1.8). Daily
smoking of even a small amount of tobacco was associated with increased mortality. Excess deaths among
smokers, as compared with nonsmokers, were chiefly from tuberculosis among both women (risk ratio, 3.0;
99% CI, 2.4 to 3.9) and men (risk ratio, 2.3; 99% CI, 2.1 to 2.6) and from respiratory, vascular, or neoplastic
disease
In both of the above analyses controls were not tightly matched to cases — for example, their age profile and
possible other important factors, were not matched other than at a broad level. In some instances carefully
matched controls can be identified which generally increases the power of the analysis. Typically more controls
than cases are identified, and analysis proceeds either by taking the first or a randomly selected matched control
from a set, or by combining the controls as if they represented a single individual. Procedures for analyzing
matched controls, which are variants of those described above, are covered in Breslow and Day [BRE1]. For more
complex problems it may be preferable to apply techniques based on logistic regression, with unmatched or
matched samples.

Cohort studies

Cohort studies primarily consist of the selection of a group of individuals (the cohort) and studying aspects of
their development over many years, possibly several decades. In particular, disease incidence and mortality of
the cohort are studied. As with case-control studies and randomized control trials, the unit of analysis is the
individual, i.e. macro-level relationships amongst groups (i.e. population correlation or ecological studies) are not
the basis for research in any of these methods. At the start of the process members of the cohort are recruited,
generally with a carefully constructed profile that is designed to embrace the study population of interest, and
detailed interviews are conducted to learn relevant information about their background, health history, lifestyle
etc. Further interviews and/or questionnaires are then conducted every few years over the course of the project.
The great advantage of this approach, which is known as a prospective cohort study, is that information about
the individuals is well documented and all subsequent disease incidence is recorded, in many cases up to
eventual death. However, this may take a long time and may exhibit only a few cases of the specific disease or
diseases of interest unless a very large cohort is used, which increases the cost and complexity of the project.
Retrospective or historical cohort studies seek to identify a group or cohort with known exposure to a suspected
agent, and then attempt to reconstruct the history of exposure and related data in order to obtain an
understanding about current disease incidence and mortality patterns. This approach has the advantage that data
is available relatively quickly and without excessive expense, may be the only possible approach (for example if a
substance or circumstance no longer applies), but is subject to many practical problems — notably missing data
and recall problems.
Prospective cohort studies may be compared with a case-control approach, for which cases are selected from
those with a disease of interest, controls are selected, and the two datasets are compared. For example, in the
very first major cohort study, that of British Doctors commencing in 1951, some 34,440 male doctors were
recruited to the study, and after 20 years total incidence of lung case deaths was 441. This compares with a casecontrol study that commenced in 1948 and was completed in 1952, with 4342 people being involved and 1488
being lung cancer cases. The advantages of case-control studies for identifying possible relationships of
importance is clear, and they are much faster and typically less costly to conduct, but they are severely limited in
the degree of confidence in the nature of the relationship and by their reliance on recalled information. With a
cohort study an improved understanding of the relationship between exposure, lifestyle and outcomes is possible,
including effects not previously identified. For example, in the British Doctors study it was apparent, after 20
years, that the death rate amongst heavy smokers from all causes was twice that of non-smokers. In this example
the level of long-term successful follow-up of the cohort was very high, but in other studies this has not been the
case. Unless the results are available for a very high proportion of the cohort, the validity of the results may be
called into question.
In summary, Breslow and Day [BRE2] identify the following advantages of cohort studies as compared with casecontrol studies. Cohort studies:
· Give a wider picture of the health hazards associated with a given exposure

· Eliminate most forms of selection bias and recall bias
· Are often the only practical option where exposure to specific agents (e.g. suspected hazardous industrial

chemicals) is rare
· In addition to detailed interviews or questionnaires, medical tests can be carried out at the start of the cohort

study that may aid interpretation of outcomes, for example in terms of prior susceptibility to certain conditions
· Repeated measurements over the lifetime of the study may be possible and important — for example,

measurements of specific chemicals present in blood or urine samples
· Absolute risk rates are obtained for the cohort, as opposed to relative risk rates for case-control studies.

However, if the cohort is not representative of the broader population these risk estimates cannot be extended
without reservation
An additional aspect of cohort studies is the fact that they can look at length of survival, rather than simply the
outcome at a single time point (see for example, Svensson et al., [SVE1], where the authors analyzed the survival
rate of patients with bone cancer after 1, 3 and 5 years ).
Historically, most attention has been focused on mortality whereas more recently interest has been shown in a
combination of severity of various conditions (e.g. chronic illnesses) and the detail of dose-response relationships,
both of which are more demanding in terms of data (e.g. obtaining an understanding of multi-factor effects) and
analytical methods. For dose-response analysis much emphasis is placed on fitting alternative models to data
collected over time, using various forms of time series analysis to help model, and thereby predict, safe exposure
or dose levels in absolute and temporal terms.

2.7.2.4

Meta analysis

In order to increase the power of a test it may be possible to examine many similar studies and combine their
findings into an overall analysis, thereby increasing the effective sample size. The advantages of this approach
are obvious, in that existing published and peer-reviewed research from separate studies around the world can be
combined to strengthen the analytical process. Special statistical techniques have been developed to support
meta-analysis [BOR1], and graphics such as the forest plot (see below) have been designed to clarify both the
similarities and differences between the separate studies. The problems associated with the approach are also
self-evident: different studies will inevitably have been produced under differing circumstances, on different
groups of subjects, with varying levels and types of control; and only published studies tend to be compared, so
there is a (significant) risk that a bias towards studies that show results, rather than no-result studies, are
combined (see Goldacre, [GOL1], for a lengthy discussion of this issue); likewise there is a risk of selection bias,
whereby only studies that confirm a hypothesis are selected, again resulting in potentially serious distortion of
the results.

The following forest plot was produced using the R function forestplot() in the rmeta meta-analysis package using
data from the highly influential Cochrane Collaboration ("Cochrane", www.cochrane.org). The data comes from 7
randomized trials before 1980 of corticosteroid therapy in premature labor and its effect on neonatal death
(corticosteroids are given to women in premature labor help the babies' lungs to mature and so reduce the
number of babies who die or suffer breathing problems at birth). The plot shows the odds ratio (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals in each study, together with an estimated combined (summary) odds ratio computed using
the Mantel-Haenszel OR fixed effects method [MAN1]. This is simply a form of weighted version of the standard
odds ratio ad/bc applied to each of k tables, where the sample sizes are the ni values (the fixed effects
assumption involves regarding each study as evaluating the same overall treatment effect):
k

ORMH 



aidi
ni



bici
ni

i1
k

i1

The overall OR in this case is 0.53, and the width of the diamond shows the confidence intervals for this
estimate, which are [0.39,0.73]. Where the odds ratio is less than 1 (the vertical line shown) it indicates that the
treatment (in this case the use of steroids) reduces the chances that the baby will die — in this example, by
approximately 50% as a best estimate. Each line on the forest plot relates to a separate trial, and smaller trials
are shown with longer horizontal lines to indicate that they are less certain of their results (the width of possible
OR values is greater). As can be seen, several trials have horizontal lines that cross the OR=1 (no effect) line, so
taken individually the impression is given that use of these steroids may well not be effective. However, by
combining all the trials the beneficial effect of treatment becomes clear.
An overall random effects model and summary is also available in the rmeta package, which in this case produces
the same OR estimate of 0.53 but a slightly wider confidence interval: [0.37,0.78]. The random effects model,
due to DerSimonian and Laird (DSL), assumes that there is random variation in treatment effects and estimates
the mean and variance of the effect. The scale illustrated is logarithmic with limits set at [0.1,2.5] and the
arrows indicate that the confidence intervals extend beyond these limits, i.e. the limits have been clipped or
trimmed (software packages vary on the methods used to compute confidence intervals for combined studies).
The box size illustrated is based on the study precision.

Forest plots can be used in a variety of ways — for example, in the 2004 collaborative study of European casecontrol studies into the levels of radon in homes and the associated risk of death from lung cancer [DAR1], the
authors displayed the results from 13 studies with stratification for age, sex, smoking habits and cancer histology,
with the horizontal scale indicating the percentage increase in the risk of lung cancer per 100Bq/m2 of measured
Radon (i.e. not an OR plot in this instance). A subset of their plot is shown below:
