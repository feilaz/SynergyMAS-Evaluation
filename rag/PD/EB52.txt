PREFACE
Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing: Materials, Processes, and Systems is designed
for a first course or two-course sequence in manufacturing at the junior level in
mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering curricula. Given its coverage
of engineering materials, it is also suitable for materials science and engineering courses
that emphasize materials processing. Finally, it may be appropriate for technology
programs related to the preceding engineering disciplines. Most of the book’s content
is concerned with manufacturing processes (about 65% of the text), but it also provides
significant coverage of engineering materials and production systems. Materials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of modern manufacturing and the three
broad subject areas covered in the book.

APPROACH
The author’s objective in this edition and its predecessors is to provide a treatment of
manufacturing that is modern and quantitative. Its claim to be ‘‘modern’’ is based on (1) its
balanced coverage of the basic engineering materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, and
composite materials), (2) its inclusion of recently developed manufacturing processes in
addition to the traditional processes that have been used and refined over many years, and
(3) its comprehensive coverage of electronics manufacturing technologies. Competing
textbooks tend to emphasize metals and their processing at the expense of the other
engineering materials, whose applications and methods of processing have grown significantly in the last several decades. Also, most competing books provide minimum coverage
of electronics manufacturing. Yet the commercial importance of electronics products and
their associated industries have increased substantially during recent decades.
The book’s claim to be more ‘‘quantitative’’ is based on its emphasis on manufacturing
science and its greater use of mathematical models and quantitative (end-of-chapter) problems than other manufacturing textbooks. In the case of some processes, it was the first manufacturing processes book to ever provide a quantitative engineering coverage of the topic.

NEW TO THIS EDITION
This fourth edition is an updated version of the third edition. The publisher’s instructions to
the author were to increase content but reduce page count. As this preface is being written,
it is too early to tell whether the page count is reduced, but the content has definitely been
increased. Additions and changes in the fourth edition include the following:
å The chapter count has been reduced from 45 to 42 through consolidation of several
chapters.
å Selected end-of-chapter problems have been revised to make use of PC spread sheet
calculations.
å A new section on trends in manufacturing has been added in Chapter 1.

Preface

å Chapter 5 on dimensions, tolerances, and surfaces has been modified to include
measuring and gauging techniques used for these part features.
å A new section on specialty steels has been added to Chapter 8 on metals.
å Sections on polymer recycling and biodegradable plastics have been added in
Chapter 8 on polymers.
å Several new casting processes are discussed in Chapter 11.
å Sections on thread cutting and gear cutting have been added in Chapter 22 on
machining operations and machine tools.
å Several additional hole-making tools have been included in Chapter 23 on cutting
tool technology.
å Former Chapters 28 and 29 on industrial cleaning and coating processes have been
consolidated into a single chapter.
å A new section on friction-stir welding has been added to Chapter 30 on welding
processes.
å Chapter 37 on nanotechnology has been reorganized with several new topics and
processes added.
å The three previous Chapters 39, 40, and 41on manufacturing systems have been
consolidated into two chapters: Chapter 38 titled Automation for Manufacturing
Systems and Chapter 39 on Integrated Manufacturing Systems. New topics covered
in these chapters include automation components and material handling
technologies.
å Former Chapters 44 on Quality Control and 45 on Measurement and Inspection have
been consolidated into a single chapter, Chapter 42 titled Quality Control and
Inspection. New sections have been added on Total Quality Management, Six Sigma,
and ISO 9000. The text on conventional measuring techniques has been moved to
Chapter 5.

OTHER KEY FEATURES
Additional features of the book continued from the third edition include the following:
å A DVD showing action videos of many of the manufacturing processes is included
with the book.
å A large number of end-of-chapter problems, review questions, and multiple choice
questions are available to instructors to use for homework exercises and quizzes.
å Sections on Guide to Processing are included in each of the chapters on engineering
materials.
å Sections on Product Design Considerations are provided in many of the manufacturing process chapters.
å Historical Notes on many of the technologies are included throughout the book.
å The principal engineering units are System International (metric), but both metric
and U.S. Customary Units are used throughout the text.

Making things has been an essential activity of human civilizations since before recorded history. Today, the term manufacturing is used for this activity. For technological and
economic reasons, manufacturing is important to the welfare
of the United States and most other developed and developing nations. Technology can be defined as the application of
science to provide society and its members with those things
that are needed or desired. Technology affects our daily lives,
directly and indirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of
products in Table 1.1. They represent various technologies
that help society and its members to live better. What do all
these products have in common? They are all manufactured.
These technological wonders would not be available to society
if they could not be manufactured. Manufacturing is the
critical factor that makes technology possible.
Economically, manufacturing is an important means
by which a nation creates material wealth. In the United
States, the manufacturing industries account for about
15% of gross domestic product (GDP). A country’s natural
resources, such as agricultural lands, mineral deposits, and
oil reserves, also create wealth. In the U.S., agriculture,
mining, and similar industries account for less than 5% of
GDP (agriculture alone is only about 1%). Construction
and public utilities make up around 5%. The rest is service
industries, which include retail, transportation, banking,
communication, education, and government. The service
sector accounts for more than 75% of U.S. GDP. Government alone accounts for about as much of GDP as the
manufacturing sector; however, government services do
not create wealth. In the modern global economy, a nation
must have a strong manufacturing base (or it must have
significant natural resources) if it is to provide a strong
economy and a high standard of living for its people.
In this opening chapter, we consider some general
topics about manufacturing. What is manufacturing? How
is it organized in industry? What are the materials, processes, and systems by which it is accomplished?

WHAT IS MANUFACTURING?
The word manufacture is derived from two Latin words, manus (hand) and factus
(make); the combination means made by hand. The English word manufacture is several
centuries old, and ‘‘made by hand’’ accurately described the manual methods used when
the word was ﬁrst coined.1 Most modern manufacturing is accomplished by automated and
computer-controlled machinery (Historical Note 1.1).

Historical Note 1.1

T

History of manufacturing

he history of manufacturing can be separated into
two subjects: (1) human’s discovery and invention of
materials and processes to make things, and (2)
development of the systems of production. The materials
and processes to make things predate the systems by
several millennia. Some of the processes—casting,
hammering (forging), and grinding—date back 6000
years or more. The early fabrication of implements and
weapons was accomplished more as crafts and trades
than manufacturing as it is known today. The ancient
Romans had what might be called factories to produce
weapons, scrolls, pottery and glassware, and other
products of the time, but the procedures were largely
based on handicraft.
The systems aspects of manufacturing are examined
here, and the materials and processes are postponed until
Historical Note 1.2. Systems of manufacturing refer to
the ways of organizing people and equipment so that
production can be performed more efficiently. Several
historical events and discoveries stand out as having had

a major impact on the development of modern
manufacturing systems.
Certainly one significant discovery was the principle
of division of labor—dividing the total work into tasks
and having individual workers each become a specialist
at performing only one task. This principle had been
practiced for centuries, but the economist Adam Smith
(1723–1790) is credited with first explaining its
economic significance in The Wealth of Nations.
The Industrial Revolution (circa 1760–1830) had a
major impact on production in several ways. It marked
the change from an economy based on agriculture and
handicraft to one based on industry and manufacturing.
The change began in England, where a series of
machines were invented and steam power replaced
water, wind, and animal power. These advances gave
British industry significant advantages over other nations,
and England attempted to restrict export of the new
technologies. However, the revolution eventually spread
to other European countries and the United States.

1
As a noun, the word manufacture first appeared in English around 1567 AD. As a verb, it first appeared
around 1683 AD.

Section 1.1/What Is Manufacturing?

Several inventions of the Industrial Revolution greatly
contributed to the development of manufacturing: (1)
Watt’s steam engine, a new power-generating
technology for industry; (2) machine tools, starting with
John Wilkinson’s boring machine around 1775
(Historical Note 22.1); (3) the spinning jenny, power
loom, and other machinery for the textile industry
that permitted significant increases in productivity;
and (4) the factory system, a new way of organizing
large numbers of production workers based on division
of labor.
While England was leading the industrial revolution,
an important concept was being introduced in the United
States: interchangeable parts manufacture. Much credit
for this concept is given to Eli Whitney (1765–1825),
although its importance had been recognized by others
[9]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated a contract to produce
10,000 muskets for the U.S. government. The traditional
way of making guns at the time was to custom fabricate
each part for a particular gun and then hand-fit the parts
together by filing. Each musket was unique, and the time
to make it was considerable. Whitney believed that the
components could be made accurately enough to permit
parts assembly without fitting. After several years of
development in his Connecticut factory, he traveled to
Washington in 1801 to demonstrate the principle. He
laid out components for 10 muskets before government
officials, including Thomas Jefferson, and proceeded
to select parts randomly to assemble the guns. No
special filing or fitting was required, and all of the guns
worked perfectly. The secret behind his achievement
was the collection of special machines, fixtures, and
gages that he had developed in his factory.
Interchangeable parts manufacture required many
years of development before becoming a practical
reality, but it revolutionized methods of manufacturing.
It is a prerequisite for mass production. Because its
origins were in the United States, interchangeable parts
production came to be known as the American System
of manufacture.
The mid- and late 1800s witnessed the expansion of
railroads, steam-powered ships, and other machines that
created a growing need for iron and steel. New steel

3

production methods were developed to meet this
demand (Historical Note 6.1). Also during this period,
several consumer products were developed, including
the sewing machine, bicycle, and automobile. To meet
the mass demand for these products, more efficient
production methods were required. Some historians
identify developments during this period as the Second
Industrial Revolution, characterized in terms of its effects
on manufacturing systems by: (1) mass production, (2)
scientific management movement, (3) assembly lines,
and (4) electrification of factories.
In the late 1800s, the scientific management
movement was developing in the United States in
response to the need to plan and control the activities of
growing numbers of production workers. The
movement’s leaders included Frederick W. Taylor
(1856–1915), Frank Gilbreth (1868–1924), and his wife
Lilian (1878–1972). Scientific management included
several features [2]: (1) motion study, aimed at finding
the best method to perform a given task; (2) time study,
to establish work standards for a job; (3) extensive use of
standards in industry; (4) the piece rate system and
similar labor incentive plans; and (5) use of data
collection, record keeping, and cost accounting in
factory operations.
Henry Ford (1863–1947) introduced the assembly
line in 1913 at his Highland Park, MI plant. The assembly
line made possible the mass production of complex
consumer products. Use of assembly line methods
permitted Ford to sell a Model T automobile for as little
as $500, thus making ownership of cars feasible for a
large segment of the U.S. population.
In 1881, the first electric power generating station had
been built in New York City, and soon electric motors
were being used as a power source to operate factory
machinery. This was a far more convenient power
delivery system than steam engines, which required
overhead belts to distribute power to the machines. By
1920, electricity had overtaken steam as the principal
power source in U.S. factories. The twentieth century
was a time of more technological advances than in all
other centuries combined. Many of these developments
resulted in the automation of manufacturing.

1.1.1 MANUFACTURING DEFINED
As a field of study in the modern context, manufacturing can be defined two ways, one
technologic and the other economic. Technologically, manufacturing is the application of
physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/or appearance of a
given starting material to make parts or products; manufacturing also includes assembly
of multiple parts to make products. The processes to accomplish manufacturing involve a
combination of machinery, tools, power, and labor, as depicted in Figure 1.1(a).

Two ways to define manufacturing: (a) as a technical process, and (b) as an economic process.

Manufacturing is almost always carried out as a sequence of operations. Each operation
brings the material closer to the desired final state.
Economically, manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of greater
value by means of one or more processing and/or assembly operations, as depicted in
Figure 1.1(b). The key point is that manufacturing adds value to the material by changing its
shape or properties, or by combining it with other materials that have been similarly altered.
The material has been made more valuable through the manufacturing operations performed
on it. When iron ore is converted into steel, value is added. When sand is transformed into
glass, value is added. When petroleum is refined into plastic, value is added. And when plastic
is molded into the complex geometry of a patio chair, it is made even more valuable.
The words manufacturing and production are often used interchangeably. The
author’s view is that production has a broader meaning than manufacturing. To illustrate,
one might speak of ‘‘crude oil production,’’ but the phrase ‘‘crude oil manufacturing’’ seems
out of place. Yet when used in the context of products such as metal parts or automobiles,
either word seems okay.

1.1.2 MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS
Manufacturing is an important commercial activity performed by companies that sell
products to customers. The type of manufacturing done by a company depends on the
kind of product it makes. Let us explore this relationship by examining the types of
industries in manufacturing and identifying the products they make.
Manufacturing Industries Industry consists of enterprises and organizations that produce or supply goods and services. Industries can be classified as primary, secondary, or
tertiary. Primary industries cultivate and exploit natural resources, such as agriculture and
mining. Secondary industries take the outputs of the primary industries and convert them
into consumer and capital goods. Manufacturing is the principal activity in this category, but
construction and power utilities are also included. Tertiary industries constitute the service
sector of the economy. A list of specific industries in these categories is presented in Table 1.2.
This book is concerned with the secondary industries in Table 1.2, which include the
companies engaged in manufacturing. However, the International Standard Industrial
Classification (ISIC) used to compile Table 1.2 includes several industries whose
production technologies are not covered in this text; for example, beverages, chemicals,
and food processing. In this book, manufacturing means production of hardware, which
ranges from nuts and bolts to digital computers and military weapons. Plastic and ceramic

products are included, but apparel, paper, pharmaceuticals, power utilities, publishing,
and wood products are excluded.
Manufactured Products Final products made by the manufacturing industries can be
divided into two major classes: consumer goods and capital goods. Consumer goods are
products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal computers, TVs, tires,
and tennis rackets. Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce goods
and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, machine
tools, and construction equipment. Most of these capital goods are purchased by the
service industries. It was noted in the Introduction that manufacturing accounts for about
15% of GDP and services about 75% of GDP in the United States. Yet the manufactured
capital goods purchased by the service sector are the enablers of that sector. Without the
capital goods, the service industries could not function.
In addition to final products, other manufactured items include the materials,
components, and supplies used by the companies that make the final products. Examples
of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined parts, plastic
moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants. Thus, the manufacturing industries consist of a complex infrastructure with various categories and layers of
intermediate suppliers with whom the final consumer never deals.
This book is generally concerned with discrete items—individual parts and
assembled products, rather than items produced by continuous processes. A metal
stamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continuous
(almost). Many discrete parts start out as continuous or semicontinuous products, such as
extrusions and electrical wire. Long sections made in almost continuous lengths are cut to
the desired size. An oil refinery is a better example of a continuous process.
Production Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a factory
has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures are organized.
Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) low production,
quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium production, from 100 to 10,000
units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions of units. The boundaries

FIGURE 1.2 Relationship
between product variety and

between the three ranges are somewhat arbitrary (in the author’s judgment). Depending
on the kinds of products, these boundaries may shift by an order of magnitude or so.
Production quantity refers to the number of units produced annually of a particular
product type. Some plants produce a variety of different product types, each type being made
in low or medium quantities. Other plants specialize in high production of only one product
type. It is instructive to identify product variety as a parameter distinct from production
quantity. Product variety refers to different product designs or types that are produced in the
plant. Different products have different shapes and sizes; they perform different functions;
they are intended for different markets; some have more components than others; and so
forth. The number of different product types made each year can be counted. When the
number of product types made in the factory is high, this indicates high product variety.
There is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity in
terms of factory operations. If a factory’s product variety is high, then its production quantity
is likely to be low; but if production quantity is high, then product variety will be low, as
depicted in Figure 1.2. Manufacturing plants tend to specialize in a combination of production
quantity and product variety that lies somewhere inside the diagonal band in Figure 1.2.
Although product variety has been identified as a quantitative parameter (the number
of different product types made by the plant or company), this parameter is much less exact
than production quantity, because details on how much the designs differ are not captured
simply by the number of different designs. Differences between an automobile and an air
conditioner are far greater than between an air conditioner and a heat pump. Within each
product type, there are differences among specific models.
The extent of the product differences may be small or great, as illustrated in the
automotive industry. Each of the U.S. automotive companies produces cars with two or
three different nameplates in the same assembly plant, although the body styles and other
design features are virtually the same. In different plants, the company builds heavy trucks.
The terms ‘‘soft’’ and ‘‘hard’’ might be used to describe these differences in product variety.
Soft product variety occurs when there are only small differences among products, such as
the differences among car models made on the same production line. In an assembled
product, soft variety is characterized by a high proportion of common parts among the
models. Hard product variety occurs when the products differ substantially, and there are
few common parts, if any. The difference between a car and a truck exemplifies hard variety.

1.1.3 MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY
A manufacturing plant consists of a set of processes and systems (and people, of course)
designed to transform a certain limited range of materials into products of increased
value. These three building blocks—materials, processes, and systems—constitute the

E1C01

Section 1.2/Materials in Manufacturing

subject of modern manufacturing. There is a strong interdependence among these
factors. A company engaged in manufacturing cannot do everything. It must do only
certain things, and it must do those things well. Manufacturing capability refers to the
technical and physical limitations of a manufacturing firm and each of its plants. Several
dimensions of this capability can be identified: (1) technological processing capability, (2)
physical size and weight of product, and (3) production capacity.
Technological Processing Capability The technological processing capability of a
plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants perform
machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build automobiles. A machine shop cannot roll steel, and a rolling mill cannot build cars. The underlying
feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can perform. Technological
processing capability is closely related to material type. Certain manufacturing processes
are suited to certain materials, whereas other processes are suited to other materials. By
specializing in a certain process or group of processes, the plant is simultaneously
specializing in certain material types. Technological processing capability includes not
only the physical processes, but also the expertise possessed by plant personnel in these
processing technologies. Companies must concentrate on the design and manufacture of
products that are compatible with their technological processing capability.
Physical Product Limitations A second aspect of manufacturing capability is imposed by
the physical product. A plant with a given set of processes is limited in terms of the size and
weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large, heavy products are difficult to
move. To move these products about, the plant must be equipped with cranes of the required
load capacity. Smaller parts and products made in large quantities can be moved by conveyor
or other means. The limitation on product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of
the manufacturing equipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger
machines must be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling
equipment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range.
Production Capacity A third limitation on a plant’s manufacturing capability is the
production quantity that can be produced in a given time period (e.g., month or year). This
quantity limitation is commonly called plant capacity, or production capacity, defined as
the maximum rate of production that a plant can achieve under assumed operating
conditions. The operating conditions refer to number of shifts per week, hours per shift,
direct labor manning levels in the plant, and so on. These factors represent inputs to the
manufacturing plant. Given these inputs, how much output can the factory produce?
Plant capacity is usually measured in terms of output units, such as annual tons of
steel produced by a steel mill, or number of cars produced by a final assembly plant. In
these cases, the outputs are homogeneous. In cases in which the output units are not
homogeneous, other factors may be more appropriate measures, such as available labor
hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of parts.
Materials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of manufacturing and
the three broad subject areas of this book. This introductory chapter provides an overview
of these three subjects before embarking on detailed coverage in the remaining chapters.

1.2

MATERIALS IN MANUFACTURING
Most engineering materials can be classified into one of three basic categories:(1) metals, (2)
ceramics, and (3) polymers.Their chemistries are different, their mechanical and physical
properties are different, and these differences affect the manufacturing processes that can
be used to produce products from them. In addition to the three basic categories, there are

(4) composites—nonhomogeneous mixtures of the other three basic types rather than a
unique category. The classification of the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.3. This section
surveys these materials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail.

1.2.1 METALS
Metals used in manufacturing are usually alloys, which are composed of two or more
elements, with at least one being a metallic element. Metals and alloys can be divided into
two basic groups: (1) ferrous and (2) nonferrous.
Ferrous Metals Ferrous metals are based on iron; the group includes steel and cast iron.
These metals constitute the most important group commercially, more than three fourths of
the metal tonnage throughout the world. Pure iron has limited commercial use, but when
alloyed with carbon, iron has more uses and greater commercial value than any other metal.
Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron.
Steel can be defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It is the
most important category within the ferrous metal group. Its composition often includes other
alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel,and molybdenum, to enhance
the properties of the metal. Applications of steel include construction (bridges, I-beams, and

E1C01

Section 1.2/Materials in Manufacturing

nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling stock for railroads), and consumer products
(automobiles and appliances).
Cast iron is an alloy of iron and carbon (2% to 4%) used in casting (primarily sand
casting). Silicon is also present in the alloy (in amounts from 0.5% to 3%), and other
elements are often added also, to obtain desirable properties in the cast part. Cast iron is
available in several different forms, of which gray cast iron is the most common; its
applications include blocks and heads for internal combustion engines.
Nonferrous Metals Nonferrous metals include the other metallic elements and their
alloys. In almost all cases, the alloys are more important commercially than the pure metals.
The nonferrous metals include the pure metals and alloys of aluminum, copper, gold,
magnesium, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc, and other metals.

1.2.2 CERAMICS
A ceramic is defined as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonmetallic
elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceramics include a
variety of traditional and modern materials. Traditional ceramics, some of which have been
used for thousands of years, include: clay (abundantly available, consisting of fine particles of
hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals used in making brick, tile, and pottery); silica
(the basis for nearly all glass products); and alumina and silicon carbide (two abrasive
materials used in grinding). Modern ceramics include some of the preceding materials, such as
alumina, whose properties are enhanced in various ways through modern processing methods.
Newer ceramics include: carbides—metal carbides such as tungsten carbide and titanium
carbide, which are widely used as cutting tool materials; and nitrides—metal and semimetal
nitrides such as titanium nitride and boron nitride, used as cutting tools and grinding abrasives.
For processing purposes, ceramics can be divided into crystalline ceramics and glasses.
Different methods of manufacturing are required for the two types. Crystalline ceramics are
formed in various ways from powders and then fired (heated to a temperature below the
melting point to achieve bonding between the powders). The glass ceramics (namely, glass)
can be melted and cast, and then formed in processes such as traditional glass blowing.

1.2.3 POLYMERS
A polymer is a compound formed of repeating structural units called mers, whose atoms
share electrons to form very large molecules. Polymers usually consist of carbon plus one
or more other elements, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine. Polymers are
divided into three categories: (1) thermoplastic polymers, (2) thermosetting polymers,
and (3) elastomers.
Thermoplasticpolymerscan besubjected tomultipleheatingand coolingcycles without
substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Common thermoplastics include
polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and nylon. Thermosetting polymers chemically
transform (cure) into a rigid structure on cooling from a heated plastic condition; hence the
name thermosetting. Members of this type include phenolics, amino resins, and epoxies.
Although the name thermosetting is used, some of these polymers cure by mechanisms other
than heating. Elastomers are polymers that exhibit significant elastic behavior; hence the
name elastomer. They include natural rubber, neoprene, silicone, and polyurethane.

1.2.4 COMPOSITES
Composites do not really constitute a separate category of materials; they are mixtures of the
other three types. A composite is a material consisting of two or more phases that are

E1C01

11/11/2009

10

13:31:34

Page 10

Chapter 1/Introduction and Overview of Manufacturing

processed separately and then bonded together to achieve properties superior to those of its
constituents. The term phase refers to a homogeneous mass of material, such as an
aggregation of grains of identical unit cell structure in a solid metal. The usual structure
of a composite consists of particles or fibers of one phase mixed in a second phase, called the
matrix.
Composites are found in nature (e.g., wood), and they can be produced synthetically.
The synthesized type is of greater interest here, and it includes glass fibers in a polymer
matrix, such as fiber-reinforced plastic; polymer fibers of one type in a matrix of a second
polymer, such as an epoxy-Kevlar composite; and ceramic in a metal matrix, such as a
tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder to form a cemented carbide cutting tool.
Properties of a composite depend on its components, the physical shapes of the
components, and the way they are combined to form the final material. Some composites
combine high strength with light weight and are suited to applications such as aircraft
components, car bodies, boat hulls, tennis rackets, and fishing rods. Other composites are
strong, hard, and capable of maintaining these properties at elevated temperatures, for
example, cemented carbide cutting tools.

1.3

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
A manufacturing process is a designed procedure that results in physical and/or chemical
changes to a starting work material with the intention of increasing the value of that material.
A manufacturing process is usually carried out as a unit operation , which means that it is a
single step in the sequence of steps required to transform the starting material into a final
product. Manufacturing operations can be divided into two basic types: (1) processing
operations and (2) assembly operations. A processing operation transforms a work
material from one state of completion to a more advanced state that is closer to the
final desired product. It adds value by changing the geometry, properties, or appearance of
the starting material. In general, processing operations are performed on discrete workparts, but certain processing operations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g.,
painting a spot-welded car body). An assembly operation joins two or more components
to create a new entity, called an assembly, subassembly, or some other term that refers to
the joining process (e.g., a welded assembly is called a weldment). A classification of
manufacturing processes is presented in Figure 1.4. Many of the manufacturing processes
covered in this text can be viewed on the DVD that comes with this book. Alerts are
provided on these video clips throughout the text. Some of the basic processes used in
modern manufacturing date from antiquity (Historical Note 1.2).

1.3.1 PROCESSING OPERATIONS
A processing operation uses energy to alter a workpart’s shape, physical properties, or
appearance to add value to the material. The forms of energy include mechanical, thermal,
electrical, and chemical. The energy is applied in a controlled way by means of machinery
and tooling. Human energy may also be required, but the human workers are generally
employed to control the machines, oversee the operations, and load and unload parts before
and after each cycle of operation. A general model of a processing operation is illustrated in
Figure 1.1(a). Material is fed into the process, energy is applied by the machinery and tooling
to transform the material, and the completed workpart exits the process. Most production
operations produce waste or scrap, either as a natural aspect of the process (e.g., removing
material, as in machining) or in the form of occasional defective pieces. It is an important
objective in manufacturing to reduce waste in either of these forms.

Manufacturing materials and processes

lthough most of the historical developments that form
the modern practice of manufacturing have occurred
only during the last few centuries (Historical Note 1.1),
several of the basic fabrication processes date as far back
as the Neolithic period (circa 8000–3000 BCE.). It was
during this period that processes such as the following
were developed: carving and other woodworking, hand
forming and firing of clay pottery, grinding and polishing
of stone, spinning and weaving of textiles, and dyeing of
cloth.
Metallurgy and metalworking also began during the
Neolithic period, in Mesopotamia and other areas
around the Mediterranean. It either spread to, or
developed independently in, regions of Europe and Asia.
Gold was found by early humans in relatively pure form
in nature; it could be hammered into shape. Copper was
probably the first metal to be extracted from ores, thus
requiring smelting as a processing technique. Copper
could not be hammered readily because it strain
hardened; instead, it was shaped by casting (Historical

Note 10.1). Other metals used during this period were
silver and tin. It was discovered that copper alloyed with
tin produced a more workable metal than copper alone
(casting and hammering could both be used). This
heralded the important period known as the Bronze Age
(circa 3500–1500 BCE.).
Iron was also first smelted during the Bronze Age.
Meteorites may have been one source of the metal,
but iron ore was also mined. Temperatures required
to reduce iron ore to metal are significantly higher
than for copper, which made furnace operations more
difficult. Other processing methods were also more
difficult for the same reason. Early blacksmiths
learned that when certain irons (those containing
small amounts of carbon) were sufficiently heated and
then quenched, they became very hard. This
permitted grinding a very sharp cutting edge on
knives and weapons, but it also made the metal
brittle. Toughness could be increased by reheating at
a lower temperature, a process known as tempering.

What we have described is, of course, the heat
treatment of steel. The superior properties of steel
caused it to succeed bronze in many applications
(weaponry, agriculture, and mechanical devices). The
period of its use has subsequently been named the
Iron Age (starting around 1000 BCE.). It was not until
much later, well into the nineteenth century, that the
demand for steel grew significantly and more modern
steelmaking techniques were developed (Historical
Note 6.1).
The beginnings of machine tool technology
occurred during the Industrial Revolution. During the
period 1770–1850, machine tools were developed for
most of the conventional material removal processes,
such as boring, turning, drilling, milling, shaping,
and planing (Historical Note 22.1). Many of the
individual processes predate the machine tools by
centuries; for example, drilling and sawing (of wood)
date from ancient times, and turning (of wood) from
around the time of Christ.
Assembly methods were used in ancient cultures to
make ships, weapons, tools, farm implements,
machinery, chariots and carts, furniture, and garments.
The earliest processes included binding with twine and
rope, riveting and nailing, and soldering. Around 2000
years ago, forge welding and adhesive bonding were
developed. Widespread use of screws, bolts, and nuts as

fasteners—so common in today’s assembly—required
the development of machine tools that could accurately
cut the required helical shapes (e.g., Maudsley’s screw
cutting lathe, 1800). It was not until around 1900 that
fusion welding processes started to be developed as
assembly techniques (Historical Note 29.1).
Natural rubber was the first polymer to be used in
manufacturing (if we overlook wood, which is a polymer
composite). The vulcanization process, discovered by
Charles Goodyear in 1839, made rubber a useful
engineering material (Historical Note 8.2). Subsequent
developments included plastics such as cellulose nitrate
in 1870, Bakelite in 1900, polyvinylchloride in 1927,
polyethylene in 1932, and nylon in the late 1930s
(Historical Note 8.1). Processing requirements for
plastics led to the development of injection molding
(based on die casting, one of the metal casting processes)
and other polymer-shaping techniques.
Electronics products have imposed unusual demands
on manufacturing in terms of miniaturization. The
evolution of the technology has been to package more
and more devices into smaller and smaller areas—in
some cases millions of transistors onto a flat piece of
semiconductor material that is only 12 mm (0.50 in.) on
a side. The history of electronics processing and
packaging dates from only a few decades (Historical
Notes 34.1, 35.1, and 35.2).

More than one processing operation is usually required to transform the starting
material into final form. The operations are performed in the particular sequence
required to achieve the geometry and condition defined by the design specification.
Three categories of processing operations are distinguished: (1) shaping operations, (2)
property-enhancing operations, and (3) surface processing operations. Shaping operations
alter the geometry of the starting work material by various methods. Common shaping
processes include casting, forging, and machining. Property-enhancing operations add
value to the material by improving its physical properties without changing its shape. Heat
treatment is the most common example. Surface processing operations are performed to
clean, treat, coat, or deposit material onto the exterior surface of the work. Common
examples of coating are plating and painting. Shaping processes are covered in Parts III
through VI, corresponding to the four main categories of shaping processes in Figure 1.4.
Property-enhancing processes and surface processing operations are covered in Part VII.
Shaping Processes Most shape processing operations apply heat, mechanical force, or
a combination of these to effect a change in geometry of the work material. There are
various ways to classify the shaping processes. The classification used in this book is based
on the state of the starting material, by which we have four categories: (1) solidification
processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semifluid that cools and
solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which the starting
material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the desired geometry;
(3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a ductile solid (commonly
metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material removal processes, in which

FIGURE 1.5 Casting
and molding processes
start with a work material
heated to a fluid or
semifluid state. The
process consists of:
(1) pouring the fluid into a
mold cavity and (2)
allowing the fluid to
solidify, after which the
solid part is removed
from the mold.

the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from which material is removed so that
the resulting part has the desired geometry.
In the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into a
liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state. Nearly all materials can be processed in this way.
Metals, ceramic glasses, and plastics can all be heated to sufficiently high temperatures to
convert them into liquids. With the material in a liquid or semifluid form, it can be poured or
otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to solidify, thus taking a solid shape
that is the same as the cavity. Most processes that operate this way are called casting or
molding. Casting is the name used for metals, and molding is the common term used for
plastics. This category of shaping process is depicted in Figure 1.5.
In particulate processing, the starting materials are powders of metals or ceramics.
Although these two materials are quite different, the processes to shape them in particulate
processing are quite similar. The common technique involves pressing and sintering,
illustrated in Figure 1.6, in which the powders are first squeezed into a die cavity under
high pressure and then heated to bond the individual particles together.
In deformation processes, the starting workpart is shaped by the application of forces
that exceed the yield strength of the material. For the material to be formed in this way, it
must be sufficiently ductile to avoid fracture during deformation. To increase ductility (and
for other reasons), the work material is often heated before forming to a temperature below
the melting point. Deformation processes are associated most closely with metalworking
and include operations such as forging and extrusion, shown in Figure 1.7.

FIGURE 1.7 Some
common deformation
processes: (a) forging, in
which two halves of a die
squeeze the workpart,
causing it to assume the
shape of the die cavity;
and (b) extrusion, in
which a billet is forced to
flow through a die orifice,
thus taking the crosssectional shape of the
orifice.

Materialremovalprocessesareoperations thatremoveexcessmaterialfromthestarting
workpiece so that the resulting shape is the desired geometry. The most important processes in
this category are machining operations such as turning, drilling, and milling, shown in
Figure 1.8. These cutting operations are most commonly applied to solid metals, performed
using cutting tools that are harder and stronger than the work metal. Grinding is another
common process in this category. Other material removal processes are known as nontraditional processes because they use lasers, electron beams, chemical erosion, electric
discharges,andelectrochemicalenergytoremovematerialratherthancuttingorgrindingtools.
It is desirable to minimize waste and scrap in converting a starting workpart into its
subsequent geometry. Certain shaping processes are more efficient than others in terms of
material conservation. Material removal processes (e.g., machining) tend to be wasteful of
material, simply by the way they work. The material removed from the starting shape is waste,
at least in terms of the unit operation. Other processes, such as certain casting and molding
operations, often convert close to 100% of the starting material into final product. Manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of the starting material into product and require
no subsequent machining to achieve final part geometry are called net shape processes. Other
processes require minimum machining to produce the final shape and are called near net shape
processes.
Property-Enhancing Processes The second major type of part processing is performed
to improve mechanical or physical properties of the work material. These processes do not
alter the shape of the part, except unintentionally in some cases. The most important
property-enhancing processes involve heat treatments, which include various annealing

and strengthening processes for metals and glasses. Sintering of powdered metals and
ceramics is also a heat treatment that strengthens a pressed powder metal workpart.
Surface Processing Surface processing operations include (1) cleaning, (2) surface treatments, and (3) coating and thin film deposition processes. Cleaning includes both chemical and
mechanical processes to remove dirt, oil, and other contaminants from the surface. Surface
treatments include mechanical working such as shot peening and sand blasting, and physical
processes such as diffusion and ion implantation. Coating and thin film deposition processes
apply a coating of material to the exterior surface of the workpart. Common coating processes
include electroplating, anodizing of aluminum, organic coating (call it painting), and
porcelain enameling. Thin film deposition processes include physical vapor deposition and
chemical vapor deposition to form extremely thin coatings of various substances.
Several surface-processing operations have been adapted to fabricate semiconductor materials into integrated circuits for microelectronics. These processes include
chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and oxidation. They are applied to
very localized areas on the surface of a thin wafer of silicon (or other semiconductor
material) to create the microscopic circuit.

1.3.2 ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS
The second basic type of manufacturing operation is assembly, in which two or more separate
parts are joined to form a new entity. Components of the new entity are connected either
permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes include welding, brazing,
soldering, and adhesive bonding. They form a joint between components that cannot be easily
disconnected. Certain mechanical assembly methods are available to fasten two (or more)
parts together in a joint that can be conveniently disassembled. The use of screws, bolts, and
other threaded fasteners are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical
assembly techniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets, press fitting,and
expansion fits. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly of electronic
products.Someofthemethods areidenticaltoorareadaptations oftheprecedingprocesses,for
example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned primarily with the assembly of components such as integrated circuit packages to printed circuit boards to produce the complex
circuits used in so many of today’s products. Joining and assembly processes are discussed in
Part VIII, and the specialized assembly techniques for electronics are described in Part IX.

1.3.3 PRODUCTION MACHINES AND TOOLING
Manufacturing operations are accomplished using machinery and tooling (and people). The
extensive use of machinery in manufacturing began with the Industrial Revolution. It was at
that time that metal cutting machines started to be developed and widely used. These were
called machine tools—power-driven machines used to operate cutting tools previously
operated by hand. Modern machine tools are described by the same basic definition, except
that the power is electrical rather than water or steam, and the level of precision and
automation is much greater today. Machine tools are among the most versatile of all
production machines. They are used to make not only parts for consumer products, but
also components for other production machines. Both in a historic and a reproductive sense,
the machine tool is the mother of all machinery.
Other production machines include presses for stamping operations, forge hammers
for forging, rolling mills for rolling sheet metal, welding machines for welding, and insertion
machines for inserting electronic components into printed circuit boards. The name of the
equipment usually follows from the name of the process.

Various types of casting setups and equipment (Chapter 11).

Production equipment can be general purpose or special purpose. General purpose
equipment is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially available for
any manufacturing company to invest in. Special purpose equipment is usually designed to
produce a specific part or product in very large quantities. The economics of mass production
justify large investments in special purpose machinery to achieve high efficiencies and short
cycle times. This is not the only reason for special purpose equipment, but it is the dominant
one. Another reason may be because the process is unique and commercial equipment is not
available. Some companies with unique processing requirements develop their own special
purpose equipment.
Production machinery usually requires tooling that customizes the equipment for the
particular part or product. In many cases, the tooling must be designed specifically for the part
or product configuration. When used with general purpose equipment, it is designed to be
exchanged. For each workpart type, the tooling is fastened to the machine and the production
run is made. When the run is completed, the tooling is changed for the next workpart type.
When used with special purpose machines, the tooling is often designed as an integral part of
the machine. Because the special purposemachine is likely being used for mass production, the
tooling may never need changing except for replacement of worn components or for repair of
worn surfaces.
The type of tooling depends on the type of manufacturing process. Table 1.3 lists
examples of special tooling used in various operations. Details are provided in the chapters
that discuss these processes.

1.4

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
To operate effectively, a manufacturing firm must have systems that allow it to efficiently
accomplish its type of production. Production systems consist of people, equipment, and
procedures designed for the combination of materials and processes that constitute a firm’s
manufacturing operations. Production systems can be divided into two categories: (1)
production facilities and (2) manufacturing support systems, as shown in Figure 1.10.
Production facilities refer to the physical equipment and the arrangement of equipment
in the factory. Manufacturing support systems are the procedures used by the company to
manage production and solve the technical and logistics problems encountered in ordering materials, moving work through the factory, and ensuring that products meet quality

E1C01

Section 1.4/Production Systems

17

standards. Both categories include people. People make these systems work. In general,
direct labor workers are responsible for operating the manufacturing equipment; and
professional staff workers are responsible for manufacturing support.

1.4.1 PRODUCTION FACILITIES
Production facilities consist of the factory and the production, material handling, and
other equipment in the factory. The equipment comes in direct physical contact with
the parts and/or assemblies as they are being made. The facilities ‘‘touch’’ the product.
Facilities also include the way the equipment is arranged in the factory—the plant layout. The
equipment is usually organized into logical groupings; which can be called manufacturing
systems, such as an automated production line, or a machine cell consisting of an
industrial robot and two machine tools.
A manufacturing company attempts to design its manufacturing systems and organize its factories to serve the particular mission of each plant in the most efficient way. Over
the years, certain types of production facilities have come to be recognized as the most
appropriate way to organize for a given combination of product variety and production
quantity, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. Different types of facilities are required for each of
the three ranges of annual production quantities.
Low-Quantity Production In the low-quantity range (1–100 units/year), the term job
shop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low
quantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically complex, such
as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The equipment in a job shop is
general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled.
A job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide product
variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, and therefore
difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fabrication or assembly.
Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, rather than moving the
product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to as a fixed-position layout, shown
in Figure 1.9(a). In a pure situation, the product remains in a single location during its entire
production. Examples of such products include ships, aircraft, locomotives, and heavy machinery. In actual practice, these items are usually built in large modules at single locations, and then
the completed modules are brought together for final assembly using large-capacity cranes.
The individual components of these large products are often made in factories in which
the equipment is arranged according to function or type. This arrangement is called a process
layout. The lathes are in one department, the milling machines are in another department,
and so on, as in Figure 1.9(b). Different parts, each requiring a different operation sequence,
are routed through the departments in the particular order needed for their processing,
usually in batches. The process layout is noted for its flexibility; it can accommodate a great
variety of operation sequences for different part configurations. Its disadvantage is that the
machinery and methods to produce a part are not designed for high efficiency.
Medium Quantity Production In the medium-quantity range (100–10,000 units annually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product variety. When
productvarietyis hard, theusual approach is batchproduction, inwhich abatch of one product
is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is changed over to produce a batch of the
next product, and so on. The production rate of the equipment is greater than the demand rate
foranysingleproducttype,andsothesameequipmentcanbesharedamongmultipleproducts.
The changeover between production runs takes time—time to change tooling and set up the
machinery. This setup time is lost production time, and this is a disadvantage of batch
manufacturing. Batch production is commonly used for make-to-stock situations, in which

items are manufactured to replenish inventory that has been gradually depleted by demand.
The equipment is usually arranged in a process layout, as in Figure 1.9(b).
An alternative approach to medium-range production is possible if product variety is
soft. In this case, extensive changeovers between one product style and the next may not be
necessary. It is often possible to configure the manufacturing system so that groups of similar
products can be made on the same equipment without significant lost time because of setup.
The processing or assembly of different parts or products is accomplished in cells consisting of
several workstations or machines. The term cellular manufacturing is often associated with
this type of production. Each cell is designed to produce a limited variety of part configurations; that is, the cell specializes in the production of a given set of similar parts, according to
the principles of group technology (Section 39.5). The layout is called a cellular layout,
depicted in Figure 1.9(c).
High Production The high-quantity range (10,000 to millions of units per year) is referred
to as mass production. The situation is characterized by a high demand rate for the product,
and the manufacturing system is dedicated to the production of that single item. Two
categories of mass production can be distinguished: quantity production and flow line
production. Quantity production involves the mass production of single parts on single
pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines (e.g., stamping presses)
equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling devices), in effect dedicating
the equipment to the production of one part type. Typical layouts used in quantity production
are the process layout and cellular layout.
Flow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations arranged
in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to complete the
product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for the product to
maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the workstations are arranged

19

into one long line, as in Figure 1.9(d), or into a series of connected line segments. The work is
usually moved between stations by mechanized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of
the total work is completed on each unit of product.
The most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associated
with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line production
occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every product is
identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To successfully
market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and model variations so
that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that appeals to them. From a
production viewpoint, the feature differences represent a case of soft product variety. The
term mixed-model production line applies to situations in which there is soft variety in
the products made on the line. Modern automobile assembly is an example. Cars coming off
the assembly line have variations in options and trim representing different models and in
many cases different nameplates of the same basic car design.

1.4.2 MANUFACTURING SUPPORT SYSTEMS
To operate its facilities efficiently, a company must organize itself to design the processes
and equipment, plan and control the production orders, and satisfy product quality
requirements. These functions are accomplished by manufacturing support systems—
people and procedures by which a company manages its production operations. Most of
these support systems do not directly contact the product, but they plan and control its
progress through the factory. Manufacturing support functions are often carried out in the
firm by people organized into departments such as the following:
å Manufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is responsible for planning the manufacturing processes—deciding what processes should be used
to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is also involved in
designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment used by the operating
departments to accomplish processing and assembly.
å Production planning and control. This department is responsible for solving the
logistics problem in manufacturing—ordering materials and purchased parts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments have the necessary
capacity to meet the production schedules.
å Quality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any
manufacturing firm in today’s competitive environment. It means designing and

building products that conform to specifications and satisfy or exceed customer
expectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department.

1.5

TRENDS IN MANUFACTURING
This section considers several trends that are affecting the materials, processes, and systems
used in manufacturing. These trends are motivated by technological and economic factors
occurring throughout the world. Their effects are not limited to manufacturing; they impact
society as a whole. The discussion is organized into the following topic areas: (1) lean
production and Six Sigma, (2) globalization, (3) environmentally conscious manufacturing, and (4) microfabrication and nanotechnology.

1.5.1 LEAN PRODUCTION AND SIX SIGMA
These are two programs aimed at improving efficiency and quality in manufacturing. They
address the demands by customers for the products they buy to be both low in cost and high
in quality. The reason why lean and Six Sigma are trends is because they are being so widely
adopted by companies, especially in the United States.
Lean production is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Toyota
Motors in Japan. Its origins date from the 1950s, when Toyota began using unconventional
methods to improve quality, reduce inventories, and increase flexibility in its operations. Lean
production can be defined simply as ‘‘doing more work with fewer resources.’’2 It means that
fewer workers and less equipment are used to accomplish more production in less time, and
yet achieve higher quality in the final product. The underlying objective of lean production is
the elimination of waste. In the Toyota Production System, the seven forms of waste in
production are (1) production of defective parts, (2) production of more parts than required,
(3) excessive inventories, (4) unnecessary processing steps, (5) unnecessary movement of
workers, (6) unnecessary movement and handling of materials, and (7) workers waiting. The
methods used by Toyota to reduce waste include techniques for preventing errors, stopping a
process when something goes wrong, improved equipment maintenance, involving workers
in process improvements (so-called continuous improvement), and standardized work
procedures. Probably the most important development was the just-in-time delivery system,
which is described in Section 41.4 in the chapter on production and inventory control.
Six Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. The
objective was to reduce variability in the company’s processes and products to increase
customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma can be defined as ‘‘a quality-focused program that
utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an organization’s
operational performance.’’3 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in Section 42.4.2.

1.5.2 GLOBALIZATION AND OUTSOURCING
The world is becoming more and more integrated, creating an international economy in which
barriers once established by national boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has
enabled a freer flow of goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and
countries. Globalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late
1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once underdeveloped

term lean production was coined by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied
the production operations at Toyota and other automobile companies in the 1980s.

nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufacturing infrastructures
and technologies to a point where they are now important producers in the global economy.
The advantages of these three countries in particular are their large populations (therefore,
largeworkforcepool)andlowlaborcosts.Hourlywages arecurrentlyan order ofmagnitudeor
more higher in the United States than in these countries, making it difficult for domestic U.S.
companies to compete in many products requiring a high labor content. Examples include
garments, furniture, many types of toys, and electronic gear. The result has been a loss of
manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to these countries.
Globalization is closely related to outsourcing. In manufacturing, outsourcing refers
to the use of outside contractors to perform work that was traditionally accomplished inhouse. Outsourcing can be done in several ways, including the use of local suppliers. In this
case the jobs remain in the United States. Alternatively, U.S. companies can outsource to
foreign countries, so that parts and products once made in the United States are now made
outside the country. In this case U.S. jobs are displaced. Two possibilities can be distinguished: (1) offshore outsourcing, which refers to production in China or other overseas
locations and transporting the items by cargo ship to the United States, and (2) near-shore
outsourcing, which means the items are made in Canada, Mexico, or Central America and
shipped by rail or truck into the United States.
China is a country of particular interest in this discussion of globalization because of
its fast-growing economy, the importance of manufacturing in that economy, and the extent
to which U.S. companies have outsourced work to China. To take advantage of the low labor
rates, U.S. companies have outsourced much of their production to China (and other east
Asian countries). Despite the logistics problems and costs of shipping the goods back into
the United States, the result has been lower costs and higher profits for the outsourcing
companies, as well as lower prices and a wider variety of available products for U.S.
consumers. The downside has been the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs in the United
States. Another consequence of U.S. outsourcing to China has been a reduction in the
relative contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. In the 1990s, the manufacturing
industries accounted for about 20% of GDP in the United States. Today that contribution is
less than 15%. At the same time, the manufacturing sector in China has grown (along with
the rest of its economy), now accounting for almost 35% of Chinese GDP. Because the U.S.
GDP is roughly three times China’s, the United States’ manufacturing sector is still larger.
However, China is the world leader in several industries. Its tonnage output of steel is
greater than the combined outputs of the next six largest steel producing nations (in order,
Japan, United States, Russia, India, South Korea, and Germany).4 China is also the largest
producer of metal castings, accounting for more tonnage than the next three largest
producers (in order, United States, Japan, and India) [5].
Steel production and casting are considered ‘‘dirty’’ industries, and environmental
pollution is an issue not only in China, but in many places throughout the World. This issue
is addressed in the next trend.

1.5.3 ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS MANUFACTURING
An inherent feature of virtually all manufacturing processes is waste (Section 1.3.1). The most
obvious examples are material removal processes, in which chips are removed from a starting
workpiece to create the desired part geometry. Waste in one form or another is a by-product
of nearly all production operations. Another unavoidable aspect of manufacturing is that
power is required to accomplish any given process. Generating that power requires fossil fuels
(at least in the United States and China), the burning of which results in pollution of the
environment. At the end of the manufacturing sequence, a product is created that is sold to a

customer. Ultimately, the product wears out and is disposed of, perhaps in some landfill, with
the associated environmental degradation. More and more attention is being paid by society
to the environmental impact of human activities throughout the world and how modern
civilization is using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate. Global warming is
presently a major concern. The manufacturing industries contribute to these problems.
Environmentally conscious manufacturing refers to programs that seek to determine the most efficient use of materials and natural resources in production, and minimize
the negative consequences on the environment. Other associated terms for these programs
include green manufacturing, cleaner production, and sustainable manufacturing. They all
boil down to two basic approaches: (1) design products that minimize their environmental
impact, and (2) design processes that are environmentally friendly.
Product design is the logical starting point in environmentally conscious manufacturing. The term design for environment (DFE) is sometimes used for the techniques that
attempt to consider environmental impact during product design prior to production.
Considerations in DFE include the following: (1) select materials that require minimum
energy to produce, (2) select processes that minimize waste of materials and energy, (3)
design parts that can be recycled or reused, (4) design products that can be readily
disassembled to recover the parts, (5) design products that minimize the use of hazardous
and toxic materials, and (6) give attention to how the product will be disposed of at the
end of its useful life.
To a great degree, decisions made during design dictate the materials and processes that
are used to make the product. These decisions limit the options available to the manufacturing departments to achieve sustainability. However, various approaches can be applied to
make plant operations more environmentally friendly. They include the following: (1) adopt
good housekeeping practices—keep the factory clean, (2) prevent pollutants from
escaping into the environment (rivers and atmosphere), (3) minimize waste of materials
in unit operations, (4) recycle rather than discard waste materials, (5) use net shape
processes, (6) use renewable energy sources when feasible, (7) provide maintenance to
production equipment so that it operates at maximum efficiency, and (8) invest in
equipment that minimizes power requirements.
Various topics related to environmentally conscious manufacturing are discussed in
the text. The topics of polymer recycling and biodegradable plastics are covered in
Section 8.5. Cutting fluid filtration and dry machining, which reduce the adverse effects of
contaminated cutting fluids, are considered in Section 23.4.2.

1.5.4 MICROFABRICATION AND NANOTECHNOLOGY
Another trend in manufacturingistheemergenceof materialsand products whosedimensions
are sometimes so small that they cannot be seen by the naked eye. In extreme cases, the items
cannot even be seen under an optical microscope. Products that are so miniaturized require
special fabrication technologies. Microfabrication refers to the processes needed to make
parts and products whose features sizes are in the micrometer range 1 mm ¼ 103 mm ¼
106 mÞ. Examples include ink-jet printing heads, compact discs (CDs and DVDs), and
microsensors used in automotive applications (e.g., air-bag deployment sensors). Nanotechnology refers to materials and products whose feature sizes are in the nanometer
scale 1 nm ¼ 103 mm ¼ 106 mm ¼ 109 m , a scale that approaches the size of atoms
and molecules. Ultra-thin coatingsfor catalytic converters, flatscreen TVmonitors,and cancer
drugs are examples of products based on nanotechnology. Microscopic and nanoscopic
materials and products are expected to increase in importance in the future, both technologically and economically, and processes are needed to produce them commercially. The purpose
here is to make the reader aware of this trend toward miniaturization. Chapters 36 and 37 are
devoted to these technologies.

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK
The preceding sections provide an overview of the book. The remaining 41 chapters are
organized into 11 parts. The block diagram in previous Figure 1.10 summarizes the major topics
that are covered. It shows the production system (outlined in dashed lines) with engineering
materials entering from the left and finished products exiting at the right. Part I, Material
Properties and Product Attributes, consists of four chapters that describe the important
characteristics and specifications of materials and the products made from them. Part II
discusses the four basic engineering materials: metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites.
The largest block in Figure 1.10 is labeled ‘‘Manufacturing processes and assembly
operations.’’ The processes and operations included in the text are those identified in
Figure 1.4. Part III begins the coverage of the four categories of shaping processes. Part
III consists of six chapters on the solidification processes that include casting of metals,
glassworking, and polymer shaping. In Part IV, the particulate processing of metals and
ceramics is covered in two chapters. Part V deals with metal deformation processes such
as rolling, forging, extrusion, and sheet metalworking. Finally, Part VI discusses the
material removal processes. Four chapters are devoted to machining, and two chapters
cover grinding (and related abrasive processes) and the nontraditional material removal
technologies.
The other types of processing operations, property enhancing and surface processing, are covered in two chapters in Part VII. Property enhancing is accomplished by heat
treatment, and surface processing includes operations such as cleaning, electroplating,
and coating (painting).
Joining and assembly processes are considered in Part VIII, which is organized into
four chapters on welding, brazing, soldering, adhesive bonding, and mechanical assembly.
Several unique processes that do not neatly fit into the classification scheme of
Figure 1.4 are covered in Part IX, Special Processing and Assembly Technologies. Its five
chapters cover rapid prototyping, processing of integrated circuits, electronics, microfabrication, and nanofabrication.
The remaining blocks in Figure 1.10 deal with the systems of production. Part X,
‘‘Manufacturing Systems,’’ covers the major systems technologies and equipment groupings located in the factory: numerical control, industrial robotics, group technology, cellular
manufacturing, flexible manufacturing systems, and production lines. Finally, Part XI deals
with manufacturing support systems: manufacturing engineering, production planning and
control, and quality control and inspection.

An understanding of materials is fundamental in the study of
manufacturing processes. In Chapter 1, manufacturing was
defined as a transformation process. It is the material that is
transformed; and it is the behavior of the material when
subjected to the particular forces, temperatures, and other
physical parameters of the process that determines the
success of the operation. Certain materials respond well
to certain types of manufacturing processes, and poorly or
not at all to others. What are the characteristics and properties of materials that determine their capacity to be transformed by the different processes?
Part I of this book consists of four chapters that address
this question. The current chapter considers the atomic structure of matter and the bonding between atoms and molecules.
It also shows how atoms and molecules in engineering materials organize themselves into two structural forms: crystalline
and noncrystalline. It turns out that the basic engineering
materials—metals,ceramics,and polymers—can existineither
form, although a preference for a particular form is usually
exhibited by a given material. For example, metals almost
always exist as crystals in their solid state. Glass (e.g., window
glass), a ceramic, assumes a noncrystalline form. Some polymers are mixtures of crystalline and amorphous structures.
Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the mechanical and physical
properties that are relevant in manufacturing. Of course, these
properties are also important in product design. Chapter 5 is
concerned with several part and product attributes that are
specified during product design and must be achieved in

manufacturing: dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish. Chapter 5 also describes how these
attributes are measured.

2.1

ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND THE ELEMENTS
The basic structural unit of matter is the atom. Each atom is composed of a positively charged
nucleus, surrounded by a sufficient number of negatively charged electrons so that the charges
are balanced. The number of electrons identifies the atomic number and the element of the
atom. There are slightly more than 100 elements (not counting a few extras that have been
artificially synthesized), and these elements are the chemical building blocks of all matter.
Just as there are differences among the elements, there are also similarities. The
elements can be grouped into families and relationships established between and within the
families by means of the Periodic Table, shown in Figure 2.1. In the horizontal direction there
is a certain repetition, or periodicity, in the arrangement of elements. Metallic elements
occupy the left and center portions of the chart, and nonmetals are located to the right.
Between them, along a diagonal, is a transition zone containing elements called metalloids or
semimetals. In principle, each of the elements can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on
temperature and pressure. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, they each have a
natural phase; e.g., iron (Fe) is a solid, mercury (Hg) is a liquid, and nitrogen (N) is a gas.
In the table, the elements are arranged into vertical columns and horizontal rows in
such a way that similarities exist among elements in the same columns. For example, in the
extreme right column are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon),
all of which exhibit great chemical stability and low reaction rates. The halogens (fluorine,
chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) in column VIIA share similar properties (hydrogen is
not included among the halogens). The noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) in column IB
have similar properties. Generally there are correlations in properties among elements within
a given column, whereas differences exist among elements in different columns.

FIGURE 2.2 Simple model of atomic structure for several elements: (a) hydrogen, (b) helium, (c) fluorine, (d) neon,
and (e) sodium.

Many of the similarities and differences among the elements can be explained by their
respective atomic structures. The simplest model of atomic structure, called the planetary
model, shows the electrons of the atom orbiting around the nucleus at certain fixed distances,
called shells, as shown in Figure 2.2. The hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has one electron in
theorbitclosest to thenucleus. Helium (atomicnumber 2) has two. Also shown in the figure are
the atomic structures for fluorine (atomic number 9), neon (atomic number 10), and sodium
(atomic number 11). One might infer from these models that there is a maximum number of
electronsthatcanbecontainedinagivenorbit.This turnsouttobecorrect,andthemaximumis
defined by
Maximum number of electrons in an orbit ¼ 2n2

ð2:1Þ

where n identifies the orbit, with n ¼ 1 closest to the nucleus.
Thenumberofelectronsintheoutermostshell,relativetothemaximumnumberallowed,
determines to a large extent the atom’s chemical affinity for other atoms. These outer-shell
electrons are called valence electrons. For example, because a hydrogen atom has only one
electron in its single orbit, it readily combines with another hydrogen atom to form a
hydrogen molecule H2. For the same reason, hydrogen also reacts readily with various other
elements (e.g., to form H2O). In the helium atom, the two electrons in its only orbit are the
maximum allowed (2n2 ¼ 2(1)2 ¼ 2), and so helium is very stable. Neon is stable for the same
reason: Its outermost orbit (n ¼ 2) has eight electrons (the maximum allowed), so neon is an
inert gas.
In contrast to neon, fluorine has one fewer electron in its outer shell (n ¼ 2) than the
maximum allowed and is readily attracted to other elements that might share an electron to
make a more stable set. The sodium atom seems divinely made for the situation, with one
electron in its outermost orbit. It reacts strongly with fluorine to form the compound sodium
fluoride, as pictured in Figure 2.3.

fluoride molecule, formed by the
transfer of the ‘‘extra’’ electron
of the sodium atom to complete

Chapter 2/The Nature of Materials

At the low atomic numbers considered here, the prediction of the number of electrons
in the outer orbit is straightforward. As the atomic number increases to higher levels, the
allocation of electrons to the different orbits becomes somewhat more complicated. There
are rules and guidelines, based on quantum mechanics, that can be used to predict the
positions of the electrons among the various orbits and explain their characteristics. A
discussion of these rules is somewhat beyond the scope of the coverage of materials for
manufacturing.

2.2

BONDING BETWEEN ATOMS AND MOLECULES
Atoms are held together in molecules by various types of bonds that depend on the valence
electrons. By comparison, molecules are attracted to each other by weaker bonds, which
generally result from the electron configuration in the individual molecules. Thus, we have
two types of bonding: (1) primary bonds, generally associated with the formation of
molecules; and (2) secondary bonds, generally associated with attraction between molecules. Primary bonds are much stronger than secondary bonds.
Primary Bonds Primary bonds are characterized by strong atom-to-atom attractions
that involve the exchange of valence electrons. Primary bonds include the following forms:
(a) ionic, (b) covalent, and (c) metallic, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. Ionic and covalent
bonds are called intramolecular bonds because they involve attractive forces between
atoms within the molecule.
In the ionic bond, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which are
in turn attracted to the atoms of some other element to increase their electron count in the
outermost shell to eight. In general, eight electrons in the outer shell is the most stable
atomic configuration (except for the very light atoms), and nature provides a very strong
bond between atoms that achieves this configuration. The previous example of the reaction
of sodium and fluorine to form sodium fluoride (Figure 2.3) illustrates this form of atomic
bond. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a more common example. Because of the transfer of
electrons between the atoms, sodium and fluorine (or sodium and chlorine) ions are
formed, from which this bonding derives its name. Properties of solid materials with ionic
bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor ductility.
The covalent bond is one in which electrons are shared (as opposed to transferred)
between atoms in their outermost shells to achieve a stable set of eight. Fluorine and
diamond are two examples of covalent bonds. In fluorine, one electron from each of two
atoms is shared to form F2 gas, as shown in Figure 2.5(a). In the case of diamond, which is
carbon (atomic number 6), each atom has four neighbors with which it shares electrons.
This produces a very rigid three-dimensional structure, not adequately represented in
Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high hardness of this material. Other forms of

FIGURE 2.4 Three forms of
primary bonding: (a) ionic,
(b) covalent, and (c) metallic.

FIGURE 2.5 Two examples

carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this rigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent
bonding generally possess high hardness and low electrical conductivity.
The metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals and metal
alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few electrons in their outermost
orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in, say, a given block of metal.
Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom basis, metallic bonding involves the
sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms to form a general electron cloud that permeates
the entire block. This cloud provides the attractive forces to hold the atoms together and forms
a strong, rigid structure in most cases. Because of the general sharing of electrons, and their
freedom to move within the metal, metallic bonding provides for good electrical conductivity.
Other typical properties of materials characterized by metallic bonding include good
conduction of heat and good ductility. (Although some of these terms are yet to be defined,
the text relies on the reader’s general understanding of material properties.)
Secondary Bonds Whereas primary bonds involve atom-to-atom attractive forces, secondary bonds involve attraction forces between molecules, or intermolecular forces. There is
no transfer or sharing of electrons in secondary bonding, and these bonds are therefore
weaker than primary bonds. There are three forms of secondary bonding: (a) dipole forces,
(b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding, illustrated in Figure 2.6. Types (a) and (b)
are often referred to as van der Waals forces, after the scientist who first studied and
quantified them.
Dipole forces arise in a molecule comprised of two atoms that have equal and opposite
electrical charges. Each molecule therefore forms a dipole, as shown in Figure 2.6(a) for
hydrogen chloride. Although the material is electrically neutral in its aggregate form, on a
molecular scale the individual dipoles attract each other, given the proper orientation of
positive and negative ends of the molecules. These dipole forces provide a net intermolecular
bonding within the material.
London forces involve attractive forces between nonpolar molecules; that is, the atoms
in the molecule do not form dipoles in the sense of the preceding paragraph. However, owing
to the rapid motion of the electrons in orbit around the molecule, temporary dipoles form
when more electrons happen to be on one side of the molecule than the other, as suggested by

FIGURE 2.6

Three types of secondary bonding: (a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding.

Chapter 2/The Nature of Materials

Figure 2.6(b). These instantaneous dipoles provide a force of attraction between molecules in
the material.
Finally, hydrogen bonding occurs in molecules containing hydrogen atoms that are
covalently bonded to another atom (e.g., oxygen in H2O). Because the electrons needed to
complete the shell of the hydrogen atom are aligned on one side of its nucleus, the opposite
side has a net positive charge that attracts the electrons of atoms in neighboring molecules.
Hydrogen bonding is illustrated in Figure 2.6(c) for water, and is generally a stronger
intermolecular bonding mechanism than the other two forms of secondary bonding. It is
important in the formation of many polymers.

2.3

CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES
Atoms and molecules are used as building blocks for the more macroscopic structure of
matter that is considered here and in the following section. When materials solidify from the
molten state, they tend to close ranks and pack tightly, in many cases arranging themselves
into a very orderly structure, and in other cases, not quite so orderly. Two fundamentally
different material structures can be distinguished:(1) crystalline and (2) noncrystalline.
Crystalline structures are examined in this section, and noncrystalline in the next. The
video clip on heat treatment shows how metals naturally form into crystal structures.
VIDEO CLIP
Heat treatment: View the segment titled ‘‘metal and alloy structures.’’

Many materials form into crystals on solidification from the molten or liquid state. It
is characteristic of virtually all metals, as well as many ceramics and polymers. A crystalline
structure is one in which the atoms are located at regular and recurring positions in three
dimensions. The pattern may be replicated millions of times within a given crystal. The
structure can be viewed in the form of a unit cell, which is the basic geometric grouping of
atoms that is repeated. To illustrate, consider the unit cell for the body-centered cubic
(BCC) crystal structure shown in Figure 2.7, one of the common structures found in metals.
The simplest model of the BCC unit cell is illustrated in Figure 2.7(a). Although this model
clearly depicts the locations of the atoms within the cell, it does not indicate the close
packing of the atoms that occurs in the real crystal, as in Figure 2.7(b). Figure 2.7(c) shows
the repeating nature of the unit cell within the crystal.

as point locations in a three-dimensional axis system; (b) unit cell model showing closely
packed atoms (sometimes called the hard-ball model); and (c) repeated pattern of the
BCC structure.

FIGURE 2.8 Three types of crystal structures in metals: (a) body-centered cubic, (b) face-centered
cubic, and (c) hexagonal close-packed.

2.3.1 TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES
In metals, three lattice structures are common: (1) body-centered cubic (BCC), (2) facecentered cubic (FCC), and (3) hexagonal close-packed (HCP), illustrated in Figure 2.8.
Crystal structures for the common metals are presented in Table 2.1. Note that some
metals undergo a change of structure at different temperatures. Iron, for example, is BCC
at room temperature; it changes to FCC above 912 C (1674 F) and back to BCC at
temperatures above 1400 C (2550 F). When a metal (or other material) changes structure
like this, it is referred to as being allotropic.

2.3.2 IMPERFECTIONS IN CRYSTALS
Thus far, crystal structures have been discussed as if they were perfect—the unit cell
repeated in the material over and over in all directions. A perfect crystal is sometimes
desirable to satisfy aesthetic or engineering purposes. For instance, a perfect diamond
(contains no flaws) is more valuable than one containing imperfections. In the production
of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable processing
characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern.
However, there are various reasons why a crystal’s lattice structure may not be perfect.
The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the solidifying material to
continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without interruption. Grain boundaries in
metals are an example. In other cases, the imperfections are introduced purposely during the

manufacturing process; for example, the addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to
increase its strength.
The various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term,
imperfection or defect, refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline lattice
structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and (3) surface defects.
Point defects are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single atom or
a few atoms. The defects can take various forms including, as shown in Figure 2.9: (a) vacancy,
the simplest defect, involving a missing atom within the lattice structure; (b) ion-pair
vacancy, also called a Schottky defect, which involves a missing pair of ions of opposite
charge in a compound that has an overall charge balance; (c) interstitialcy, a lattice
distortion produced by the presence of an extra atom in the structure; and (d) displaced
ion, known as a Frenkel defect, which occurs when an ion becomes removed from a regular
position in the lattice structure and inserted into an interstitial position not normally
occupied by such an ion.
A line defect is a connected group of point defects that forms a line in the lattice
structure. The most important line defect is the dislocation, which can take two forms: (a)
edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An edge dislocation is the edge of an extra
plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a). A screw dislocation, Figure 2.10(b), is a spiral within the lattice structure wrapped around an imperfection
line, like a screw is wrapped around its axis. Both types of dislocations can arise in the
crystal structure during solidification (e.g., casting), or they can be initiated during a

deformation process (e.g., metal forming) performed on the solid material. Dislocations
are useful in explaining certain aspects of mechanical behavior in metals.
Surface defects are imperfections that extend in two directions to form a boundary.
The most obvious example is the external surface of a crystalline object that defines its
shape. The surface is an interruption in the lattice structure. Surface boundaries can also lie
inside the material. Grain boundaries are the best example of these internal surface
interruptions. Metallic grains are discussed in a moment, but first consider how deformation occurs in a crystal lattice, and how the process is aided by the presence of dislocations.

2.3.3 DEFORMATION IN METALLIC CRYSTALS
When a crystal is subjected to a gradually increasing mechanical stress, its initial response is to
deform elastically. This can be likened to a tilting of the lattice structure without any changes
of position among the atoms in the lattice, in the manner depicted in Figure 2.11(a) and (b). If
the force is removed, the lattice structure (and therefore the crystal) returns to its original
shape. If the stress reaches a high value relative to the electrostatic forces holding the atoms in
their lattice positions, a permanent shape change occurs, called plastic deformation. What
has happened is that the atoms in the lattice have permanently moved from their previous
locations, and a new equilibrium lattice has been formed, as suggested by Figure 2.11(c).
The lattice deformation shown in (c) of the figure is one possible mechanism, called
slip, by which plastic deformation can occur in a crystalline structure. The other is called
twinning, discussed later.
Slip involves the relative movement of atoms on opposite sides of a plane in the lattice,
called the slip plane. The slip plane must be somehow aligned with the lattice structure
(as indicated in the sketch), and so there are certain preferred directions along which slip is
more likely to occur. The number of these slip directions depends on the lattice type.
The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat more complicated, especially in
three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in Figure 2.11. It turns out that HCP has the
fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC falls in between. HCP metals show poor
ductility and are generally difficult to deform at room temperature. Metals with BCC
structure would figure to have the highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the
only criterion. However, nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the
others, which complicates the issue; and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to
cause slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a notable
exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commercial success in sheetmetal-forming operations, in which it exhibits good ductility. The FCC metals are generally
the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining a good number of slip directions
with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength. All three of these metal structures become
more ductile at elevated temperatures, and this fact is often exploited in shaping them.
Dislocations play an important role in facilitating slip in metals. When a lattice
structure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material deforms

and (c) plastic deformation, in
which atoms in the lattice are

‘‘homes.’’

FIGURE 2.12 Effect of dislocations in the lattice structure under stress. In the series of diagrams, the
movement of the dislocation allows deformation to occur under a lower stress than in a perfect lattice.

much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact that the dislocation
is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the stress, as shown in the series
of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dislocation through the lattice than it is to
deform the lattice itself? The answer is that the atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller
displacement within the distorted lattice structure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus,
a lower energy level is needed to realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice
were missing the dislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the
deformation. Because the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of
atoms at the dislocation continues at the lower stress level.
The slip phenomenon and the influence of dislocations have been explained here
on a very microscopic basis. On a larger scale, slip occurs many times over throughout the
metal when subjected to a deforming load, thus causing it to exhibit the familiar
macroscopic behavior. Dislocations represent a good-news–bad-news situation. Because
of dislocations, the metal is more ductile and yields more readily to plastic deformation
(forming) during manufacturing. However, from a product design viewpoint, the metal is
not nearly as strong as it would be in the absence of dislocations.
Twinning is a second way in which metal crystals plastically deform. Twinning can be
defined as a mechanism of plastic deformation in which atoms on one side of a plane (called
the twinning plane) are shifted to form a mirror image of the other side of the plane. It is
illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP metals (e.g., magnesium, zinc)

FIGURE 2.13 Twinning
involves the formation of an
atomic mirror image (i.e., a
‘‘twin’’) on the opposite side
of the twinning plane: (a) before, and (b) after twinning.

because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another factor in twinning is the rate of
deformation. The slip mechanism requires more time than twinning, which can occur almost
instantaneously. Thus, in situations in which the deformation rate is very high, metals twin
that would otherwise slip. Low carbon steel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity;
when subjected to high strain rates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip.

2.3.4 GRAINS AND GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS
A given block of metal may contain millions of individual crystals, called grains. Each grain has
its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are randomly oriented within the
block. Such a structure is referred to as polycrystalline. It is easy to understand how such a
structureis thenaturalstateofthematerial.When theblockiscooled from themolten stateand
begins to solidify, nucleation of individual crystals occurs at random positions and orientations
throughout the liquid. As these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at
their interface a surface defect—a grain boundary. The grain boundary consists of a transition
zone, perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain.
The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation sites
in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In a casting
process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls of the mold, which
motivate a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls.
Grain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller grain size,
whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important in metals because it
affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally preferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hardness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming), because it means higher ductility during deformation and
a better surface on the finished product.
Another factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain boundaries
in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure that interrupt the
continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why smaller grain size—
therefore more grains and more grain boundaries—increases the strength of the metal.
By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries also contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is deformed. The property is called strain
hardening, and it is examined more closely in the discussion of mechanical properties in
Chapter 3.

2.4

NONCRYSTALLINE (AMORPHOUS) STRUCTURES
Many important materials are noncrystalline—liquids and gases, for example. Water and air
have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when it is melted.
Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point of 38 C (37 F).
Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline form in their solid state; the
term amorphous is often used to describe these materials. Glass, many plastics, and rubber
fall into this category. Many important plastics are mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline
forms. Even metals can be amorphous rather than crystalline, given that the cooling rate
during transformation from liquid to solid is fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging
themselves into their preferred regular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten
metal is poured between cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls.
Two closely related features distinguish noncrystalline from crystalline materials:
(1) absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure, and (2) differences in
melting and thermal expansion characteristics.

Chapter 2/The Nature of Materials

FIGURE 2.14 Illustration of
difference in structure between:
(a) crystalline and (b) noncrystalline
materials. The crystal structure is
regular, repeating, and denser,
whereas the noncrystalline structure
is more loosely packed and random.

The difference in molecular structure can be visualized with reference to Figure 2.14.
The closely packed and repeating pattern of the crystal structure is shown on the left; and the
less dense and random arrangement of atoms in the noncrystalline material on the right.
The difference is demonstrated by a metal when it melts. The more loosely packed atoms in
the molten metal show an increase in volume (reduction in density) compared with the
material’s solid crystalline state. This effect is characteristic of most materials when melted.
(Ice is a notable exception; liquid water is denser than solid ice.) It is a general characteristic
of liquids and solid amorphous materials that they are absent of long-range order as on the
right in our figure.
The melting phenomenon will now be examined in more detail, and in doing so, the
second important difference between crystalline and noncrystalline structures will be defined.
As indicated, a metal experiences an increase in volume when it melts from the solid to the
liquid state. For a pure metal, this volumetric change occurs rather abruptly, at a constant
temperature (i.e., the melting temperature Tm), as indicated in Figure 2.15. The change
represents a discontinuity from the slopes on either side in the plot. The gradual slopes
characterize the metal’s thermal expansion—the change in volume as a function of temperature, which isusually different in the solid and liquid states. Associated with the sudden volume
increase as the metal transforms from solid to liquid at the melting point is the addition of a
certain quantity of heat, called the heat of fusion, which causes the atoms to lose the dense,
regular arrangement of the crystalline structure. The process is reversible; it operates in both
directions. If the molten metal is cooled through its melting temperature, the same abrupt
change in volume occurs (except that it is a decrease), and the same quantity of heat is given off
by the metal.
An amorphous material exhibits quite different behavior than that of a pure metal when
it changes from solid to liquid, as shown in Figure 2.15. The process is again reversible, but
observe the behavior of the amorphous material during cooling from the liquid state, rather

FIGURE 2.15 Characteristic change
in volume for a pure metal (a crystalline
structure), compared to the same
volumetric changes in glass (a
noncrystalline structure).

than during melting from the solid, as before. Glass (silica, SiO2) is used to illustrate. At high
temperatures, glass is a true liquid, and the molecules are free to move about as in the usual
definition of a liquid. As the glass cools, it gradually transforms into the solid state, going
through a transition phase, called a supercooled liquid, before finally becoming rigid. It does
not show the sudden volumetric change that is characteristic of crystalline materials; instead, it
passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal expansion slope. In
this supercooled liquid region, the material becomes increasingly viscous as the temperature
continues to decrease. As it cools further, a point is finally reached at which the supercooled
liquid converts to a solid. This is called the glass-transition temperature Tg. At this point, there
is a change in the thermal expansion slope. (It might be more precise to refer to it as the
thermal contraction slope; however, the slope is the same for expansion and contraction.) The
rate of thermal expansion is lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid.
The difference in behavior between crystalline and noncrystalline materials can be
traced to the response of their respective atomic structures to changes in temperature. When
a pure metal solidifies from the molten state, the atoms arrange themselves into a regular and
recurring structure. This crystal structure is much more compact than the random and loosely
packed liquid from which it formed. Thus, the process of solidification produces the abrupt
volumetric contraction observed in Figure 2.15 for the crystalline material. By contrast,
amorphous materials do not achieve this repeating and closely packed structure at low
temperatures. The atomic structure is the same random arrangement as in the liquid state;
thus, there is no abrupt volumetric change as these materials transition from liquid to solid.

2.5

ENGINEERING MATERIALS
Let us summarize how atomic structure, bonding, and crystal structure (or absence
thereof) are related to the type of engineering material—metals, ceramics, and polymer.
Metals Metals have crystalline structures in the solid state, almost without exception.
The unit cells of these crystal structures are almost always BCC, FCC, or HCP. The atoms of
the metals are held together by metallic bonding, which means that their valence electrons
can move about with relative freedom (compared with the other types of atomic and
molecular bonding). These structures and bonding generally make the metals strong and
hard. Many of the metals are quite ductile (capable of being deformed, which is useful in
manufacturing), especially the FCC metals. Other general properties of metals related to
structure and bonding include: high electrical and thermal conductivity, opaqueness
(impervious to light rays), and reflectivity (capacity to reflect light rays).
Ceramics Ceramic molecules are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, or both.
The metallic atoms release or share their outermost electrons to the nonmetallic atoms, and
a strong attractive force exists within the molecules. The general properties that result from
these bonding mechanisms include: high hardness and stiffness (even at elevated temperatures), brittleness (no ductility), electrical insulation (nonconducting) properties, refractoriness (being thermally resistant), and chemical inertness.
Ceramics possess either a crystalline or noncrystalline structure. Most ceramics have
a crystal structure, whereas glasses based on silica (SiO2) are amorphous. In certain cases,
either structure can exist in the same ceramic material. For example, silica occurs in nature
as crystalline quartz. When this mineral is melted and then cooled, it solidifies to form fused
silica, which has a noncrystalline structure.
Polymers A polymer molecule consists of many repeating mers to form very large
molecules held together by covalent bonding. Elements in polymers are usually carbon

E1C02

14:15:27

Chapter 2/The Nature of Materials

plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine.
Secondary bonding (van der Waals) holds the molecules together within the aggregate
material (intermolecular bonding). Polymers have either a glassy structure or mixture of
glassy and crystalline. There are differences among the three polymer types. In thermoplastic polymers, the molecules consist of long chains of mers in a linear structure. These
materials can be heated and cooled without substantially altering their linear structure. In
thermosetting polymers, the molecules transform into a rigid, three-dimensional structure on cooling from a heated plastic condition. If thermosetting polymers are reheated,
they degrade chemically rather than soften. Elastomers have large molecules with coiled
structures. The uncoiling and recoiling of the molecules when subjected to stress cycles
motivate the aggregate material to exhibit its characteristic elastic behavior.
The molecular structure and bonding of polymers provide them with the following
typical properties: low density, high electrical resistivity (some polymers are used as
insulating materials), and low thermal conductivity. Strength and stiffness of polymers
vary widely. Some are strong and rigid (although not matching the strength and stiffness of
metals or ceramics), whereas others exhibit highly elastic behavior.

Mechanical properties of a material determine its behavior
when subjected to mechanical stresses. These properties include elastic modulus, ductility, hardness, and various measures of strength. Mechanical properties are important in
design because the function and performance of a product
depend on its capacity to resist deformation under the stresses
encountered in service. In design, the usual objective is for the
product and its components to withstand these stresses without significant change in geometry. This capability depends on
properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength. In
manufacturing, the objective is just the opposite. Here, stresses
that exceed the yield strength of the material must be applied
to alter its shape. Mechanical processes such as forming and
machining succeed by developing forces that exceed the
material’s resistance to deformation. Thus, there is the following dilemma: Mechanical properties that are desirable to the
designer, such as high strength, usually make the manufacture
of the product more difficult. It is helpful for the manufacturing engineer to appreciate the design viewpoint and for the
designer to be aware of the manufacturing viewpoint.
This chapter examines the mechanical properties of
materials that are most relevant in manufacturing.

3.1

STRESS–STRAIN
RELATIONSHIPS

There are three types of static stresses to which materials can
be subjected: tensile, compressive, and shear. Tensile stresses
tend to stretch the material, compressive stresses tend to
squeeze it, and shear involves stresses that tend to cause
adjacent portions of the material to slide against each other.
The stress–strain curve is the basic relationship that describes
the mechanical properties of materials for all three types.

specimen; and (c) setup of the tensile test.

3.1.1 TENSILE PROPERTIES
The tensile test is the most common procedure for studying the stress–strain relationship,
particularly for metals. In the test, a force is applied that pulls the material, tending to
elongate it and reduce its diameter, as shown in Figure 3.1(a). Standards by ASTM
(American Society for Testing and Materials) specify the preparation of the test specimen
and the conduct of the test itself. The typical specimen and general setup of the tensile test is
illustrated in Figure 3.1(b) and (c), respectively.
The starting test specimen has an original length Lo and area Ao. The length is
measured as the distance between the gage marks, and the area is measured as the (usually
round) cross section of the specimen. During the testing of a metal, the specimen stretches,
then necks, and finally fractures, as shown in Figure 3.2. The load and the change in length of
the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds, to provide the data required to determine

the stress–strain relationship. There are two different types of stress–strain curves:
(1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true stress–strain. The first is more important in
design, and the second is more important in manufacturing.
Engineering Stress–Strain The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are defined
relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are of interest in
design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any component of the
product will not significantly change its shape. The components are designed to withstand
the anticipated stresses encountered in service.
A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic specimen
is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The engineering stress at any point on the curve is defined as
the force divided by the original area:
s¼

F
Ao

ð3:1Þ

where s ¼ engineering stress, MPa (lb/in2), F ¼ applied force in the test, N (lb), and
Ao ¼ original area of the test specimen, mm2 (in2).
The engineering strain at any point in the test is given by
L  Lo
ð3:2Þ
e¼
Lo
where e ¼ engineering strain, mm/mm (in/in); L ¼ length at any point during the
elongation, mm (in); and Lo ¼ original gage length, mm (in).
The units of engineering strain are given as mm/mm (in/in), but think of it as
representing elongation per unit length, without units.
The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two distinct
forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relationship between
stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by returning to its
original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is defined by Hooke’s
law:
s ¼ Ee
ð3:3Þ
where E ¼ modulus of elasticity, MPa (lb/in2), a measure of the inherent stiffness of a
material.

Although diamond is not a ceramic, it is often compared with the ceramic materials.

It is a constant of proportionality whose value is different for different materials.
Table 3.1 presents typical values for several materials, metals and nonmetals.
As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is finally reached at which the
material begins to yield. This yield point Y of the material can be identified in the figure by
the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the start of yielding is usually
difficult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually occur as an abrupt change in slope), Y
is typically defined as the stress at which a strain offset of 0.2% from the straight line has
occurred. More specifically, it is the point where the stress–strain curve for the material
intersects a line that is parallel to the straight portion of the curve but offset from it by a
strain of 0.2%. The yield point is a strength characteristic of the material, and is therefore
often referred to as the yield strength (other names include yield stress and elastic limit).
The yield point marks the transition to the plastic region and the start of plastic
deformation of the material. The relationship between stress and strain is no longer guided
by Hooke’s law. As the load is increased beyond the yield point, elongation of the specimen
proceeds, but at a much faster rate than before, causing the slope of the curve to change
dramatically, as shown in Figure 3.3. Elongation is accompanied by a uniform reduction in
cross-sectional area, consistent with maintaining constant volume. Finally, the applied load
F reaches a maximum value, and the engineering stress calculated at this point is called the
tensile strength or ultimate tensile strength of the material. It is denoted as TS where
TS ¼ F max =Ao . TS and Y are important strength properties in design calculations. (They
are also used in manufacturing calculations.) Some typical values of yield strength and
tensile strength are listed in Table 3.2 for selected metals. Conventional tensile testing of
ceramics is difficult, and an alternative test is used to measure the strength of these brittle
materials (Section 3.1.3). Polymers differ in their strength properties from metals and
ceramics because of viscoelasticity (Section 3.5).
To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins to decline,
and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation known as necking.
Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length, straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of that section narrows down (necks)
significantly until failure occurs. The stress calculated immediately before failure is known as
the fracture stress.
The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechanical
property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of this
property is ductility, the ability of a material to plastically strain without fracture. This

Values given are typical. For alloys, there is a wide range in strength values depending on composition and treatment (e.g., heat
treatment, work hardening).
a

measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation is defined as
Lf  Lo
ð3:4Þ
Lo
where EL ¼ elongation, often expressed as a percent; Lf ¼ specimen length at fracture,
mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of the specimen
have been put back together; and Lo ¼ original specimen length, mm (in).
Area reduction is defined as
EL ¼

Ao  Af
ð3:5Þ
Ao
where AR ¼ area reduction, often expressed as a percent; Af ¼ area of the cross section at
the point of fracture, mm2(in2); and Ao ¼ original area, mm2 (in2).
There are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that
occurs in metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and
area reduction. Despite these difficulties, percent elongation and percent area reduction
are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice. Some typical
values of percent elongation for various materials (mostly metals) are listed in Table 3.3.
AR ¼

True Stress–Strain Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the original area
of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual (instantaneous)
area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the actual area were used,
the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value obtained by dividing the
instantaneous value of area into the applied load is defined as the true stress:
F
ð3:6Þ
A
where s ¼ true stress, MPa (lb/in2); F ¼ force, N (lb); and A ¼ actual (instantaneous) area
resisting the load, mm2 (in2).
Similarly, true strain provides a more realistic assessment of the ‘‘instantaneous’’
elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test can be
estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then adding up the
strain values. In the limit, true strain is defined as

where L ¼ instantaneous length at any moment during elongation.
At the end of the test (or other deformation), the final strain value can be
calculated using L ¼ Lf.
When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true stress
and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic region, the
plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain is nearly equal to
engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress values are also very close
to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that the cross-sectional area of the test
specimen is not significantly reduced in the elastic region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to
relate true stress to true strain: s ¼ E e.
The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counterpart
occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region because the

instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been continuously reduced
during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the previous curve, a downturn
finally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used in the figure to indicate the projected
continuation of the true stress–strain plot if necking had not occurred.
As strain becomes significant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and
engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineering
strain by
e ¼ lnð1 þ eÞ

ð3:8Þ

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression
s ¼ sð1 þ eÞ

ð3:9Þ

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until necking
begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its significance was lost
because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate stress. Now when the true
stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly. What it means is that the metal is
becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the property called strain hardening that was
mentioned in the previous chapter in the discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a
property that most metals exhibit to a greater or lesser degree.
Strain hardening, or work hardening as it is often called, is an important factor in certain
manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Consider the behavior of a metal as it is
affected by this property. If the portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic
region were plotted on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in
Figure 3.5. Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship
between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as
ð3:10Þ
s ¼ Ken
This equation is called the flow curve, and it provides a good approximation of the
behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening. The
constant K is called the strength coefficient, MPa (lb/in2), and it equals the value of true stress
at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter n is called the strain hardening exponent,
and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly related to a metal’s tendency to
work harden. Typical values of K and n for selected metals are given in Table 3.4.
Necking in a tensile test and metal-forming operations that stretch the workpart is
closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during the initial part of
the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs throughout the length because if
any element in the specimen becomes strained more than the surrounding metal, its strength
increases because of work hardening, thus making it more resistant to additional strain until

the surrounding metal has been strained an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large
that uniform straining cannot be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (because of
buildup of dislocations at grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and
necking is initiated, leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a
particular metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent
n. Therefore, a higher n value means that the metal can be strained further before the onset of
necking during tensile loading.
Types of Stress–Strain Relationships Much information about elastic–plastic behavior
is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law ðs ¼ EeÞ governs the
metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the flow curve ðs ¼ Ken Þ determines the behavior
in the plastic region. Three basic forms of stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of
nearly all types of solid materials, shown in Figure 3.6:
1. Perfectly elastic. The behavior of this material is defined completely by its stiffness,
indicated by the modulus of elasticity E. It fractures rather than yielding to plastic flow.
Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermosetting polymers possess
stress–strain curves that fall into this category. These materials are not good candidates for
forming operations.
2. Elastic and perfectly plastic. This material has a stiffness defined by E. Once the yield
strength Y is reached, the material deforms plastically at the same stress level. The flow
curve is given by K ¼ Y and n ¼ 0. Metals behave in this fashion when they have been

categories of stress–
strain relationship:

plastic, and (c) elastic and

heated to sufficiently high temperatures that they recrystallize rather than strain harden
during deformation. Lead exhibits this behavior at room temperature because room
temperature is above the recrystallization point for lead.
3. Elastic and strain hardening. This material obeys Hooke’s law in the elastic region. It
begins to flow at its yield strength Y. Continued deformation requires an ever-increasing
stress, given by a flow curve whose strength coefficient K is greater than Y and whose
strain-hardening exponent n is greater than zero. The flow curve is generally represented
as a linear function on a natural logarithmic plot. Most ductile metals behave this way
when cold worked.
Manufacturing processes that deform materials through the application of tensile
stresses include wire and bar drawing (Section 19.6) and stretch forming (Section 20.6.1).

3.1.2 COMPRESSION PROPERTIES
A compression test applies a load that squeezes a cylindrical specimen between two
platens, as illustrated in Figure 3.7. As the specimen is compressed, its height is reduced
and its cross-sectional area is increased. Engineering stress is defined as
s¼

F
Ao

ð3:11Þ

where Ao ¼ original area of the specimen.
This is the same definition of engineering stress used in the tensile test. The
engineering strain is defined as
e¼

h  ho
ho

ð3:12Þ

where h ¼ height of the specimen at a particular moment into the test, mm (in); and
ho ¼ starting height, mm (in).
Because the height is decreased during compression, the value of e will be negative.
The negative sign is usually ignored when expressing values of compression strain.
When engineering stress is plotted against engineering strain in a compression test, the
results appear as in Figure 3.8. The curve is divided into elastic and plastic regions, as before,

strain curve for a compression test.

but the shape of the plastic portion of the curve is different from its tensile test complement.
Because compression causes the cross section to increase (rather than decrease as in the
tensile test), the load increases more rapidly than previously. This results in a higher value of
calculated engineering stress.
Something else happens in the compression test that contributes to the increase in
stress. As the cylindrical specimen is squeezed, friction at the surfaces in contact with the
platens tends to prevent the ends of the cylinder from spreading. Additional energy is
consumed by this friction during the test, and this results in a higher applied force. It also
shows up as an increase in the computed engineering stress. Hence, owing to the increase in
cross-sectional area and friction between the specimen and the platens, the characteristic
engineering stress–strain curve is obtained in a compression test as seen in the figure.
Another consequence of the friction between the surfaces is that the material near
the middle of the specimen is permitted to increase in area much more than at the ends. This
results in the characteristic barreling of the specimen, as seen in Figure 3.9.
Although differences exist between the engineering stress–strain curves in tension and
compression, when the respective data are plotted as true stress–strain, the relationships are
nearly identical (for almost all materials). Because tensile test results are more abundant in the
literature, values of the flow curve parameters (K and n) can be derived from tensile test data

and applied with equal validity to a compression operation. What must be done in using the
tensile test results for a compression operation is to ignore the effect of necking, a phenomenon that is peculiar to straining induced by tensile stresses. In compression, there is no
corresponding collapse of the work. In previous plots of tensile stress–strain curves, the data
were extended beyond the point of necking by means of the dashed lines. The dashed lines
better represent the behavior of the material in compression than the actual tensile test data.
Compression operations in metal forming are much more common than stretching
operations. Important compression processes in industry include rolling, forging, and
extrusion (Chapter 19).

3.1.3 BENDING AND TESTING OF BRITTLE MATERIALS
Bending operations are used to form metal plates and sheets. As shown in Figure 3.10,
the process of bending a rectangular cross section subjects the material to tensile stresses
(and strains) in the outer half of the bent section and compressive stresses (and strains) in
the inner half. If the material does not fracture, it becomes permanently (plastically) bent
as shown in (3.1) of Figure 3.10.
Hard, brittle materials (e.g., ceramics), which possess elasticity but little or no
plasticity, are often tested by a method that subjects the specimen to a bending load.
These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of problems in
preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press jaws that hold the
specimen. The bending test (also known as the flexure test) is used to test the strength of
these materials, using a setup illustrated in the first diagram in Figure 3.10. In this
procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section is positioned between two supports,
and a load is applied at its center. In this configuration, the test is called a three-point
bending test. A four-point configuration is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do
not flex to the exaggerated extent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until
immediately before fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of
the outer fibers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in cleavage, a failure mode
associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures, in which
separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes. The strength value
derived from this test is called the transverse rupture strength, calculated from the formula
TRS ¼

1:5 FL
bt2

ð3:13Þ

FIGURE 3.10 Bending of a rectangular cross section results in both tensile and compressive stresses in the material:

where TRS ¼ transverse rupture strength, MPa (lb/in2); F ¼ applied load at fracture, N
(lb); L ¼ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and b and t are the dimensions
of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the figure, mm (in).
The flexure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic
polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture, TRS
cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two measures is
used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deflection, or (2) the deflection observed at a
given load.

3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES
Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin element
to deflect it, as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is defined as
F
ð3:14Þ
t¼
A
where t ¼ shear stress, lb/in2 (MPa); F ¼ applied force, N (lb); and A ¼ area over which the
force is applied, in2 (mm2).
Shear strain can be defined as
d
g¼
ð3:15Þ
b
where g ¼ shear strain, mm/mm (in/in); d ¼ the deflection of the element, mm (in); and
b ¼ the orthogonal distance over which deflection occurs, mm (in).
Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a torsion test, in which a thin-walled
tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque is increased,
the tube deflects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry.
The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation

where T ¼ applied torque, N-mm (lb-in); R ¼ radius of the tube measured to the neutral
axis of the wall, mm (in); and t ¼ wall thickness, mm (in).

the tube, converting this into a distance deflected, and dividing by the gauge length L.
Reducing this to a simple expression

where a ¼ the angular deflection (radians).
A typical shear stress–strain curve is shown in Figure 3.13. In the elastic region, the
relationship is defined by
t ¼ Gg

ð3:18Þ

where G ¼ the shear modulus, or shear modulus of elasticity, MPa (lb/in ). For most
materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by G ¼ 0.4E, where E is the
conventional elastic modulus.
In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens to cause
the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture finally occurs. The relationship in this
region is similar to the flow curve. The shear stress at fracture can be calculated and this is used
as the shear strength S of the material. Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength
data by the approximation: S ¼ 0.7(TS).
Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not
change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain curve
for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress–strain curve.
Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal in
blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 20.1). In machining, the material
is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 21.2).

3.2

HARDNESS
The hardness of a material is defined as its resistance to permanent indentation. Good
hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear. For many
engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufacturing, scratch

E1C03

Section 3.2/Hardness

53

and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall see later in this
section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.

3.2.1 HARDNESS TESTS
Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they are quick
and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate because of
differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hardness tests are
Brinell and Rockwell.
Brinell Hardness Test The Brinell hardness test is widely used for testing metals and
nonmetals of low to medium hardness. It is named after the Swedish engineer who developed
it around 1900. In the test, a hardened steel (or cemented carbide) ball of 10-mm diameter is
pressed into the surface of a specimen using a load of 500, 1500, or 3000 kg. The load is then
divided into the indentation area to obtain the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). In equation
form
HB ¼

2F

qﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
pDb Db  D2b  D2i

ð3:19Þ

where HB ¼ Brinell Hardness Number (BHN); F ¼ indentation load, kg; Db ¼ diameter
of the ball, mm; and Di ¼ diameter of the indentation on the surface, mm.
These dimensions are indicated in Figure 3.14(a). The resulting BHN has units of kg/
mm2, but the units are usually omitted in expressing the number. For harder materials
(above 500 BHN), the cemented carbide ball is used because the steel ball experiences
elastic deformation that compromises the accuracy of the reading. Also, higher loads (1500
and 3000 kg) are typically used for harder materials. Because of differences in results under
different loads, it is considered good practice to indicate the load used in the test when
reporting HB readings.

Rockwell Hardness Test This is another widely used test, named after the metallurgist
who developed it in the early 1920s. It is convenient to use, and several enhancements
over the years have made the test adaptable to a variety of materials.
In the Rockwell Hardness Test, a cone-shaped indenter or small-diameter ball, with
diameter ¼ 1.6 or 3.2 mm (1/16 or 1/8 in) is pressed into the specimen using a minor load of
10 kg, thus seating the indenter in the material. Then, a major load of 150 kg (or other value) is
applied, causing the indenter to penetrate into the specimen a certain distance beyond its
initial position. This additional penetration distance d is converted into a Rockwell hardness
reading by the testing machine. The sequence is depicted in Figure 3.14(b). Differences in
load and indenter geometry provide various Rockwell scales for different materials. The most
common scales are indicated in Table 3.5.
Vickers Hardness Test This test, also developed in the early 1920s, uses a pyramidshaped indenter made of diamond. It is based on the principle that impressions made by this
indenter are geometrically similar regardless of load. Accordingly, loads of various size are
applied, depending on the hardness of the material to be measured. The Vickers Hardness
(HV) is then determined from the formula
HV ¼

1:854 F
D2

ð3:20Þ

where F ¼ applied load, kg, and D ¼ the diagonal of the impression made by the indenter,
mm, as indicated in Figure 3.14(c).
The Vickers test can be used for all metals and has one of the widest scales among
hardness tests.
Knoop Hardness Test The Knoop test, developed in 1939, uses a pyramid-shaped
diamond indenter, but the pyramid has a length-to-width ratio of about 7:1, as indicated
in Figure 3.14(d), and the applied loads are generally lighter than in the Vickers test. It is a
microhardness test, meaning that it is suitable for measuring small, thin specimens or hard
materials that might fracture if a heavier load were applied. The indenter shape facilitates
reading of the impression under the lighter loads used in this test. The Knoop hardness value
(HK) is determined according to the formula
HK ¼ 14:2

F
D2

ð3:21Þ

where F ¼ load, kg; and D ¼ the long diagonal of the indentor, mm.
Because the impression made in this test is generally very small, considerable care
must be taken in preparing the surface to be measured.
Scleroscope The previous tests base their hardness measurements either on the ratio of
applied load divided by the resulting impression area (Brinell, Vickers, and Knoop) or by
the depth of the impression (Rockwell). The Scleroscope is an instrument that measures the
rebound height of a ‘‘hammer’’ dropped from a certain distance above the surface of the
material to be tested. The hammer consists of a weight with diamond indenter attached to it.

Section 3.2/Hardness

The Scleroscope therefore measures the mechanical energy absorbed by the material when
the indenter strikes the surface. The energy absorbed gives an indication of resistance to
penetration, which matches the definition of hardness given here. If more energy is absorbed,
the rebound will be less, meaning a softer material. If less energy is absorbed, the rebound will
be higher—thus a harder material. The primary use of the Scleroscope seems to be in
measuring the hardness of large parts of steel and other ferrous metals.
Durometer The previous tests are all based on resistance to permanent or plastic
deformation (indentation). The durometer is a device that measures the elastic deformation
of rubber and similar flexible materials by pressing an indenter into the surface of the object.
The resistance to penetration is an indication of hardness, as the term is applied to these types
of materials.

3.2.2 HARDNESS OF VARIOUS MATERIALS
This section compares the hardness values of some common materials in the three
engineering material classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers.
Metals The Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests were developed at a time when metals
were the principal engineering materials. A significant amount of data has been collected
using these tests on metals. Table 3.6 lists hardness values for selected metals.
For most metals, hardness is closely related to strength. Because the method of testing
for hardness is usually based on resistance to indentation, which is a form of compression, one
would expect a good correlation between hardness and strength properties determined in a
compression test. However, strength properties in a compression test are nearly the same as
those from a tension test, after allowances for changes in cross-sectional area of the respective
test specimens; so the correlation with tensile properties should also be good.
Brinell hardness (HB) exhibits a close correlation with the ultimate tensile strength
TS of steels, leading to the relationship [9, 15]:
TS ¼ Kh ðHBÞ

ð3:22Þ

where Kh is a constant of proportionality. If TS is expressed in MPa, then Kh ¼ 3.45; and if
TS is in lb/in2, then Kh ¼ 500.

Ceramics The Brinell hardness test is not appropriate for ceramics because the materials
being tested are often harder than the indenter ball. The Vickers and Knoop hardness tests
are used to test these hard materials. Table 3.7 lists hardness values for several ceramics and
hard materials. For comparison, the Rockwell C hardness for hardened tool steel is 65 HRC.
The HRC scale does not extend high enough to be used for the harder materials.
Polymers Polymers have the lowest hardness among the three types of engineering
materials. Table 3.8 lists several of the polymers on the Brinell hardness scale, although this
testing method is not normally used for these materials. It does, however, allow comparison
with the hardness of metals.

3.3

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON PROPERTIES
Temperature has a significant effect on nearly all properties of a material. It is important for
the designer to know the material properties at the operating temperatures of the product
when in service. It is also important to know how temperature affects mechanical properties
in manufacturing. At elevated temperatures, materials are lower in strength and higher in
ductility. The general relationships for metals are depicted in Figure 3.15. Thus, most metals
can be formed more easily at elevated temperatures than when they are cold.
Hot Hardness A property often used to characterize strength and hardness at elevated
temperatures is hot hardness. Hot hardness is simply the ability of a material to retain
hardness at elevated temperatures; it is usually presented as either a listing of hardness values
at different temperatures or as a plot of hardness versus temperature, as in Figure 3.16. Steels
can be alloyed to achieve significant improvements in hot hardness, as shown in the figure.

FIGURE 3.15 General effect of
temperature on strength and ductility.

Ceramics exhibit superior properties at elevated temperatures. These materials are often
selected for high temperature applications, such as turbine parts, cutting tools, and refractory
applications. The outside skin of a shuttle spacecraft is lined with ceramic tiles to withstand
the friction heat of high-speed re-entry into the atmosphere.
Good hot hardness is also desirable in the tooling materials used in many manufacturing operations. Significant amounts of heat energy are generated in most metalworking
processes, and the tools must be capable of withstanding the high temperatures involved.
Recrystallization Temperature Most metals behave at room temperature according to
the flow curve in the plastic region. As the metal is strained, it increases in strength because
of strain hardening (the strain-hardening exponent n > 0). However, if the metal is heated to
a sufficiently elevated temperature and then deformed, strain hardening does not occur.
Instead, new grains are formed that are free of strain, and the metal behaves as a perfectly
plastic material; that is, with a strain-hardening exponent n ¼ 0. The formation of new strainfree grains is a process called recrystallization, and the temperature at which it occurs is
about one-half the melting point (0.5 Tm), as measured on an absolute scale (R or K). This is
called the recrystallization temperature. Recrystallization takes time. The recrystallization
temperature for a particular metal is usually specified as the temperature at which complete
formation of new grains requires about 1 hour.

several materials.

Chapter 3/Mechanical Properties of Materials

Recrystallization is a temperature-dependent characteristic of metals that can be
exploited in manufacturing. By heating the metal to the recrystallization temperature
before deformation, the amount of straining that the metal can endure is substantially
increased, and the forces and power required to carry out the process are significantly
reduced. Forming metals at temperatures above the recrystallization temperature is
called hot working (Section 18.3).

3.4

FLUID PROPERTIES
Fluids behave quite differently than solids. A fluid flows; it takes the shape of the container
that holds it. A solid does not flow; it possesses a geometric form that is independent of its
surroundings. Fluids include liquids and gases; the interest in this section is on the former.
Many manufacturing processes are accomplished on materials that have been converted
from solid to liquid state by heating. Metals are cast in the molten state; glass is formed in a
heated and highly fluid state; and polymers are almost always shaped as thick fluids.
Viscosity Although flow is a defining characteristic of fluids, the tendency to flow varies
for different fluids. Viscosity is the property that determines fluid flow. Roughly, viscosity
can be defined as the resistance to flow that is characteristic of a fluid. It is a measure of the
internal friction that arises when velocity gradients are present in the fluid—the more
viscous the fluid is, the higher the internal friction and the greater the resistance to flow. The
reciprocal of viscosity is fluidity—the ease with which a fluid flows.
Viscosity is defined more precisely with respect to the setup in Figure 3.17, in which two
parallel plates are separated by a distance d. One of the plates is stationary while the other is
moving at a velocity v, and the space between the plates is occupied by a fluid. Orienting these
parameters relative to an axis system, d is in the y-axis direction and v is in the x-axis direction.
The motion of the upper plate is resisted by force F that results from the shear viscous action
of the fluid. This force can be reduced to a shear stress by dividing F by the plate area A
t¼

F
A

ð3:23Þ

where t ¼ shear stress, N/m2 or Pa (lb/in2).
This shear stress is related to the rate of shear, which is defined as the change in
velocity dv relative to dy. That is
dv
g_ ¼
ð3:24Þ
dy
where g_ ¼ shear rate, 1/s; dv ¼ incremental change in velocity, m/s (in/sec); and
dy ¼ incremental change in distance y, m (in).

plates, one stationary

Section 3.4/Fluid Properties

The shear viscosity is the fluid property that defines the relationship between F/A
and dv/dy; that is
F
dv
¼h
A
dy

or t ¼ hg_

ð3:25Þ

where h ¼ a constant of proportionality called the coefficient of viscosity, Pa-s (lb-sec/in2).
Rearranging Equation 3.25, the coefficient of viscosity can be expressed as follows
t
h¼
ð3:26Þ
g_
Thus, the viscosity of a fluid can be defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate
during flow, where shear stress is the frictional force exerted by the fluid per unit area, and
shear rate is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the flow direction. The viscous characteristics of fluids defined by Equation 3.26 were first stated by Newton. He observed that
viscosity was a constant property of a given fluid, and such a fluid is referred to as a Newtonian fluid.
The units of coefficient of viscosity require explanation. In the International System of
units (SI), because shear stress is expressed in N/m2 or Pascals and shear rate in 1/s, it follows
that h has units of N-s/m2 or Pascal-seconds, abbreviated Pa-s. In the U.S. customary units, the
corresponding units are lb/in2 and 1/sec, so that the units for coefficient of viscosity are lb-sec/
in2. Other units sometimes given for viscosity are poise, which ¼ dyne-sec/cm2 (10 poise ¼
1 Pa-s and 6895 Pa-s ¼ 1 lb-sec/in2). Some typical values of coefficient of viscosity for various
fluids are given in Table 3.9. One can observe in several of the materials listed that viscosity
varies with temperature.
Viscosity in Manufacturing Processes For many metals, the viscosity in the molten
state compares with that of water at room temperature. Certain manufacturing processes, notably casting and welding, are performed on metals in their molten state, and
success in these operations requires low viscosity so that the molten metal fills the mold
cavity or weld seam before solidifying. In other operations, such as metal forming and
machining, lubricants and coolants are used in the process, and again the success of these
fluids depends to some extent on their viscosities.
Glass ceramics exhibit a gradual transition from solid to liquid states as temperature
is increased; they do not suddenly melt as pure metals do. The effect is illustrated by the
viscosity values for glass at different temperatures in Table 3.9. At room temperature, glass
is solid and brittle, exhibiting no tendency to flow; for all practical purposes, its viscosity is
infinite. As glass is heated, it gradually softens, becoming less and less viscous (more and
more fluid), until it can finally be formed by blowing or molding at around 1100 C (2000 F).

FIGURE 3.18 Viscous
behaviors of Newtonian and
pseudoplastic fluids.
Polymer melts exhibit
pseudoplastic behavior. For
comparison, the behavior of
a plastic solid material is
shown.

Most polymer-shaping processes are performed at elevated temperatures, at which
the material is in a liquid or highly plastic condition. Thermoplastic polymers represent the
most straightforward case, and they are also the most common polymers. At low temperatures, thermoplastic polymers are solid; as temperature is increased, they typically transform first into a soft rubbery material, and then into a thick fluid. As temperature continues
to rise, viscosity decreases gradually, as in Table 3.9 for polyethylene, the most widely used
thermoplastic polymer. However, with polymers the relationship is complicated by other
factors. For example, viscosity is affected by flow rate. The viscosity of a thermoplastic
polymer is not a constant. A polymer melt does not behave in a Newtonian fashion. Its
relationship between shear stress and shear rate can be seen in Figure 3.18. A fluid that
exhibits this decreasing viscosity with increasing shear rate is called pseudoplastic. This
behavior complicates the analysis of polymer shaping.

3.5

VISCOELASTIC BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS
Another property that is characteristic of polymers is viscoelasticity. Viscoelasticity is the
property of a material that determines the strain it experiences when subjected to
combinations of stress and temperature over time. As the name suggests, it is a
combination of viscosity and elasticity. Viscoelasticity can be explained with reference
to Figure 3.19. The two parts of the figure show the typical response of two materials to an
applied stress below the yield point during some time period. The material in (a) exhibits
perfect elasticity; when the stress is removed, the material returns to its original shape. By
contrast, the material in (b) shows viscoelastic behavior. The amount of strain gradually
increases over time under the applied stress. When stress is removed, the material does
not immediately return to its original shape; instead, the strain decays gradually. If the
stress had been applied and then immediately removed, the material would have
returned immediately to its starting shape. However, time has entered the picture
and played a role in affecting the behavior of the material.
A simple model of viscoelasticity can be developed using the definition of elasticity
as a starting point. Elasticity is concisely expressed by Hooke’s law, s ¼ Ee, which simply
relates stress to strain through a constant of proportionality. In a viscoelastic solid, the

time and temperature.

relationship between stress and strain is time dependent; it can be expressed as
s ðtÞ ¼ f ðtÞe
ð3:27Þ
The time function f(t) can be conceptualized as a modulus of elasticity that depends on
time. It might be written E(t) and referred to as a viscoelastic modulus. The form of this time
function can be complex, sometimes including strain as a factor. Without getting into the
mathematical expressions for it, nevertheless the effect of the time dependency can be
explored. One common effect can be seen in Figure 3.20, which shows the stress–strain
behavior of a thermoplastic polymer under different strain rates. At low strain rate, the
material exhibits significant viscous flow. At high strain rate, it behaves in a much more brittle
fashion.
Temperature is a factor in viscoelasticity. As temperature increases, the viscous behavior
becomes more and more prominent relative to elastic behavior. The material becomes more
like a fluid. Figure 3.21 illustrates this temperature dependence for a thermoplastic polymer.
At low temperatures, the polymer shows elastic behavior. As T increases above the glass
transition temperature Tg, the polymer becomes viscoelastic. As temperature increases
further, it becomes soft and rubbery. At still higher temperatures, it exhibits viscous characteristics. The temperatures at which these modes of behavior are observed vary, depending on the
plastic. Also, the shapes of the modulus versus temperature curve differ according to the

FIGURE 3.20 Stress–strain curve of a
viscoelastic material (thermoplastic
polymer) at high and low strain rates.

proportions of crystalline and amorphous structures in the thermoplastic. Thermosetting
polymers and elastomers behave differently than shown in the figure; after curing, these
polymers do not soften as thermoplastics do at elevated temperatures. Instead, they degrade
(char) at high temperatures.
Viscoelastic behavior manifests itself in polymer melts in the form of shape memory.
As the thick polymer melt is transformed during processing from one shape to another, it
‘‘remembers’’ its previous shape and attempts to return to that geometry. For example, a
common problem in extrusion of polymers is die swell, in which the profile of the extruded
material grows in size, reflecting its tendency to return to its larger cross section in the
extruder barrel immediately before being squeezed through the smaller die opening. The
properties of viscosity and viscoelasticity are examined in more detail in the discussion of
plastic shaping (Chapter 13).

steel ball. The resulting indentation has a diameter
¼ 3.2 mm. (a) Determine the Brinell hardness
number for the metal. (b) If the specimen is steel,

3.26. One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell
hardness tests, for which equipment is available in
the company. He claims that all hardness tests are
based on the same principle as the Brinell test,
which is that hardness is always measured as the

applied load divided by the area of the impressions
made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not,
what are some of the other principles involved in
hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?
3.27. A batch of annealed steel has just been received

is resisted by a shear stress of 10 Pa because of the
viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the velocity
gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the
coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.
3.29. Two parallel surfaces, separated by a space of 0.5 in
that is occupied by a fluid, are moving relative to
each other at a velocity of 25 in/sec. The motion is
resisted by a shear stress of 0.3 lb/in2 because of the

viscosity of the fluid. If the velocity gradient in the
space between the surfaces is constant, determine
the viscosity of the fluid.
3.30. A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter ¼ 125.6 mm and
length ¼ 50.0 mm. In the clearance between the shaft
and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity ¼
0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/
min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient
to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity
that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.

Physical properties, as the term is used here, defines the
behavior of materials in response to physical forces other
than mechanical. They include volumetric, thermal, electrical,
and electrochemical properties. Components in a product must
do more than simply withstand mechanical stresses. They must
conduct electricity (or prevent its conduction), allow heat to be
transferred (or allow it to escape), transmit light (or block its
transmission), and satisfy myriad other functions.
Physical properties are important in manufacturing because they often influence the performance of the process. For
example, thermal properties of the work material in machining
determine the cutting temperature, which affects how long the
tool can be used before it fails. In microelectronics, electrical
properties of silicon and the way in which these properties can
be altered by various chemical and physical processes comprise
the basis of semiconductor manufacturing.
This chapter discusses the physical properties that are
most important in manufacturing—properties that will be
encountered in subsequent chapters of the book. They are
divided into major categories such as volumetric, thermal, electrical, and so on. We also relate these properties to manufacturing, as we did in the previous chapter on mechanical properties.

VOLUMETRIC AND
MELTING PROPERTIES

These properties are related to the volume of solids and how
they are affected by temperature. The properties include
density, thermal expansion, and melting point. They are
explained in the following, and a listing of typical values
for selected engineering materials is presented in Table 4.1.

4.1.1 DENSITY
In engineering, the density of a material is its weight per unit
volume. Its symbol is r, and typical units are g/cm3 (lb/in3).

The density of an element is determined by its atomic number and other factors, such as
atomic radius and atomic packing. The term specific gravity expresses the density of a
material relative to the density of water and is therefore a ratio with no units.
Density is an important consideration in the selection of a material for a given
application, but it is generally not the only property of interest. Strength is also important,
and the two properties are often related in a strength-to-weight ratio, which is the tensile
strength of the material divided by its density. The ratio is useful in comparing materials for
structural applications in aircraft, automobiles, and other products in which weight and
energy are of concern.

4.1.2 THERMAL EXPANSION
The density of a material is a function of temperature. The general relationship is that
density decreases with increasing temperature. Put another way, the volume per unit weight
increases with temperature. Thermal expansion is the name given to this effect that
temperature has on density. It is usually expressed as the coefficient of thermal expansion,
which measures the change in length per degree of temperature, as mm/mm/ C (in/in/ F). It
is a length ratio rather than a volume ratio because this is easier to measure and apply. It is

E1C04

11/10/2009

13:13:25

Page 69

Section 4.1/Volumetric and Melting Properties

69

consistent with the usual design situation in which dimensional changes are of greater
interest than volumetric changes. The change in length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by
L2  L1 ¼ aL1 (T 2  T 1 )

ð4:1Þ

where a ¼ coefficient of thermal expansion,  C1( F1); and L1 and L2 are lengths, mm
(in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures T1 and T2,  C ( F).
Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has a
linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is length
affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also affected. For
some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it decreases. These
changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern, and values like those in
the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range of temperatures contemplated
in service. Changes in the coefficient are more substantial when the metal undergoes a
phase transformation, such as from solid to liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.
In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit and
expansion fit assemblies (Section 32.3) in which a part is heated to increase its size or cooled
to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the part returns to
ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal expansion can be a
problem in heat treatment (Chapter 27) and welding (Section 30.6) because of thermal
stresses that develop in the material during these processes.

4.1.3 MELTING CHARACTERISTICS
For a pure element, the melting point Tm is the temperature at which the material
transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to solid,
occurs at the same temperature and is called the freezing point. For crystalline elements,
such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A certain amount of
heat energy, called the heat of fusion, is required at this temperature to accomplish the
transformation from solid to liquid.
Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature, as it has been described, assumes
equilibrium conditions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is
cooled, it may remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does
not initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be supercooled.
There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melting
occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys do not have a
single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature, called the solidus, and
continues as the temperature increases until finally converting completely to the liquid state at
a temperature called the liquidus. Between the two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of
solid and molten metals, the amounts of each being inversely proportional to their relative
distances from the liquidus and solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions
are eutectic alloys that melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in
the discussion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.
Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In these
materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid material gradually
softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the melting point. During
softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity (increasingly like a fluid)
as it gets closer to the melting point.
These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass are
portrayed in Figure 4.1. The plots show changes in density as a function of temperature
for three hypothetical materials: a pure metal, an alloy, and glass. Plotted in the figure is
the volumetric change, which is the reciprocal of density.

characteristics.

The importance of melting in manufacturing is obvious. In metal casting (Chapters
10 and 11), the metal is melted and then poured into a mold cavity. Metals with lower
melting points are generally easier to cast, but if the melting temperature is too low, the
metal loses its applicability as an engineering material. Melting characteristics of
polymers are important in plastic molding and other polymer shaping processes (Chapter 13). Sintering of powdered metals and ceramics requires knowledge of melting points.
Sintering does not melt the materials, but the temperatures used in the process must
approach the melting point to achieve the required bonding of the powders.

4.2

THERMAL PROPERTIES
Much of the previous section is concerned with the effects of temperature on volumetric
properties of materials. Certainly, thermal expansion, melting, and heat of fusion are
thermal properties because temperature determines the thermal energy level of the
atoms, leading to the changes in the materials. The current section examines several
additional thermal properties—ones that relate to the storage and flow of heat within a
substance. The usual properties of interest are specific heat and thermal conductivity,
values of which are compiled for selected materials in Table 4.2.

4.2.1 SPECIFIC HEAT AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
The specific heat C of a material is defined as the quantity of heat energy required to
increase the temperature of a unit mass of the material by one degree. Some typical values
are listed in Table 4.2. To determine the amount of energy needed to heat a certain weight of
a metal in a furnace to a given elevated temperature, the following equation can be used
H ¼ CW(T 2  T 1 )

ð4:2Þ

where H ¼ amount of heat energy, J (Btu); C ¼ specific heat of the material, J/kg  C (Btu/lb
F); W ¼ its weight, kg (lb); and (T2  T1) ¼ change in temperature,  C ( F).

The volumetric heat storage capacity of a material is often of interest. This is simply
density multiplied by specific heat rC. Thus, volumetric specific heat is the heat energy
required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of material by one degree, J/mm3  C
(Btu/in3  F).
Conduction is a fundamental heat-transfer process. It involves transfer of thermal
energy within a material from molecule to molecule by purely thermal motions; no transfer
of mass occurs. The thermal conductivity of a substance is therefore its capability to transfer
heat through itself by this physical mechanism. It is measured by the coefficient of thermal
conductivity k, which has typical units of J/s mm  C (Btu/in hr  F). The coefficient of
thermal conductivity is generally high in metals, low in ceramics and plastics.
The ratio of thermal conductivity to volumetric specific heat is frequently encountered in heat transfer analysis. It is called the thermal diffusivity K and is determined as

It can be used to calculate cutting temperatures in machining (Section 21.5.1).

4.2.2 THERMAL PROPERTIES IN MANUFACTURING
Thermal properties play an important role in manufacturing because heat generation is
common in so many processes. In some operations heat is the energy that accomplishes
the process; in others heat is generated as a consequence of the process.
Specific heat is of interest for several reasons. In processes that require heating of the
material (e.g., casting, heat treating, and hot metal forming), specific heat determines the
amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature to a desired level, according to
Eq. (4.2).
In many processes carried out at ambient temperature, the mechanical energy to
perform the operation is converted to heat, which raises the temperature of the workpart.
This is common in machining and cold forming of metals. The temperature rise is a function of
the metal’s specific heat. Coolants are often used in machining to reduce these temperatures,
and here the fluid’s heat capacity is critical. Water is almost always employed as the base for
these fluids because of its high heat-carrying capacity.

Chapter 4/Physical Properties of Materials

Thermal conductivity functions to dissipate heat in manufacturing processes, sometimes
beneficially, sometimes not. In mechanical processes such as metal forming and machining,
much of the power required to operate the process is converted to heat. The ability of the work
material and tooling to conduct heat away from its source is highly desirable in these processes.
On the other hand, high thermal conductivity of the work metal is undesirable in fusion
welding processes such as arc welding. In these operations, the heat input must be concentrated at the joint location so that the metal can be melted. For example, copper is generally
difficult to weld because its high thermal conductivity allows heat to be conducted from the
energy source into the work too rapidly, inhibiting heat buildup for melting at the joint.

4.3

MASS DIFFUSION
In addition to heat transfer in a material, there is also mass transfer. Mass diffusion involves
movement of atoms or molecules within a material or across a boundary between two
materials in contact. It is perhaps more appealing to one’s intuition that such a phenomenon
occurs in liquids and gases, but it also occurs in solids. It occurs in pure metals, in alloys, and
between materials that share a common interface. Because of thermal agitation of the
atoms in a material (solid, liquid, or gas), atoms are continuously moving about. In liquids
and gases, where the level of thermal agitation is high, it is a free-roaming movement. In
solids (metals in particular), the atomic motion is facilitated by vacancies and other
imperfections in the crystal structure.
Diffusion can be illustrated by the series of sketches in Figure 4.2 for the case of two
metals suddenly brought into intimate contact with each other. At the start, both metals
have their own atomic structure; but with time there is an exchange of atoms, not only across
the boundary, but within the separate pieces. Given enough time, the assembly of two pieces
will finally reach a uniform composition throughout.
Temperature is an important factor in diffusion. At higher temperatures, thermal
agitation is greater and the atoms can move about more freely. Another factor is the
concentration gradient dc=dx, which indicates the concentration of the two types of atoms
in a direction of interest defined by x. The concentration gradient is plotted in Figure 4.2(b)
to correspond to the instantaneous distribution of atoms in the assembly. The relationship
often used to describe mass diffusion is Fick’s first law:
 
dc
dm ¼ D
A dt
ð4:4Þ
dt
where dm ¼ small amount of material transferred, D ¼ diffusion coefficient of the metal,
which increases rapidly with temperature, dc=dx ¼ concentration gradient, A ¼ area of the
boundary, and dt represents a small time increment. An alternative expression of Eq. (4.4)
gives the mass diffusion rate:
 
dm
dc
¼ D
A
ð4:5Þ
dt
dt
Although these equations are difficult to use in calculations because of the problem
of assessing D, they are helpful in understanding diffusion and the variables on which D
depends.
Mass diffusion is used in several processes. A number of surface-hardening treatments
are based on diffusion (Section 27.4), including carburizing and nitriding. Among the welding
processes, diffusion welding (Section 30.5.2) is used to join two components by pressing them
together and allowing diffusion to occur across the boundary to create a permanent bond.
Diffusion is also used in electronics manufacturing to alter the surface chemistry of a
semiconductor chip in very localized regions to create circuit details (Section 34.4.3).

ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES
Engineering materials exhibit a great variation in their capacity to conduct electricity. This
section defines the physical properties by which this capacity is measured.

4.4.1 RESISTIVITY AND CONDUCTIVITY
The flow of electrical current involves movement of charge carriers—infinitesimally small
particles possessing an electrical charge. In solids, these charge carriers are electrons. In a
liquid solution, charge carriers are positive and negative ions. The movement of charge
carriers is driven by the presence of an electric voltage and resisted by the inherent
characteristics of the material, such as atomic structure and bonding between atoms and
molecules. This is the familiar relationship defined by Ohm’s law

where I ¼ current, A; E ¼ voltage, V; and R ¼ electrical resistance, V.

Resistivity is the basic property that defines a material’s capability to resist current flow.
Table 4.3 lists values of resistivity for selected materials. Resistivity is not a constant; instead
it varies, as do so many other properties, with temperature. For metals, it increases with
temperature.
It is often more convenient to consider a material as conducting electrical current
rather than resisting its flow. The conductivity of a material is simply the reciprocal of
resistivity:
Electrical conductivity ¼

where conductivity has units of (V-m)1 ((V-in)1).

4.4.2 CLASSES OF MATERIALS BY ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES
Metals are the best conductors of electricity, because of their metallic bonding. They have
the lowest resistivity (Table 4.3). Most ceramics and polymers, whose electrons are tightly
bound by covalent and/or ionic bonding, are poor conductors. Many of these materials are
used as insulators because they possess high resistivities.
An insulator is sometimes referred to as a dielectric, because the term dielectric
means nonconductor of direct current. It is a material that can be placed between two
electrodes without conducting current between them. However, if the voltage is high
enough, the current will suddenly pass through the material; for example, in the form of an
arc. The dielectric strength of an insulating material, then, is the electrical potential required
to break down the insulator per unit thickness. Appropriate units are volts/m (volts/in).
In addition to conductors and insulators (or dielectrics), there are also superconductors and semiconductors. A superconductor is a material that exhibits zero resistivity. It
is a phenomenon that has been observed in certain materials at low temperatures

approaching absolute zero. One might expect the existence of this phenomenon, because of
the significant effect that temperature has on resistivity. That these superconducting
materials exist is of great scientific interest. If materials could be developed that exhibit
this property at more normal temperatures, there would be significant practical implications in power transmission, electronic switching speeds, and magnetic field applications.
Semiconductors have already proved their practical worth: Their applications range
from mainframe computers to household appliances and automotive engine controllers. As
one would guess, a semiconductor is a material whose resistivity lies between insulators and
conductors. The typical range is shown in Table 4.3. The most commonly used semiconductor
material today is silicon (Section 7.5.2), largely because of its abundance in nature, relative low
cost, and ease of processing. What makes semiconductors uniqueisthe capacityto significantly
alter conductivities in their surface chemistries in very localized areas to fabricate integrated
circuits (Chapter 34).
Electrical properties play an important role in various manufacturing processes.
Some of the nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove material. Electric
discharge machining (Section 26.3.1) uses the heat generated by electrical energy in the
form of sparks to remove material from metals. Most of the important welding processes
use electrical energy to melt the joint metal. Finally, the capacity to alter the electrical
properties of semiconductor materials is the basis for microelectronics manufacturing.

4.5

ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES
Electrochemistry is a field of science concerned with the relationship between electricity
and chemical changes, and with the conversion of electrical and chemical energy.
In a water solution, the molecules of an acid, base, or salt are dissociated into
positively and negatively charged ions. These ions are the charge carriers in the solution—
they allow electric current to be conducted, playing the same role that electrons play in
metallic conduction. The ionized solution is called an electrolyte; and electrolytic conduction requires that current enter and leave the solution at electrodes. The positive electrode is
called the anode, and the negative electrode is the cathode. The whole arrangement is
called an electrolytic cell. At each electrode, some chemical reaction occurs, such as the
deposition or dissolution of material, or the decomposition of gas from the solution.
Electrolysis is the name given to these chemical changes occurring in the solution.
Consider a specific case of electrolysis: decomposition of water, illustrated in Figure 4.3.
To accelerate the process, dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used as the electrolyte, and platinum
and carbon (both chemically inert) are used as electrodes. The electrolyte dissociates in the
ions Hþ and SO4¼. The Hþ ions are attracted to the negatively charged cathode; upon

reaching it they acquire an electron and combine into molecules of hydrogen gas:
2Hþ þ 2e ! H2 (gas)

ð4:9aÞ

¼

The SO4 ions are attracted to the anode, transferring electrons to it to form additional
sulfuric acid and liberate oxygen:
2SO4 ¼  4e þ 2H2 O ! 2H2 SO4 þ O2 (gas)

ð4:9bÞ

The product H2SO4 is dissociated into ions of H and SO4 ¼ again and so the process continues.
In addition totheproductionofhydrogen andoxygengases,as illustrated bytheexample,
electrolysis is also used in several other industrial processes. Two examples are (1) electroplating (Section 28.3.1), an operation that adds a thin coating of one metal (e.g., chromium) to
the surface of a second metal (e.g., steel) for decorative or other purposes; and (2) electrochemicalmachining (Section26.2),aprocessinwhichmaterialisremoved fromthesurfaceofa
metal part. Both these operations rely on electrolysis to either add or remove material from the
surface of a metal part. In electroplating, the workpart is set up in the electrolytic circuit as the
cathode, so that the positive ions of the coating metal are attracted to the negatively charged
part. In electrochemical machining, the workpart is the anode, and a tool with the desired shape
is the cathode. The action of electrolysis in this setup is to remove metal from the part surface in
regions determined by the shape of the tool as it slowly feeds into the work.
The two physical laws that determine the amount of material deposited or removed
from a metallic surface were first stated by the British scientist Michael Faraday:
+

1. The mass of a substance liberated in an electrolytic cell is proportional to the quantity
of electricity passing through the cell.
2. When the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytic cells, the
masses of the substances liberated are proportional to their chemical equivalents.
Faraday’s laws are used in the subsequent coverage of electroplating and electrochemical machining.

PROBLEMS
4.1. The starting diameter of a shaft is 25.00 mm. This
shaft is to be inserted into a hole in an expansion fit
assembly operation. To be readily inserted, the shaft

copper wire of the same gauge were used to replace
the aluminum wire, what current should the wire be
capable of carrying if all factors except resistivity
are considered equal? Assume that the resistance of
the wire is the primary factor that determines the

5.5 Effect of Manufacturing Processes

In addition to mechanical and physical properties of materials, other factors that determine the performance of a
manufactured product include the dimensions and surfaces
of its components. Dimensions are the linear or angular sizes
of a component specified on the part drawing. Dimensions
are important because they determine how well the components of a product fit together during assembly. When
fabricating a given component, it is nearly impossible and
very costly to make the part to the exact dimension given on
the drawing. Instead a limited variation is allowed from the
dimension, and that allowable variation is called a tolerance.
The surfaces of a component are also important. They
affect product performance, assembly fit, and aesthetic appeal
that a potential customer might have for the product. A
surface is the exterior boundary of an object with its surroundings, which may be another object, a fluid, or space, or
combinations of these. The surface encloses the object’s
bulk mechanical and physical properties.
This chapter discusses dimensions, tolerances, and surfaces—three attributes specified by the product designer and
determined by the manufacturing processes used to make the
parts and products. It also considers how these attributes are
assessed using measuring and gaging devices. A closely related
topic is inspection, covered in Chapter 42.

DIMENSIONS, TOLERANCES,
AND RELATED ATTRIBUTES

sizes of geometric features on a part drawing are defined in

FIGURE 5.1 Three
ways to specify tolerance
limits for a nominal
dimension of 2.500: (a) bilateral, (b) unilateral, and
(c) limit dimensions.

5.1.1 DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES
ANSI [3] defines a dimension as ‘‘a numerical value expressed in appropriate units of
measure and indicated on a drawing and in other documents along with lines, symbols, and
notes to define the size or geometric characteristic, or both, of a part or part feature.’’
Dimensions on part drawings represent nominal or basic sizes of the part and its features. These are
the values that the designer would like the part size to be, if the part could be made to an exact size
with no errors or variations in the fabrication process. However, there are variations in the
manufacturing process, which are manifested as variations in the part size. Tolerances are used to
define the limits of the allowed variation. Quoting again from the ANSI standard [3], a tolerance is
‘‘the total amount by which a specific dimension is permitted to vary. The tolerance is the
difference between the maximum and minimum limits.’’
Tolerances can be specified in several ways, illustrated in Figure 5.1. Probably most
common is the bilateral tolerance, in which the variation is permitted in both positive and
negative directions from the nominal dimension. For example, in Figure 5.1(a), the nominal
dimension ¼ 2.500 linear units (e.g., mm, in), with an allowable variation of 0.005 units in
either direction. Parts outside these limits are unacceptable. It is possible for a bilateral
tolerance to be unbalanced; for example, 2.500 +0.010, –0.005 dimensional units. A
unilateral tolerance is one in which the variation from the specified dimension is permitted
in only one direction, either positive or negative, as in Figure 5.1(b). Limit dimensions are
an alternative method to specify the permissible variation in a part feature size; they consist
of the maximum and minimum dimensions allowed, as in Figure 5.1(c).

5.1.2 OTHER GEOMETRIC ATTRIBUTES
Dimensions and tolerances are normally expressed as linear (length) values. There are
other geometric attributes of parts that are also important, such as flatness of a surface,
roundness of a shaft or hole, parallelism between two surfaces, and so on. Definitions of
these terms are listed in Table 5.1.

5.2

CONVENTIONAL MEASURING INSTRUMENTS AND GAGES
Measurement is a procedure in which an unknown quantity is compared with a known
standard, using an accepted and consistent system of units. Two systems of units have
evolved in the world: (1) the U.S. customary system (U.S.C.S.), and (2) the International
System of Units (or SI, for Systeme Internationale d’Unites), more popularly known as the
metric system. Both systems are used in parallel throughout this book. The metric system
is widely accepted in nearly every part of the industrialized world except the United States,
which has stubbornly clung to its U.S.C.S. Gradually, the United States is adopting SI.
Measurement provides a numerical value of the quantity of interest, within certain
limits of accuracy and precision. Accuracy is the degree to which the measured value agrees
with the true value of the quantity of interest. A measurement procedure is accurate when it is

TABLE 5.1

Definitions of geometric attributes of parts.

Angularity—The extent to which a part feature such
as a surface or axis is at a specified angle relative to
a reference surface. If the angle = 90 , then the
attribute is called perpendicularity or squareness.
Circularity—For a surface of revolution such as a
cylinder, circular hole, or cone, circularity is the
degree to which all points on the intersection of the
surface and a plane perpendicular to the axis of
revolution are equidistant from the axis. For a
sphere, circularity is the degree to which all points
on the intersection of the surface and a plane
passing through the center are equidistant from the
center.
Concentricity—The degree to which any two (or
more) part features such as a cylindrical surface and
a circular hole have a common axis.

Cylindricity—The degree to which all points on a
surface of revolution such as a cylinder are
equidistant from the axis of revolution.
Flatness—The extent to which all points on a surface
lie in a single plane.
Parallelism—The degree to which all points on a
part feature such as a surface, line, or axis are
equidistant from a reference plane or line or axis.
Perpendicularity—The degree to which all points on
a part feature such as a surface, line, or axis are 90
from a reference plane or line or axis.
Roundness—Same as circularity.
Squareness—Same as perpendicularity.
Straightness—The degree to which a part feature
such as a line or axis is a straight line.

absent of systematic errors, which are positive or negative deviations from the true value that
are consistent from one measurement to the next. Precision is the degree of repeatability in
the measurement process. Good precision means that random errors in the measurement
procedure are minimized. Random errors are usually associated with human participation in
the measurement process. Examples include variations in the setup, imprecise reading of
the scale, round-off approximations, and so on. Nonhuman contributors to random error
include temperature changes, gradual wear and/or misalignment in the working elements of
the device, and other variations.
Closely related to measurement is gaging. Gaging (also spelled gauging) determines
simply whether the part characteristic meets or does not meet the design specification. It is
usually faster than measuring, but scant information is provided about the actual value of
the characteristic of interest. The video clip on measurement and gaging illustrates some of
the topics discussed in this chapter.
VIDEO CLIP
Measurement and Gaging. This clip contains three segments: (1) precision, resolution,
and accuracy, (2) how to read a vernier caliper, and (3) how to read a micrometer.

This section considers the variety of manually operated measuring instruments and gages
used to evaluate dimensions such as length and diameter, as well as features such as angles,
straightness, and roundness. This type of equipment is found in metrology labs, inspection
departments, and tool rooms. The logical starting topic is precision gage blocks.

5.2.1 PRECISION GAGE BLOCKS
Precision gage blocks are the standards against which other dimensional measuring instrumentsandgages are compared. Gageblocks are usuallysquare or rectangular. Themeasuring
surfaces are finished to be dimensionally accurate and parallel to within several millionths of
an inch and are polished to a mirror finish. Several grades of precision gage blocks are
available, with closer tolerances for higher precision grades. The highest grade—the master
laboratory standard—is made to a tolerance of 0.000,03 mm (0.000,001 in). Depending

on degree of hardness desired and price the user is willing to pay, gage blocks can be made out
of any of several hard materials, including tool steel, chrome-plated steel, chromium carbide,
or tungsten carbide.
Precision gage blocks are available in certain standard sizes or in sets, the latter
containing a variety of different-sized blocks. The sizes in a set are systematically determined so they can be stacked to achieve virtually any dimension desired to within 0.0025 mm
(0.0001 in).
For best results, gage blocks must be used on a flat reference surface, such as a surface
plate. A surface plate is a large solid block whose top surface is finished to a flat plane. Most
surface plates today are made of granite. Granite has the advantage of being hard, nonrusting, nonmagnetic, long wearing, thermally stable, and easy to maintain.
Gage blocks and other high-precision measuring instruments must be used under
standard conditions of temperature and other factors that might adversely affect the
measurement. By international agreement, 20 C (68 F) has been established as the standard
temperature. Metrology labs operate at this standard. If gage blocks or other measuring
instruments are used in a factory environment in which the temperature differs from this
standard, corrections for thermal expansion or contraction may be required. Also, working
gage blocks used for inspection in the shop are subject to wear and must be calibrated
periodically against more precise laboratory gage blocks.

5.2.2 MEASURING INSTRUMENTS FOR LINEAR DIMENSIONS
Measuring instruments can be divided into two types: graduated and nongraduated.
Graduated measuring devices include a set of markings (called graduations) on a linear
or angular scale to which the object’s feature of interest can be compared for measurement.
Nongraduated measuring devices possess no such scale and are used to make comparisons
between dimensions or to transfer a dimension for measurement by a graduated device.
The most basic of the graduated measuring devices is the rule (made of steel, and
often called a steel rule), used to measure linear dimensions. Rules are available in various
lengths. Metric rule lengths include 150, 300, 600, and 1000 mm, with graduations of 1 or 0.5
mm. Common U.S. sizes are 6, 12, and 24 in, with graduations of 1/32, 1/64, or 1/100 in.
Calipers are available in either nongraduated or graduated styles. A nongraduated
caliper (referred to simply as a caliper) consists of two legs joined by a hinge mechanism, as in
Figure 5.2. The ends of the legs are made to contact the surfaces of the object being measured,

and the hinge is designed to hold the legs in position during use. The contacts point either
inward or outward. When they point inward, as in Figure 5.2, the instrument is an outside
caliper and is used for measuring outside dimensions such as a diameter. When the contacts
point outward, it is an inside caliper, which is used to measure the distance between two
internal surfaces. An instrument similar in configuration to the caliper is a divider, except that
both legs are straight and terminate in hard, sharply pointed contacts. Dividers are used for
scaling distances between two points or lines on a surface, and for scribing circles or arcs onto
a surface.
A variety of graduated calipers are available for various measurement purposes. The
simplest is the slide caliper, which consists of a steel rule to which two jaws are added, one
fixed at the end of the rule and the other movable, shown in Figure 5.3. Slide calipers can be
used for inside or outside measurements, depending on whether the inside or outside jaw
faces are used. In use, the jaws are forced into contact with the part surfaces to be measured,
and the location of the movable jaw indicates the dimension of interest. Slide calipers permit
more accurate and precise measurements than simple rules. A refinement of the slide caliper
is the vernier caliper, shown in Figure 5.4. In this device, the movable jaw includes a vernier
scale, named after P. Vernier (1580–1637), a French mathematician who invented it. The
vernier provides graduations of 0.01 mm in the SI (and 0.001 inch in the U.S. customary scale),
much more precise than the slide caliper.
The micrometer is a widely used and very accurate measuring device, the most
common form of which consists of a spindle and a C-shaped anvil, as in Figure 5.5. The
spindle is moved relative to the fixed anvil by means of an accurate screw thread. On a
typical U.S. micrometer, each rotation of the spindle provides 0.025 in of linear travel.
Attached to the spindle is a thimble graduated with 25 marks around its circumference, each
mark corresponding to 0.001 in. The micrometer sleeve is usually equipped with a vernier,

allowing resolutions as close as 0.0001 in. On a micrometer with metric scale, graduations are
0.01 mm. Modern micrometers (and graduated calipers) are available with electronic
devices that display a digital readout of the measurement (as in the figure). These instruments are easier to read and eliminate much of the human error associated with reading
conventional graduated devices.
The most common micrometer types are (1) external micrometer, Figure 5.5, also
called an outside micrometer, which comes in a variety of standard anvil sizes; (2) internal
micrometer, or inside micrometer, which consists of a head assembly and a set of rods
of different lengths to measure various inside dimensions that might be encountered;
and (3) depth micrometer, similar to an inside micrometer but adapted to measure hole
depths.

5.2.3 COMPARATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Comparative instruments are used to make dimensional comparisons between two objects,
such as a workpart and a reference surface. They are usually not capable of providing an
absolute measurement of the quantity of interest; instead, they measure the magnitude and
direction of the deviation between two objects. Instruments in this category include
mechanical and electronic gages.
Mechanical Gages: Dial Indicators Mechanical gages are designed to mechanically
magnify the deviation to permit observation. The most common instrument in this category
is the dial indicator (Figure 5.6), which converts and amplifies the linear movement of a
contact pointer into rotation of a dial needle. The dial is graduated in small units such as 0.01
mm (or 0.001 in). Dial indicators are used in many applications to measure straightness,
flatness, parallelism, squareness, roundness, and runout. A typical setup for measuring
runout is illustrated in Figure 5.7.
Electronic Gages Electronic gages are a family of measuring and gaging instruments
based on transducers capable of converting a linear displacement into an electrical signal. The
electrical signal is then amplified and transformed into a suitable data format such as a digital
readout, as in Figure 5.5. Applications of electronic gages have grown rapidly in recent years,
driven by advances in microprocessor technology. They are gradually replacing many of the
conventional measuring and gaging devices. Advantages of electronic gages include (1) good
sensitivity, accuracy, precision, repeatability, and speed of response; (2) ability to sense
very small dimensions—down to 0.025 mm (1 m-in.); (3) ease of operation; (4) reduced

human error; (5) electrical signal that can be displayed in various formats; and
(6) capability to be interfaced with computer systems for data processing.

5.2.4 FIXED GAGES
A fixed gage is a physical replica of the part dimension to be assessed. There are two basic
categories: master gage and limit gage. A master gage is fabricated to be a direct replica of the
nominal size of the part dimension. It is generally used for setting up a comparative
measuring instrument, such as a dial indicator; or for calibrating a measuring device.
A limit gage is fabricated to be a reverse replica of the part dimension and is designed
to check the dimension at one or more of its tolerance limits. A limit gage often consists of
two gages in one piece, the first for checking the lower limit of the tolerance on the part
dimension, and the other for checking the upper limit. These gages are popularly known as
GO/NO-GO gages, because one gage limit allows the part to be inserted, whereas the other
limit does not. The GO limit is used to check the dimension at its maximum material
condition; this is the minimum size for an internal feature such as a hole, and it is the
maximum size for an external feature such as an outside diameter. The NO-GO limit is used
to inspect the minimum material condition of the dimension in question.
Common limit gages are snap gages and ring gages for checking outside part dimensions, and plug gages for checking inside dimensions. A snap gage consists of a C-shaped
frame with gaging surfaces located in the jaws of the frame, as in Figure 5.8. It has two gage
buttons, the first being the GO gage, and the second being the NO-GO gage. Snap gages are
used for checking outside dimensions such as diameter, width, thickness, and similar surfaces.
Ring gages are used for checking cylindrical diameters. For a given application, a pair of
gages is usually required, one GO and the other NO-GO. Each gage is a ring whose opening is
machined to one of the tolerance limits of the part diameter. For ease of handling, the outside
of the ring is knurled. The two gages are distinguished by the presence of a groove around the
outside of the NO-GO ring.
The most common limit gage for checking hole diameter is the plug gage. The typical
gage consists of a handle to which are attached two accurately ground cylindrical pieces
(plugs) of hardened steel, as in Figure 5.9. The cylindrical plugs serve as the GO and NO-GO

FIGURE 5.8 Snap gage for
measuring diameter of a part;
difference in height of GO and NOGO gage buttons is exaggerated.

gages. Other gages similar to the plug gage include taper gages, consisting of a tapered plug
for checking tapered holes; and thread gages, in which the plug is threaded for checking
internal threads on parts.
Fixed gages are easy to use, and the time required to complete an inspection is almost
always less than when a measuring instrument is employed. Fixed gages were a fundamental
element in the development of interchangeable parts manufacturing (Historical Note 1.1).
They provided the means by which parts could be made to tolerances that were sufficiently
close for assembly without filing and fitting. Their disadvantage is that they provide little if
any information on the actual part size; they only indicate whether the size is within
tolerance. Today, with the availability of high-speed electronic measuring instruments, and
with the need for statistical process control of part sizes, use of gages is gradually giving way
to instruments that provide actual measurements of the dimension of interest.

5.2.5 ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS
Angles can be measured using any of several styles of protractor. A simple protractor consists
of a blade that pivots relative to a semicircular head that is graduated in angular units (e.g.,
degrees, radians). To use, the blade is rotated to a position corresponding to some part angle
to be measured, and the angle is read off the angular scale. A bevel protractor (Figure 5.10)
consists of two straight blades that pivot relative to each other. The pivot assembly has a
protractor scale that permits the angle formed by the blades to be read. When equipped with a
vernier, the bevel protractor can be read to about 5 min; without a vernier the resolution is
only about 1 degree.
High precision in angular measurements can be made using a sine bar, illustrated in
Figure 5.11. One possible setup consists of a flat steel straight edge (the sine bar), and two
precision rolls set a known distance apart on the bar. The straight edge is aligned with the part
angle to be measured, and gage blocks or other accurate linear measurements are made to
determine height. The procedure is carried out on a surface plate to achieve most accurate
results. This height H and the length L of the sine bar between rolls are used to calculate the
angle A using
sin A ¼

SURFACES
A surface is what one touches when holding an object, such as a manufactured part. The
designer specifies the part dimensions, relating the various surfaces to each other. These
nominal surfaces, representing the intended surface contour of the part, are defined by lines
in the engineering drawing. The nominal surfaces appear as absolutely straight lines, ideal
circles, round holes, and other edges and surfaces that are geometrically perfect. The actual
surfaces of a manufactured part are determined by the processes used to make it. The variety
of processes available in manufacturing result in wide variations in surface characteristics,
and it is important for engineers to understand the technology of surfaces.
Surfaces are commercially and technologically important for a number of reasons,
different reasons for different applications: (1) Aesthetic reasons—surfaces that are smooth
and free of scratches and blemishes are more likely to give a favorable impression to the
customer. (2) Surfaces affect safety. (3) Friction and wear depend on surface characteristics. (4) Surfaces affect mechanical and physical properties; for example, surface flaws
can be points of stress concentration. (5) Assembly of parts is affected by their surfaces; for
example, the strength of adhesively bonded joints (Section 31.3) is increased when the
surfaces are slightly rough. (6) Smooth surfaces make better electrical contacts.
Surface technology is concerned with (1) defining the characteristics of a surface,
(2) surface texture, (3) surface integrity, and (4) the relationship between manufacturing
processes and the characteristics of the resulting surface. The first three topics are covered
in this section; the final topic is presented in Section 5.5.

5.3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF SURFACES
A microscopic view of a part’s surface reveals its irregularities and imperfections. The
features of a typical surface are illustrated in the highly magnified cross section of the surface
of a metal part in Figure 5.12. Although the discussion here is focused on metallic surfaces,

Chapter 5/Dimensions, Surfaces, and their Measurement

these comments apply to ceramics and polymers, with modifications owing to differences in
structure of these materials. The bulk of the part, referred to as the substrate, has a grain
structure that depends on previous processing of the metal; for example, the metal’s substrate
structure is affected by its chemical composition, the casting process originally used on the
metal, and any deformation operations and heat treatments performed on the casting.
The exterior of the part is a surface whose topography is anything but straight and
smooth. In this highly magnified cross section, the surface has roughness, waviness, and
flaws. Although not shown here, it also possesses a pattern and/or direction resulting from
the mechanical process that produced it. All of these geometric features are included in the
term surface texture.
Just below the surface is a layer of metal whose structure differs from that of the
substrate. This is called the altered layer, and it is a manifestation of the actions that have
been visited upon the surface during its creation and afterward. Manufacturing processes
involve energy, usually in large amounts, which operates on the part against its surface. The
altered layer may result from work hardening (mechanical energy), heating (thermal
energy), chemical treatment, or even electrical energy. The metal in this layer is affected
by the application of energy, and its microstructure is altered accordingly. This altered layer
falls within the scope of surface integrity, which is concerned with the definition, specification, and control of the surface layers of a material (most commonly metals) in manufacturing and subsequent performance in service. The scope of surface integrity is usually
interpreted to include surface texture as well as the altered layer beneath.
In addition, most metal surfaces are coated with an oxide film, given sufficient time
after processing for the film to form. Aluminum forms a hard, dense, thin film of Al2O3 on its
surface (which serves to protect the substrate from corrosion), and iron forms oxides of several
chemistries on its surface (rust, which provides virtually no protection at all). There is also
likely to be moisture, dirt, oil, adsorbed gases, and other contaminants on the part’s surface.

5.3.2 SURFACE TEXTURE
Surface texture consists of the repetitive and/or random deviations from the nominal surface
of an object; it is defined by four features: roughness, waviness, lay, and flaws, shown in
Figure 5.13. Roughness refers to the small, finely spaced deviations from the nominal surface
that are determined by the material characteristics and the process that formed the surface.
Waviness is defined as the deviations of much larger spacing; they occur because of work

texture features.

deflection, vibration, heat treatment, and similar factors. Roughness is superimposed on
waviness. Lay is the predominant direction or pattern of the surface texture. It is determined by
the manufacturing method used to create the surface, usually from the action of a cutting tool.
Figure 5.14 presents most of the possible lays a surface can take, together with the symbol used
by a designer to specify them. Finally, flaws are irregularities that occur occasionally on the
surface; these include cracks, scratches, inclusions, and similar defects in the surface. Although
some of the flaws relate to surface texture, they also affect surface integrity (Section 5.2.3).
Surface Roughness and Surface Finish Surface roughness is a measurable characteristic based on the roughness deviations as defined in the preceding. Surface finish is a more
subjective term denoting smoothness and general quality of a surface. In popular usage,
surface finish is often used as a synonym for surface roughness.
The most commonly used measure of surface texture is surface roughness. With
respect to Figure 5.15, surface roughness can be defined as the average of the vertical
deviations from the nominal surface over a specified surface length. An arithmetic average
(AA) is generally used, based on the absolute values of the deviations, and this roughness
value is referred to by the name average roughness. In equation form

where Ra ¼ arithmetic mean value of roughness, m (in); y ¼ the vertical deviation from
nominal surface (converted to absolute value), m (in); and Lm ¼ the specified distance over
which the surface deviations are measured.

An approximation of Eq. (5.2), perhaps easier to comprehend, is given by
Ra ¼

where Ra has the same meaning as above; yi ¼ vertical deviations converted to absolute
value and identified by the subscript i, m (in); and n ¼ the number of deviations included in
Lm. The units in these equations are meters and inches.
In fact, the scale of the deviations is very small, so more appropriate units are mm
(mm ¼ m  106 ¼ mm  103) or m-in (m-in ¼ inch  106). These are the units commonly
used to express surface roughness.
The AA method is the most widely used averaging method for surface roughness
today. An alternative, sometimes used in the United States, is the root-mean-square (RMS)
average, which is the square root of the mean of the squared deviations over the measuring
length. RMS surface roughness values will almost always be greater than the AA values
because the larger deviations will figure more prominently in the calculation of the RMS
value.
Surface roughness suffers the same kinds of deficiencies of any single measure used to
assess a complex physical attribute. For example, it fails to account for the lay of the surface
pattern; thus, surface roughness may vary significantly, depending on the direction in which
it is measured.
Another deficiency is that waviness can be included in the Ra computation. To deal
with this problem, a parameter called the cutoff length is used as a filter that separates the
waviness in a measured surface from the roughness deviations. In effect, the cutoff length is a
sampling distance along the surface. A sampling distance shorter than the waviness width
will eliminate the vertical deviations associated with waviness and only include those
associated with roughness. The most common cutoff length used in practice is 0.8 mm (0.030
in). The measuring length Lm is normally set at about five times the cutoff length.
The limitations of surface roughness have motivated the development of additional
measures that more completely describe the topography of a given surface. These measures
include three-dimensional graphical renderings of the surface, as described in [17].
Symbols for Surface Texture Designers specify surface texture on an engineering
drawing by means of symbols as in Figure 5.16. The symbol designating surface texture
parameters is a check mark (looks like a square root sign), with entries as indicated for
average roughness, waviness, cutoff, lay, and maximum roughness spacing. The symbols
for lay are from Figure 5.14.

FIGURE 5.16 Surface texture symbols in engineering drawings: (a) the symbol, and (b) symbol with
identification labels. Values of Ra are given in microinches; units for other measures are given in inches.
Designers do not always specify all of the parameters on engineering drawings.

5.3.3 SURFACE INTEGRITY
Surface texture alone does not completely describe a surface. There may be metallurgical or
other changes in the material immediately beneath the surface that can have a significant
effect on its mechanical properties. Surface integrity is the study and control of this
subsurface layer and any changes in it because of processing that may influence the
performance of the finished part or product. This subsurface layer was previously referred
to as the altered layer when its structure differs from the substrate, as in Figure 5.12.
The possible alterations and injuries to the subsurface layer that can occur in
manufacturing are listed in Table 5.2. The surface changes are caused by the application
of various forms of energy during processing—mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical.
Mechanical energy is the most common form used in manufacturing; it is applied against the
work material in operations such as metal forming (e.g., forging, extrusion), pressworking,
and machining. Although its primary function in these processes is to change the geometry of
the workpart, mechanical energy can also cause residual stresses, work hardening, and cracks

Surface and subsurface alterations that define surface integrity.a

Absorption are impurities that are absorbed and
retained in surface layers of the base material,
possibly leading to embrittlement or other
property changes.
Alloy depletion occurs when critical alloying
elements are lost from the surface layers, with
possible loss of properties in the metal.
Cracks are narrow ruptures or separations either at
or below the surface that alter the continuity of the
material. Cracks are characterized by sharp edges
and length-to-width ratios of 4:1 or more. They are
classified as macroscopic (can be observed with
magnification of 10 or less) and microscopic
(requires magnification of more than 10).
Craters are rough surface depressions left in the
surface by short circuit discharges; associated with
electrical processing methods such as electric
discharge machining and electrochemical
machining (Chapter 26).
Hardness changes refer to hardness differences at or
near the surface.
Heat affected zone are regions of the metal that are
affected by the application of thermal energy; the
regions are not melted but are sufficiently heated
that they undergo metallurgical changes that affect
properties. Abbreviated HAZ, the effect is most
prominent in fusion welding operations
(Chapter 31).
Inclusions are small particles of material
incorporated into the surface layers during
processing; they are a discontinuity in the base
material. Their composition usually differs from
the base material.

Intergranular attack refers to various forms of
chemical reactions at the surface, including
intergranular corrosion and oxidation.
Laps, folds, seams are irregularities and defects in
the surface caused by plastic working of
overlapping surfaces.
Pits are shallow depressions with rounded edges
formed by any of several mechanisms, including
selective etching or corrosion; removal of surface

Redeposited metal is metal that is removed from the
surface in the molten state and then reattached

material after processing.

in the surface layers. Table 5.3 indicates the various types of surface and subsurface alterations
that are attributable to the different forms of energy applied in manufacturing. Most of the
alterations in the table refer to metals, for which surface integrity has been most intensively
studied.

5.4

MEASUREMENT OF SURFACES
Surfaces are described as consisting of two parameters: (1) surface texture and (2) surface
integrity. This section is concerned with the measurement of these two parameters.

5.4.1 MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS
Various methods are used to assess surface roughness. They can be divided into three
categories: (1) subjective comparison with standard test surfaces, (2) stylus electronic
instruments, and (3) optical techniques.
Standard Test Surfaces Sets of standard surface finish blocks are available, produced to
specified roughness values.1 To estimate the roughness of a given test specimen, the surface is
compared with the standard both visually and by the ‘‘fingernail test.’’ In this test, the user
gently scratches the surfaces of the specimen and the standards, judging which standard is closest to
the specimen. Standard test surfaces are a convenient way for a machine operator to obtain an
estimate of surface roughness. They are also useful for design engineers in judging what value of
surface roughness to specify on a part drawing.
Stylus Instruments The disadvantage of the fingernail test is its subjectivity. Several
stylus-type instruments are commercially available to measure surface roughness—similar to
1

In the U.S.C.S., these blocks have surfaces with roughness values of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 microinches.

the fingernail test, but more scientific. An example is the Profilometer, shown in Figure 5.17.
In these electronic devices, a cone-shaped diamond stylus with point radius of about 0.005
mm (0.0002 in) and 90 tip angle is traversed across the test surface at a constant slow speed.
The operation is depicted in Figure 5.18. As the stylus head is traversed horizontally, it also
moves vertically to follow the surface deviations. The vertical movement is converted into an
electronic signal that represents the topography of the surface. This can be displayed as either
a profile of the actual surface or an average roughness value. Profiling devices use a separate
flat plane as the nominal reference against which deviations are measured. The output is a
plot of the surface contour along the line traversed by the stylus. This type of system can
identify both roughness and waviness in the test surface. Averaging devices reduce the
roughness deviations to a single value Ra. They use skids riding on the actual surface to
establish the nominal reference plane. The skids act as a mechanical filter to reduce the effect
of waviness in the surface; in effect, these averaging devices electronically perform the
computations in Eq. (5.1).
Optical Techniques Most other surface-measuring instruments employ optical techniques to assess roughness. These techniques are based on light reflectance from the surface,
light scatter or diffusion, and laser technology. They are useful in applications where stylus
contact with the surface is undesirable. Some of the techniques permit very-high-speed
operation, thus making 100% inspection feasible. However, the optical techniques yield
values that do not always correlate well with roughness measurements made by stylus-type
instruments.

5.4.2 EVALUATION OF SURFACE INTEGRITY
Surface integrity is more difficult to assess than surface roughness. Some of the techniques
to inspect for subsurface changes are destructive to the material specimen. Evaluation
techniques for surface integrity include the following:
å Surface texture. Surface roughness, designation of lay, and other measures provide
superficial data on surface integrity. This type of testing is relatively simple to perform
and is always included in the evaluation of surface integrity.
å Visual examination. Visual examination can reveal various surface flaws such as
cracks, craters, laps, and seams. This type of assessment is often augmented by fluorescent
and photographic techniques.
å Microstructural examination. This involves standard metallographic techniques for
preparing cross sections and obtaining photomicrographs for examination of microstructure in the surface layers compared with the substrate.
å Microhardness profile. Hardness differences near the surface can be detected using
microhardness measurement techniques such as Knoop and Vickers (Section 3.2.1).
The part is sectioned, and hardness is plotted against distance below the surface to
obtain a hardness profile of the cross section.
å Residual stress profile. X-ray diffraction techniques can be employed to measure
residual stresses in the surface layers of a part.

EFFECT OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
The ability to achieve a certain tolerance or surface is a function of the manufacturing
process. This section describes the general capabilities of various processes in terms of
tolerance and surface roughness and surface integrity.
Some manufacturing processes are inherently more accurate than others.
Most machining processes are quite accurate, capable of tolerances of 0.05 mm (0.002
in) or better. By contrast, sand castings are generally inaccurate, and tolerances of 10 to
20 times those used for machined parts should be specified. Table 5.4 lists a variety of
manufacturing processes and indicates the typical tolerances for each process. Tolerances are

based on the process capability for the particular manufacturing operation, as defined in
Section 42.2. The tolerance that should be specified is a function of part size; larger parts
require more generous tolerances. The table lists tolerance for moderately sized parts in each
processing category.
The manufacturing process determines surface finish and surface integrity. Some
processes are capable of producing better surfaces than others. In general, processing
cost increases with improvement in surface finish. This is because additional operations
and more time are usually required to obtain increasingly better surfaces. Processes noted
for providing superior finishes include honing, lapping, polishing, and superfinishing (Chapter 25). Table 5.5 indicates the usual surface roughness that can be expected from various
manufacturing processes.

Part II discusses the four types of engineering materials:

(1) metals, (2) ceramics, (3) polymers, and (4) composites. Metals are the most important engineering materials and the topic of this chapter. A metal is a category of
materials generally characterized by properties of ductility, malleability, luster, and high electrical and thermal
conductivity. The category includes both metallic elements and their alloys. Metals have properties that
satisfy a wide variety of design requirements. The manufacturing processes by which they are shaped into
products have been developed and refined over many
years; indeed, some of the processes date from ancient
times (Historical Note 1.2). In addition, the properties of
metals can be enhanced through heat treatment (covered in Chapter 27).
The technological and commercial importance of metals results from the following general properties possessed
by virtually all of the common metals:
å High stiffness and strength. Metals can be alloyed
for high rigidity, strength, and hardness; thus, they
are used to provide the structural framework for
most engineered products.
å Toughness. Metals have the capacity to absorb
energy better than other classes of materials.
å Good electrical conductivity. Metals are conductors because of their metallic bonding that permits
the free movement of electrons as charge carriers.
å Good thermal conductivity. Metallic bonding also
explains why metals generally conduct heat better
than ceramics or polymers.

In addition, certain metals have specific properties that make them attractive for
specialized applications. Many common metals are available at relatively low cost per
unit weight and are often the material of choice simply because of their low cost.
Metals are converted into parts and products using a variety of manufacturing
processes. The starting form of the metal differs, depending on the process. The major
categories are (1) cast metal, in which the initial form is a casting; (2) wrought metal, in

which the metal has been worked or can be worked (e.g., rolled or otherwise formed)
after casting; better mechanical properties are generally associated with wrought
metals compared with cast metals; and (3) powdered metal, in which the metal is
purchased in the form of very small powders for conversion into parts using powder
metallurgy techniques. Most metals are available in all three forms. The discussion in
this chapter focuses on categories (1) and (2), which are of greatest commercial and
engineering interest. Powder metallurgy techniques are examined in Chapter 16.
Metals are classified into two major groups: (1) ferrous—those based on iron; and
(2) nonferrous—all other metals. The ferrous group can be further subdivided into
steels and cast irons. Most of the discussion in the present chapter is organized around
this classification, but first the general topic of alloys and phase diagrams is examined.

6.1

ALLOYS AND PHASE DIAGRAMS
Although some metals are important as pure elements (e.g., gold, silver, copper), most
engineering applications require the improved properties obtained by alloying. Through
alloying, it is possible to enhance strength, hardness, and other properties compared with
pure metals. This section defines and classifies alloys; it then discusses phase diagrams,
which indicate the phases of an alloy system as a function of composition and temperature.

6.1.1 ALLOYS
An alloy is a metal composed of two or more elements, at least one of which is metallic. The
two main categories of alloys are (1) solid solutions and (2) intermediate phases.

Solid Solutions A solid solution is an alloy in which one element is dissolved in another to
form a single-phase structure. The term phase describes any homogeneous mass of material,
such as a metal in which the grains all have the same crystal lattice structure. In a solid
solution, the solvent or base element is metallic, and the dissolved element can be either
metallic or nonmetallic. Solid solutions come in two forms, shown in Figure 6.1. The first is a
substitutional solid solution, in which atoms of the solvent element are replaced in its unit
cell by the dissolved element. Brass is an example, in which zinc is dissolved in copper. To
make the substitution, several rules must be satisfied [3], [6], [7]: (1) the atomic radii of the
two elements must be similar, usually within 15%; (2) their lattice types must be the

FIGURE 6.1 Two forms of solid solutions:
(a) substitutional solid solution, and (b) interstitial solid solution.

same; (3) if the elements have different valences, the lower valence metal is more
likely to be the solvent; and (4) if the elements have high chemical affinity for each
other, they are less likely to form a solid solution and more likely to form a compound.
The second type of solid solution is an interstitial solid solution, in which atoms of
the dissolving element fit into the vacant spaces between base metal atoms in the lattice
structure. It follows that the atoms fitting into these interstices must be small compared
with those of the solvent metal. The most important example of this second type is carbon
dissolved in iron to form steel.
In both forms of solid solution, the alloy structure is generally stronger and harder
than either of the component elements.
Intermediate Phases There are usually limits to the solubility of one element in another.
When the amount of the dissolving element in the alloy exceeds the solid solubility limit of the
base metal, a second phase forms in the alloy. The term intermediate phase is used to describe
it because its chemical composition is intermediate between the two pure elements. Its
crystalline structure is also different from those of the pure metals. Depending on composition, and recognizing that many alloys consist of more than two elements, these intermediate
phases can be of several types, including (1) metallic compounds consisting of a metal and
nonmetal such as Fe3C; and (2) intermetallic compounds—two metals that form a
compound, such as Mg2Pb. 6pt?>The composition of the alloy is often such that the
intermediate phase is mixed with the primary solid solution to form a two-phase
structure, one phase dispersed throughout the second. These two-phase alloys are
important because they can be formulated and heat treated for significantly higher
strength than solid solutions.

6.1.2 PHASE DIAGRAMS
As the term is used in this text, a phase diagram is a graphical means of representing the
phases of a metal alloy system as a function of composition and temperature. This
discussion of the diagram will be limited to alloy systems consisting of two elements at
atmospheric pressures. This type of diagram is called a binary phase diagram. Other
forms of phase diagrams are discussed in texts on materials science, such as [6].

The Copper–Nickel Alloy System The best way to introduce the phase diagram is by
example. Figure 6.2 presents one of the simplest cases, the Cu–Ni alloy system. Composition is plotted on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. Thus, any
point in the diagram indicates the overall composition and the phase or phases present at
the given temperature. Pure copper melts at 1083 C (1981 F), and pure nickel at 1455 C
(2651 F). Alloy compositions between these extremes exhibit gradual melting that
commences at the solidus and concludes at the liquidus as temperature is increased.
The copper–nickel system is a solid solution alloy throughout its entire range of
compositions. Anywhere in the region below the solidus line, the alloy is a solid solution;
there are no intermediate solid phases in this system. However, there is a mixture of phases
in the region bounded by the solidus and liquidus. Recall from Chapter 4 that the solidus is
the temperature at which the solid metal begins to melt as temperature is increased, and the
liquidus is the temperature at which melting is completed. It can now be seen from the
phase diagram that these temperatures vary with composition. Between the solidus and
liquidus, the metal is a solid–liquid mix.
Determining Chemical Compositions of Phases Although the overall composition
of the alloy is given by its position along the horizontal axis, the compositions of the liquid

and solid phases are not the same. It is possible to determine these compositions from the
phase diagram by drawing a horizontal line at the temperature of interest. The points of
intersection between the horizontal line and the solidus and liquidus indicate the compositions of the solid and liquid phases present, respectively. Simply construct the vertical
projections from the intersection points to the x-axis and read the corresponding
compositions.

Example 6.1
Determining
Compositions
from the Phase
Diagram

To illustrate the procedure, suppose one wants to analyze the compositions of the
liquid and solid phases present in the copper-nickel system at an aggregate composition of 50% nickel and a temperature of 1260 C (2300 F).
Solution: A horizontal line is drawn at the given temperature level as shown in
Figure 6.2. The line intersects the solidus at a composition of 62% nickel, thus
indicating the composition of the solid phase. The intersection with the liquidus occurs
n
at a composition of 36% Ni, corresponding to the analysis of the liquid phase.
As the temperature of the 50–50 Cu–Ni alloy is reduced, the solidus line is reached at
about 1221 C (2230 F). Applying the same procedure used in the example, the composition
of the solid metal is 50% nickel, and the composition of the last remaining liquid to freeze is
about 26% nickel. How is it, the reader might ask, that the last ounce of molten metal has a
composition so different from the solid metal into which it freezes? The answer is that the
phase diagram assumes equilibrium conditions are allowed to prevail. In fact, the binary
phase diagram is sometimes called an equilibrium diagram because of this assumption.
What it means is that enough time is permitted for the solid metal to gradually change its
composition by diffusion to achieve the composition indicated by the intersection point
along the liquidus. In practice, when an alloy freezes (e.g., a casting), segregation occurs in
the solid mass because of nonequilibrium conditions. The first liquid to solidify has a
composition that is rich in the metal element with the higher melting point. Then as
additional metal solidifies, its composition is different from that of the first metal to freeze.
As the nucleation sites grow into a solid mass, compositions are distributed within the mass,
depending on the temperature and time in the process at which freezing occurred. The
overall composition is the average of the distribution.

Determining Amounts of Each Phase The amounts of each phase present at a given
temperature from the phase diagram can also be determined. This is done by the inverse
lever rule: (1) using the same horizontal line as before that indicates the overall composition
at a given temperature, measure the distances between the aggregate composition and the
intersection points with the liquidus and solidus, identifying the distances as CL and CS,
respectively (refer back to Figure 6.2); (2) the proportion of liquid phase present is given by

Determine the proportions of liquid and solid phases for the 50% nickel composition
of the copper–nickel system at the temperature of 1260 C (2300 F).
Solution: Using the same horizontal line in Figure 6.2 as in previous Example
6.1, the distances CS and CL are measured as 10 mm and 12 mm, respectively. Thus
the proportion of the liquid phase is 10=22 ¼ 0.45 (45%), and the proportion of
n
solid phase is 12=22 ¼ 0.55 (55%).
The proportions given by Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2) are by weight, same as the phase diagram
percentages. Note that the proportions are based on the distance on the opposite side of the
phase of interest; hence the name inverse lever rule. One can see the logic in this by taking the
extreme case when, say, CS ¼ 0; at that point, the proportion of the liquid phase is zero
because the solidus has been reached and the alloy is therefore completely solidified.
The methods for determining chemical compositions of phases and the amounts of each
phase are applicable to the solid region of the phase diagram as well as the liquidus–solidus
region. Wherever there are regions in the phase diagram in which two phases are present,
these methods can be used. When only one phase is present (in Figure 6.2, this is the entire
solid region), the composition of the phase is its aggregate composition under equilibrium
conditions; and the inverse lever rule does not apply because there is only one phase.

The Tin–Lead Alloy System A more complicated phase diagram is the Sn–Pb system,
shown in Figure 6.3. Tin–lead alloys have traditionally been used as solders for making
electrical and mechanical connections (Section 31.2).1 The phase diagram exhibits
several features not included in the previous Cu–Ni system. One feature is the presence
of two solid phases, alpha (a) and beta (b). The a phase is a solid solution of tin in lead at
the left side of the diagram, and the b phase is a solid solution of lead in tin that occurs
only at elevated temperatures around 200 C (375 F) at the right side of the diagram.
Between these solid solutions lies a mixture of the two solid phases, a þ b.
Another feature of interest in the tin–lead system is how melting differs for different
compositions. Pure tin melts at 232 C (449 F), and pure lead melts at 327 C (621 F). Alloys
of these elements melt at lower temperatures. The diagram shows two liquidus lines that
begin at the melting points of the pure metals and meet at a composition of 61.9% Sn. This is
the eutectic composition for the tin–lead system. In general, a eutectic alloy is a particular
composition in an alloy system for which the solidus and liquidus are at the same
temperature. The corresponding eutectic temperature, the melting point of the eutectic

Because lead is a poisonous substance, alternative alloying elements have been substituted for lead in
many commercial solders. These are called lead-free solders.

composition, is 183 C (362 F) in the present case. The eutectic temperature is always the
lowest melting point for an alloy system (eutectic is derived from the Greek word eutektos,
meaning easily melted).
Methods for determining the chemical analysis of the phases and the proportions of
phases present can be readily applied to the Sn–Pb system just as it was used in the Cu–Ni
system. In fact, these methods are applicable in any region containing two phases, including
two solid phases. Most alloy systems are characterized by the existence of multiple solid
phases and eutectic compositions, and so the phase diagrams of these systems are often
similar to the tin–lead diagram. Of course, many alloy systems are considerably more
complex. One of these is the alloy system of iron and carbon.

FERROUS METALS
The ferrous metals are based on iron, one of the oldest metals known to humans (Historical
Note 6.1). The properties and other data relating to iron are listed in Table 6.1(a). The
ferrous metals of engineering importance are alloys of iron and carbon. These alloys divide
into two major groups: steel and cast iron. Together, they constitute approximately 85% of
the metal tonnage in the United States [6]. This discussion of the ferrous metals begins with
the iron–carbon phase diagram.

Iron and steel

ron was discovered sometime during the Bronze Age. It
was probably uncovered from ashes of fires built near
iron ore deposits. Use of the metal grew, finally
surpassing bronze in importance. The Iron Age is usually
dated from about 1200 BCE, although artifacts made of
iron have been found in the Great Pyramid of Giza in
Egypt, which dates to 2900 BCE. Iron-smelting furnaces
have been discovered in Israel dating to 1300 BCE. Iron
chariots, swords, and tools were made in ancient Assyria
(northern Iraq) around 1000 BCE. The Romans inherited
ironworking from their provinces, mainly Greece, and
they developed the technology to new heights, spreading
it throughout Europe. The ancient civilizations learned
that iron was harder than bronze and that it took a
sharper, stronger edge.
During the Middle Ages in Europe, the invention of
the cannon created the first real demand for iron; only
then did it finally exceed copper and bronze in usage.
Also, the cast iron stove, the appliance of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, significantly increased demand
for iron (Historical Note 11.3).
In the nineteenth century, industries such as
railroads, shipbuilding, construction, machinery, and
the military created a dramatic growth in the demand
for iron and steel in Europe and America. Although
large quantities of (crude) pig iron could be produced
by blast furnaces, the subsequent processes for
producing wrought iron and steel were slow. The
necessity to improve productivity of these vital metals

was the ‘‘mother of invention.’’ Henry Bessemer in
England developed the process of blowing air up
through the molten iron that led to the Bessemer
converter (patented in 1856). Pierre and Emile Martin
in France built the first open hearth furnace in 1864.
These methods permitted up to 15 tons of steel to be
produced in a single batch (heat), a substantial
increase from previous methods.
In the United States, expansion of the railroads after
the Civil War created a huge demand for steel. In the
1880s and 1890s, steel beams were first used in
significant quantities in construction. Skyscrapers came
to rely on these steel frames.
When electricity became available in abundance in
the late 1800s, this energy source was used for
steelmaking. The first commercial electric furnace for
production of steel was operated in France in 1899. By
1920, this had become the principal process for making
alloy steels.
The use of pure oxygen in steelmaking was initiated
just before World War II in several European countries
and the United States. Work in Austria after the war
culminated in the development of the basic oxygen
furnace (BOF). This has become the leading modern
technology for producing steel, surpassing the open
hearth method around 1970. The Bessemer converter
had been surpassed by the open hearth method around
1920 and ceased to be a commercial steelmaking
process in 1971.

6.2.1 THE IRON–CARBON PHASE DIAGRAM
The iron–carbon phase diagram is shown in Figure 6.4. Pure iron melts at 1539 C
(2802 F). During the rise in temperature from ambient, it undergoes several solid phase
transformations, as indicated in the diagram. Starting at room temperature the phase is
alpha (a), also called ferrite. At 912 C (1674 F), ferrite transforms to gamma (g), called
austenite. This, in turn, transforms at 1394 C (2541 F) to delta (d), which remains until
melting occurs. The three phases are distinct; alpha and delta have BCC lattice structures
(Section 2.3.1), and between them, gamma is FCC. The video clip on heat treatment
describes the iron–carbon phase diagram and how it is used to strengthen steel.

Iron as a commercial product is available at various levels of purity. Electrolytic iron is the
most pure, at about 99.99%, for research and other purposes where the pure metal is
required. Ingot iron, containing about 0.1% impurities (including about 0.01% carbon), is

used in applications in which high ductility or corrosion resistance are needed. Wrought
iron contains about 3% slag but very little carbon, and is easily shaped in hot forming
operations such as forging.
Solubility limits of carbon in iron are low in the ferrite phase—only about 0.022% at
723 C (1333 F). Austenite can dissolve up to about 2.1% carbon at a temperature of 1130 C
(2066 F). This difference in solubility between alpha and gamma leads to opportunities for
strengthening by heat treatment (but leave that for Chapter 27). Even without heat treatment,
the strength of iron increases dramatically as carbon content increases, and the metal is called
steel. More precisely, steel is defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing from 0.02% to 2.11%
carbon.2 Of course, steels can also contain other alloying elements as well.
A eutectic composition at 4.3% carbon can be seen in the diagram. There is a similar
feature in the solid region of the diagram at 0.77% carbon and 723 C (1333 F). This is called
the eutectoid composition. Steels below this carbon level are known as hypoeutectoid steels,
and above this carbon level, from 0.77% to 2.1%, they are called hypereutectoid steels.
In addition to the phases mentioned, one other phase is prominent in the iron–carbon
alloy system. This is Fe3C, also known as cementite, an intermediate phase. It is a metallic
compound of iron and carbon that is hard and brittle. At room temperature under equilibrium
conditions, iron–carbon alloys form a two-phase system at carbon levels even slightly above
zero. The carbon content in steel ranges between these very low levels and about 2.1% C.
Above 2.1% C, up to about 4% or 5%, the alloy is defined as cast iron.

6.2.2 IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION
Coverage of iron and steel production begins with the iron ores and other raw materials
required. Ironmaking is then discussed, in which iron is reduced from the ores, and
2

This is the conventional definition of steel, but exceptions exist. A recently developed steel for sheetmetal forming, called interstitial-free steel, has a carbon content of only 0.005%. It is discussed in Section
6.2.3.

steelmaking, in which the iron is refined to obtain the desired purity and composition
(alloying). The casting processes that are accomplished at the steel mill are then considered.

Iron Ores and Other Raw Materials The principal ore used in the production of iron
and steel is hematite (Fe2O3). Other iron ores include magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3),
and limonite (Fe2O3-xH2O, in which x is typically around 1.5). Iron ores contain from 50% to
around 70% iron, depending on grade (hematite is almost 70% iron). In addition, scrap iron
and steel are widely used today as raw materials in iron- and steelmaking.
Otherrawmaterialsneededtoreduceironfromtheoresarecokeandlimestone.Cokeisa
high carbon fuel produced by heating bituminous coal in a limited oxygen atmosphere for
several hours, followed by water spraying in special quenching towers. Coke serves two
functions in the reduction process: (1) it is a fuel that supplies heat for the chemical
reactions; and (2) it produces carbon monoxide (CO) to reduce the iron ore. Limestone
is a rock containing high proportions of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The limestone is
used in the process as a flux to react with and remove impurities in the molten iron as slag.
Ironmaking To produce iron, a charge of ore, coke, and limestone are dropped into the
top of a blast furnace. A blast furnace is a refractory-lined chamber with a diameter of
about 9 to 11 m (30–35 ft) at its widest and a height of 40 m (125 ft), in which hot gases are
forced into the lower part of the chamber at high rates to accomplish combustion and
reduction of the iron. A typical blast furnace and some of its technical details are illustrated
in Figures 6.5 and 6.6. The charge slowly descends from the top of the furnace toward the

base and is heated to temperatures around 1650 C (3000 F). Burning of the coke is
accomplished by the hot gases (CO, H2, CO2, H2O, N2, O2, and fuels) as they pass upward
through the layers of charge material. The carbon monoxide is supplied as hot gas, and it is
also formed from combustion of coke. The CO gas has a reducing effect on the iron ore; the
reaction (simplified) can be written as follows (using hematite as the starting ore)

Fe2 O3 þ CO ! 2FeO þ CO2

which then accomplishes the final reduction of FeO to iron

ð6:3cÞ

The molten iron drips downward, collecting at the base of the blast furnace. This is
periodically tapped into hot iron ladle cars for transfer to subsequent steelmaking
operations.
The role played by limestone can be summarized as follows. First the limestone is
reduced to lime (CaO) by heating, as follows
CaCO3 ! CaO þ CO2

ð6:4Þ

The lime combines with impurities such as silica (SiO2), sulfur (S), and alumina (Al2O3)
in reactions that produce a molten slag that floats on top of the iron.
It is instructive to note that approximately 7 tons of raw materials are required to
produce 1 ton of iron. The ingredients are proportioned about as follows: 2.0 tons of
iron ore, 1.0 ton of coke, 0.5 ton of limestone, and (here’s the amazing statistic) 3.5 tons
of gases. A significant proportion of the byproducts are recycled.
The iron tapped from the base of the blast furnace (called pig iron) contains more
than 4% C, plus other impurities: 0.3–1.3% Si, 0.5–2.0% Mn, 0.1–1.0% P, and 0.02–0.08%
S [11]. Further refinement of the metal is required for both cast iron and steel. A furnace
called a cupola (Section 11.4.1) is commonly used for converting pig iron into gray cast
iron. For steel, compositions must be more closely controlled and impurities brought to
much lower levels.

FIGURE 6.7 Basic
oxygen furnace showing
BOF vessel during
processing of a heat.

Steelmaking Since the mid-1800s, a number of processes have been developed for
refining pig iron into steel. Today, the two most important processes are the basic oxygen
furnace (BOF) and the electric furnace. Both are used to produce carbon and alloy steels.
The basic oxygen furnace accounts for about 70% of U.S. steel production. The BOF
is an adaptation of the Bessemer converter. Whereas the Bessemer process used air blown
up through the molten pig iron to burn off impurities, the basic oxygen process uses pure
oxygen. A diagram of the conventional BOF during the middle of a heat is illustrated in
Figure 6.7. The typical BOF vessel is about 5 m (16 ft) inside diameter and can process 150 to
200 tons in a heat.
The BOF steelmaking sequence is shown in Figure 6.8. Integrated steel mills transfer
the molten pig iron from the blast furnace to the BOF in railway cars called hot-iron ladle
cars. In modern practice, steel scrap is added to the pig iron, accounting for about 30% of a
typical BOF charge. Lime (CaO) is also added. After charging, the lance is inserted into the
vessel so that its tip is about 1.5 m (5 ft) above the surface of the molten iron. Pure O2 is
blown at high velocity through the lance, causing combustion and heating at the surface of
the molten pool. Carbon dissolved in the iron and other impurities such as silicon,
manganese, and phosphorus are oxidized. The reactions are

The CO and CO2 gases produced in the first reaction escape through the mouth of the
BOF vessel and are collected by the fume hood; the products of the other three reactions
are removed as slag, using the lime as a fluxing agent. The C content in the iron decreases
almost linearly with time during the process, thus permitting fairly predictable control
over carbon levels in the steel. After refining to the desired level, the molten steel is
tapped; alloying ingredients and other additives are poured into the heat; then the slag is

poured. A 200-ton heat of steel can be processed in about 20 min, although the entire
cycle time (tap-to-tap time) takes about 45 min.
Recent advances in the technology of the basic oxygen process include the use of
nozzles in the bottom of the vessel through which oxygen is injected into the molten iron.
This allows better mixing than the conventional BOF lance, resulting in shorter processing times (a reduction of about 3 min), lower carbon contents, and higher yields.
The electric arc furnace accounts for about 30% of U.S. steel production. Although
pig iron was originally used as the charge in this type of furnace, scrap iron and scrap steel
are the primary raw materials today. Electric arc furnaces are available in several designs;
the direct arc type shown in Figure 6.9 is currently the most economical type. These furnaces
have removable roofs for charging from above; tapping is accomplished by tilting the entire
furnace. Scrap iron and steel selected for their compositions, together with alloying
ingredients and limestone (flux), are charged into the furnace and heated by an electric
arc that flows between large electrodes and the charge metal. Complete melting requires
about 2 hours; tap-to-tap time is 4 hours. Capacities of electric furnaces commonly range
between 25 and 100 tons per heat. Electric arc furnaces are noted for better-quality steel but
higher cost per ton, compared with the BOF. The electric arc furnace is generally associated
with production of alloy steels, tool steels, and stainless steels.

Casting of Ingots Steels produced by BOF or electric furnace are solidified for
subsequent processing either as cast ingots or by continuous casting. Steel ingots are large
discrete castings weighing from less than 1 ton up to around 300 tons (the weight of an entire
heat). Ingot molds are made of high carbon iron and are tapered at the top or bottom for
removal of the solid casting. A big-end-down mold is illustrated in Figure 6.10. The cross

section may be square, rectangular, or round, and the perimeter is usually corrugated to
increase surface area for faster cooling. The mold is placed on a platform called a stool; after
solidification the mold is lifted, leaving the casting on the stool.
The solidification process for ingots as well as other castings is described in the
chapter on casting principles (Chapter 10). Because ingots are such large castings, the
time required for solidification and the associated shrinkage are significant. Porosity
caused by the reaction of carbon and oxygen to form CO during cooling and solidification
is a problem that must be addressed in ingot casting. These gases are liberated from the
molten steel because of their reduced solubility with decreasing temperature. Cast steels
are often treated to limit or prevent CO gas evolution during solidification. The
treatment involves adding elements such as Si and Al that react with the oxygen dissolved
in the molten steel, so it is not available for CO reaction. The structure of the solid steel is
thus free of pores and other defects caused by gas formation.

Continuous Casting Continuous casting is widely applied in aluminum and copper
production, but its most noteworthy application is in steelmaking. The process is replacing
ingot casting because it dramatically increases productivity. Ingot casting is a discrete
process. Because the molds are relatively large, solidification time is significant. For a large

steel ingot, it may take 10 to 12 hours for the casting to solidify. The use of continuous
casting reduces solidification time by an order of magnitude.
The continuous casting process, also called strand casting, is illustrated in Figure 6.11.
Molten steel is poured from a ladle into a temporary container called a tundish, which
dispenses the metal to one or more continuous casting molds. The steel begins to solidify at
the outer regions as it travels down through the water-cooled mold. Water sprays accelerate
the cooling process. While still hot and plastic, the metal is bent from vertical to horizontal
orientation. It is then cut into sections or fed continuously into a rolling mill (Section 19.1)
in which it is formed into plate or sheet stock or other cross sections.

6.2.3 STEELS
As defined earlier, Steel is an alloy of iron that contains carbon ranging by weight between
0.02% and 2.11% (most steels range between 0.05% and 1.1%C). It often includes other
alloying ingredients, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and/or molybdenum (see
Table 6.2); but it is the carbon content that turns iron into steel. Hundreds of compositions
of steel are available commercially. For purposes of organization here, the vast majority of
commercially important steels can be grouped into the following categories: (1) plain carbon

steels, (2) low alloy steels, (3) stainless steels, (4) tool steels, and (5) specialty steels.
Plain Carbon Steels These steels contain carbon as the principal alloying element, with
only small amounts of other elements (about 0.4% manganese plus lesser amounts of

content. A typical plot of the relationship is illustrated in Figure 6.12. As seen in the phase

(a) and cementite (Fe3C). The cementite particles distributed throughout the ferrite act as

obstacles to the movement of dislocations during slip (Section 2.3.3); more carbon leads to
more barriers, and more barriers mean stronger and harder steel.
According to a designation scheme developed by the American Iron and Steel
Institute (AISI) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), plain carbon steels are
specified by a four-digit number system: 10XX, in which 10 indicates that the steel is plain
carbon, and XX indicates the percent of carbon in hundredths of percentage points. For
example, 1020 steel contains 0.20% C. The plain carbon steels are typically classified into
three groups according to their carbon content:

1. Low carbon steels contain less than 0.20% C and are by far the most widely used
steels. Typical applications are automobile sheet-metal parts, plate steel for fabrication, and railroad rails. These steels are relatively easy to form, which accounts for
their popularity where high strength is not required. Steel castings usually fall into
this carbon range, also.
2. Medium carbon steels range in carbon between 0.20% and 0.50% and are specified
for applications requiring higher strength than the low-C steels. Applications
include machinery components and engine parts such as crankshafts and connecting
rods.
3. High carbon steels contain carbon in amounts greater than 0.50%. They are
specified for still higher strength applications and where stiffness and hardness
are needed. Springs, cutting tools and blades, and wear-resistant parts are examples.
Increasing carbon content strengthens and hardens the steel, but its ductility is reduced.
Also, high carbon steels can be heat treated to form martensite, making the steel very
hard and strong (Section 27.2).

Low Alloy Steels Low alloy steels are iron–carbon alloys that contain additional
alloying elements in amounts totaling less than about 5% by weight. Owing to these
additions, low alloy steels have mechanical properties that are superior to those of the
plain carbon steels for given applications. Superior properties usually mean higher
strength, hardness, hot hardness, wear resistance, toughness, and more desirable combinations of these properties. Heat treatment is often required to achieve these improved
properties.
Common alloying elements added to steel are chromium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and vanadium, sometimes individually but usually in combinations. These
elements typically form solid solutions with iron and metallic compounds with carbon
(carbides), assuming sufficient carbon is present to support a reaction. The effects of the
principal alloying ingredients can be summarized as follows:
å Chromium (Cr) improves strength, hardness, wear resistance, and hot hardness.
It is one of the most effective alloying ingredients for increasing hardenability
(Section 27.2.3). In significant proportions, Cr improves corrosion resistance.
å Manganese (Mn) improves the strength and hardness of steel. When the steel is
heat treated, hardenability is improved with increased manganese. Because of
these benefits, manganese is a widely used alloying ingredient in steel.
å Molybdenum (Mo) increases toughness and hot hardness. It also improves
hardenability and forms carbides for wear resistance.
å Nickel (Ni) improves strength and toughness. It increases hardenability but not
as much as some of the other alloying elements in steel. In significant amounts it
improves corrosion resistance and is the other major ingredient (besides chromium) in certain types of stainless steel.

å Vanadium (V) inhibits grain growth during elevated temperature processing
and heat treatment, which enhances strength and toughness of steel. It also
forms carbides that increase wear resistance.
The AISI-SAE designations of many of the low alloy steels are presented in Table 6.2,
which indicates nominal chemical analysis. As before, carbon content is specified by XX in
1=100% of carbon. For completeness, plain carbon steels (10XX) have been included. To
obtain an idea of the properties possessed by some of these steels, Table 6.3 was compiled,
which lists the treatment to which the steel is subjected for strengthening and its strength
and ductility.
Low alloy steels are not easily welded, especially at medium and high carbon levels.
Since the 1960s, research has been directed at developing low carbon, low alloy steels that
have better strength-to-weight ratios than plain carbon steels but are more weldable than low
alloy steels. The products developed out of these efforts are called high-strength low-alloy
(HSLA) steels. They generally have low carbon contents (in the range 0.10%–0.30% C) plus
relatively small amounts of alloying ingredients (usually only about 3% total of elements such
as Mn, Cu, Ni, and Cr). HSLA steels are hot-rolled under controlled conditions designed to
provide improved strength compared with plain C steels, yet with no sacrifice in formability
or weldability. Strengthening is by solid solution alloying; heat treatment is not feasible
because of low carbon content. Table 6.3 lists one HSLA steel, together with properties
(chemistry is: 0.12 C, 0.60 Mn, 1.1 Ni, 1.1 Cr, 0.35 Mo, and 0.4 Si).

Stainless Steels Stainless steels are a group of highly alloyed steels designed to provide
high corrosion resistance. The principal alloying element in stainless steel is chromium,
usually above 15%. The chromium in the alloy forms a thin, impervious oxide film in an

oxidizing atmosphere, which protects the surface from corrosion. Nickel is another alloying
ingredient used in certain stainless steels to increase corrosion protection. Carbon is used to
strengthen and harden the metal; however, increasing the carbon content has the effect of
reducing corrosion protection because chromium carbide forms to reduce the amount of
free Cr available in the alloy.
In addition to corrosion resistance, stainless steels are noted for their combination
of strength and ductility. Although these properties are desirable in many applications,
they generally make these alloys difficult to work in manufacturing. Also, stainless steels
are significantly more expensive than plain C or low alloy steels.
Stainless steels are traditionally divided into three groups, named for the predominant phase present in the alloy at ambient temperature.

1. Austenitic stainless have a typical composition of around 18% Cr and 8% Ni and are
the most corrosion resistant of the three groups. Owing to this composition, they are
sometimesidentifiedas18-8 stainless.Theyarenonmagneticand very ductile; butthey
show significant work hardening. The nickel has the effect of enlarging the austenite
region in the iron–carbon phase diagram, making it stable at room temperature.
Austenitic stainless steels are used to fabricate chemical and food processing equipment, as well as machinery parts requiring high corrosion resistance.
2. Ferritic stainless have around 15% to 20% chromium, low carbon, and no nickel.
This provides a ferrite phase at room temperature. Ferritic stainless steels are
magnetic and are less ductile and corrosion resistant than the austenitics. Parts
made of ferritic stainless range from kitchen utensils to jet engine components.
3. Martensitic stainless have a higher carbon content than ferritic stainlesses, thus
permitting them to be strengthened by heat treatment (Section 27.2). They have
as much as 18% Cr but no Ni. They are strong, hard, and fatigue resistant, but not
generally as corrosion resistant as the other two groups. Typical products include
cutlery and surgical instruments.
Most stainless steels are designated by a three-digit AISI numbering scheme.
The first digit indicates the general type, and the last two digits give the specific grade
within the type. Table 6.4 lists the common stainless steels with typical compositions
and mechanical properties. The traditional stainless steels were developed in the
early 1900s. Since then, several additional high alloy steels have been developed that
have good corrosion resistance and other desirable properties. These are also
classified as stainless steels. Continuing the list:
4. Precipitation hardening stainless, which have a typical composition of 17% Cr
and 7%Ni, with additional small amounts of alloying elements such as aluminum,
copper, titanium, and molybdenum. Their distinguishing feature among stainlesses is that they can be strengthened by precipitation hardening (Section 27.3).
Strength and corrosion resistance are maintained at elevated temperatures, which
suits these alloys to aerospace applications.
5. Duplex stainless possess a structure that is a mixture of austenite and ferrite in
roughly equal amounts. Their corrosion resistance is similar to the austenitic grades,
and they show improved resistance to stress-corrosion cracking. Applications
include heat exchangers, pumps, and wastewater treatment plants.
Tool Steels Tool steels are a class of (usually) highly alloyed steels designed for use as
industrial cutting tools, dies, and molds. To perform in these applications, they must possess
high strength, hardness, hot hardness, wear resistance, and toughness under impact. To
obtain these properties, tool steels are heat treated. Principal reasons for the high levels of
alloying elements are (1) improved hardenability, (2) reduced distortion during heat

High-speed tool steels are used as cutting tools in machining processes (Section
23.2.1). They are formulated for high wear resistance and hot hardness. The
original high-speed steels (HSS) were developed around 1900. They permitted
dramatic increases in cutting speed compared to previously used tools; hence
their name. The two AISI designations indicate the principal alloying element:
T for tungsten and M for molybdenum.
Hot-working tool steels are intended for hot-working dies in forging,
extrusion, and die-casting.
Cold-work tool steels are die steels used for cold working operations such as
sheetmetal pressworking, cold extrusion, and certain forging operations. The
designation D stands for die. Closely related AISI designations are A and O. A
and O stand for air- and oil-hardening. They all provide good wear resistance and
low distortion.
Water-hardening tool steels have high carbon with little or no other alloying
elements. They can only be hardened by fast quenching in water. They are
widely used because of low cost, but they are limited to low temperature
applications. Cold heading dies are a typical application.
Shock-resistant tool steels are intended for use in applications where high
toughness is required, as in many sheetmetal shearing, punching, and bending
operations.
Mold steels are used to make molds for molding plastics and rubber.
Low-alloy tool steels are generally reserved for special applications.

Tool steels are not the only tool materials. Plain carbon, low alloy, and stainless steels
are used for many tool and die applications. Cast irons and certain nonferrous alloys are
also suitable for certain tooling applications. In addition, several ceramic materials (e.g.,
Al2O3) are used as high-speed cutting inserts, abrasives, and other tools.

Specialty Steels To complete this survey, several specialty steels are mentioned that
are not included in the previous coverage. One of the reasons why these steels are special
is that they possess unique processing characteristics.
Maraging steels are low carbon alloys containing high amounts of nickel (15% to
25%) and lesser proportions of cobalt, molybdenum, and titanium. Chromium is also
sometimes added for corrosion resistance. Maraging steels are strengthened by precipitation hardening (Section 27.3), but in the unhardened condition, they are quite processable
by forming and/or machining. They can also be readily welded. Heat treatment results in
very high strength together with good toughness. Tensile strengths of 2000 MPa (290,000 lb/
in2) and 10% elongation are not unusual. Applications include parts for missiles, machinery, dies, and other situations where these properties are required and justify the high cost of
the alloy.
Free-machining steels are carbon steels formulated to improve machinability (Section
24.1). Alloying elements include sulfur, lead, tin, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, and/or
phosphorus. Lead is less-frequently used today because of environmental and health concerns.
Added in small amounts, these elements act to lubricate the cutting operation, reduce friction,
and break up chips for easier disposal. Although more expensive than non-free-machining
steels, they often pay for themselves in higher production rates and longer tool lives.
Because of their good ductility, low-carbon sheet steels are widely used in sheet-metal
forming operations. Further improvements in formability have been achieved using a new
class of sheet steel product called interstitial-free steels. These steels have extremely low
carbon levels (0.005% C), which result from the use of alloying elements such as niobium and
titanium that combine with C and leave the steel virtually free of interstitial atoms. The result

is excellent ductility, even greater than low-C steels. Applications include deep-drawing
operations in the automotive industry.

6.2.4 CAST IRONS
Cast iron is an iron alloy containing from 2.1% to about 4% carbon and from 1% to 3%
silicon. Its composition makes it highly suitable as a casting metal. In fact, the tonnage of
cast iron castings is several times that of all other cast metal parts combined (excluding
cast ingots made during steelmaking, which are subsequently rolled into bars, plates, and
similar stock). The overall tonnage of cast iron is second only to steel among metals.
There are several types of cast iron, the most important being gray cast iron. Other
types include ductile iron, white cast iron, malleable iron, and various alloy cast irons.
Typical chemical compositions of gray and white cast irons are shown in Figure 6.13,
indicating their relationship with cast steel. Ductile and malleable irons possess chemistries similar to the gray and white cast irons, respectively, but result from special
treatments to be described in the following. Table 6.6 presents a listing of chemistries
for the principal types together with mechanical properties.

Gray Cast Iron Graycast iron accounts for the largest tonnageamongthe castirons.It has a
compositionintherange2.5% to 4%carbonand 1% to3%silicon.Thischemistryresults in the
formation of graphite (carbon) flakes distributed throughout the cast product upon solidification. The structure causes the surface of the metal to have a gray color when fractured; hence
the name gray cast iron. The dispersion of graphite flakes accounts for two attractive
properties: (1) good vibration damping, which is desirable in engines and other machinery; and (2) internal lubricating qualities, which makes the cast metal machinable.
The strength of gray cast iron spans a significant range. The American Society for
Testing of Materials (ASTM) uses a classification method for gray cast iron that is intended
to provide a minimum tensile strength (TS) specification for the various classes: Class 20
gray cast iron has a TS of 20,000 lb=in2, Class 30 has a TS of 30,000 lb/in2, and so forth, up to
around 70,000 lb=in2 (see Table 6.6 for equivalent TS in metric units). The compressive
strength of gray cast iron is significantly greater than its tensile strength. Properties of the
casting can be controlled to some extent by heat treatment. Ductility of gray cast iron is very
low; it is a relatively brittle material. Products made from gray cast iron include automotive
engine blocks and heads, motor housings, and machine tool bases.

most common identification for each type.
a
Cast irons also contain phosphorus and sulfur usually totaling less than 0.3%.

Ductile Iron This is an iron with the composition of gray iron in which the molten
metal is chemically treated before pouring to cause the formation of graphite spheroids
rather than flakes. This results in a stronger and more ductile iron, hence its name.
Applications include machinery components requiring high strength and good wear
resistance.
White Cast Iron This cast iron has less carbon and silicon than gray cast iron. It is
formed by more rapid cooling of the molten metal after pouring, thus causing the carbon
to remain chemically combined with iron in the form of cementite (Fe3C), rather than
precipitating out of solution in the form of flakes. When fractured, the surface has a
white crystalline appearance that gives the iron its name. Owing to the cementite, white
cast iron is hard and brittle, and its wear resistance is excellent. Strength is good, with TS
of 276 MPa (40,000 lb/in2) being typical. These properties make white cast iron suitable
for applications in which wear resistance is required. Railway brake shoes are an
example.
Malleable Iron When castings of white cast iron are heat treated to separate the carbon
out of solution and form graphite aggregates, the resulting metal is called malleable iron.
The new microstructure can possess substantial ductility (up to 20% elongation)—a
significant difference from the metal out of which it was transformed. Typical products
made of malleable cast iron include pipe fittings and flanges, certain machine components,
and railroad equipment parts.
Alloy Cast Irons Cast irons can be alloyed for special properties and applications.
These alloy cast irons are classified as follows: (1) heat-treatable types that can be
hardened by martensite formation; (2) corrosion-resistant types, whose alloying
elements include nickel and chromium; and (3) heat-resistant types containing
high proportions of nickel for hot hardness and resistance to high temperature
oxidation.

NONFERROUS METALS
The nonferrous metals include metal elements and alloys not based on iron. The most
important engineering metals in the nonferrous group are aluminum, copper, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and zinc, and their alloys.
Although the nonferrous metals as a group cannot match the strength of the steels,
certain nonferrous alloys have corrosion resistance and/or strength-to-weight ratios that
make them competitive with steels in moderate-to-high stress applications. In addition,
many of the nonferrous metals have properties other than mechanical that make them
ideal for applications in which steel would be quite unsuitable. For example, copper has
one of the lowest electrical resistivities among metals and is widely used for electrical
wire. Aluminum is an excellent thermal conductor, and its applications include heat
exchangers and cooking pans. It is also one of the most readily formed metals, and is
valued for that reason also. Zinc has a relatively low melting point, so zinc is widely used
in die casting operations. The common nonferrous metals have their own combination of
properties that make them attractive in a variety of applications. The following nine
sections discuss the nonferrous metals that are the most commercially and technologically important.

6.3.1 ALUMINUM AND ITS ALLOYS
Aluminum and magnesium are light metals, and they are often specified in engineering
applications for this feature. Both elements are abundant on Earth, aluminum on land
and magnesium in the sea, although neither is easily extracted from their natural states.
Properties and other data on aluminum are listed in Table 6.1(b). Among the major
metals, it is a relative newcomer, dating only to the late 1800s (Historical Note 6.2). The
coverage in this section includes (1) a brief description of how aluminum is produced

and (2) a discussion of the properties and the designation system for the metal and its
alloys.
Aluminum Production The principal aluminum ore is bauxite, which consists largely
of hydrated aluminum oxide (Al2O3-H2O) and other oxides. Extraction of the aluminum
from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and crushing the ore into fine
powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is converted to pure alumina
(Al2O3); and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is separated into aluminum and

n 1807, the English chemist Humphrey Davy, believing
that the mineral alumina (Al2O3) had a metallic base,
attempted to extract the metal. He did not succeed, but
was sufficiently convinced that he proceeded to name
the metal anyway: alumium, later changing the name to
aluminum. In 1825, the Danish physicist/chemist Hans
Orsted finally succeeded in separating the metal. He
noted that it ‘‘resembles tin.’’ In 1845, the German
physicist Friedrich Wohler was the first to determine the
specific gravity, ductility, and various other properties of
aluminum.
The modern electrolytic process for producing
aluminum was based on the concurrent but

independent work of Charles Hall in the United States
and Paul Heroult in France around 1886. In 1888,
Hall and a group of businessmen started the Pittsburgh
Reduction Co. The first ingot of aluminum was
produced by the electrolytic smelting process that
same year. Demand for aluminum grew. The need for
large amounts of electricity in the production process
led the company to relocate in Niagara Falls in 1895,
where hydroelectric power was becoming available at
very low cost. In 1907, the company changed its
name to the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa).
It was the sole producer of aluminum in the United
States until World War II.

oxygen gas (O2). The Bayer process, named after the German chemist who developed
it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aqueous caustic soda (NaOH) under
pressure, followed by precipitation of pure Al2O3 from solution. Alumina is commercially important in its own right as an engineering ceramic (Chapter 7).
Electrolysis to separate Al2O3 into its constituent elements requires dissolving the
precipitate in a molten bath of cryolite (Na3AlF6) and subjecting the solution to direct
current between the plates of an electrolytic furnace. The electrolyte dissociates to form
aluminum at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode.
Properties and Designation Scheme Aluminum has high electrical and thermal
conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion is excellent because of the formation of a
hard, thin oxide surface film. It is a very ductile metal and is noted for its formability.
Pure aluminum is relatively low in strength, but it can be alloyed and heat treated to
compete with some steels, especially when weight is an important consideration.
The designation system for aluminum alloys is a four-digit code number. The system
has two parts, one for wrought aluminums and the other for cast aluminums. The difference
is that a decimal point is used after the third digit for cast aluminums. The designations are
presented in Table 6.7(a).

TABLE 6.7(b)

Temper designations for aluminum alloys.

Temper

Description

F

As fabricated—no special treatment.

H

Strain hardened (wrought aluminums). H is followed by two digits, the first indicating a heat treatment,
if any; and the second indicating the degree of work hardening remaining; for example:
H1X No heat treatment after strain hardening, and X ¼ 1 to 9, indicating degree of work hardening.
H2X Partially annealed, and X ¼ degree of work hardening remaining in product.
H3X Stabilized, and X ¼ degree of work hardening remaining. Stabilized means heating to slightly
above service temperature anticipated.

O

Annealed to relieve strain hardening and improve ductility; reduces strength to lowest level.

T

Thermal treatment to produce stable tempers other than F, H, or O. It is followed by a digit to indicate
specific treatments; for example:
T1 ¼ cooled from elevated temperature, naturally aged.
T2 ¼ cooled from elevated temperature, cold worked, naturally aged.
T3 ¼ solution heat treated, cold worked, naturally aged.
T4 ¼ solution heat treated and naturally aged.
T5 ¼ cooled from elevated temperature, artificially aged.
T6 ¼ solution heat treated and artificially aged.
T7 ¼ solution heat treated and overaged or stabilized.
T8 ¼ solution heat treated, cold worked, artificially aged.
T9 ¼ solution heat treated, artificially aged, and cold worked.
T10 ¼ cooled from elevated temperature, cold worked, and artificially aged.

W

Solution heat treatment, applied to alloys that age harden in service; it is an unstable temper.

Because properties of aluminum alloys are so influenced by work hardening and heat
treatment, the temper (strengthening treatment, if any) must be designated in addition to the
composition code. The principal temper designations are presented in Table 6.7(b). This
designation is attached to the preceding four-digit number, separated from it by a hyphen, to
indicate the treatment or absence thereof; for example, 2024-T3. Of course, temper treatments that specify strain hardening do not apply to the cast alloys. Some examples of the
remarkable differences in the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys that result from the
different treatments are presented in Table 6.8.

6.3.2 MAGNESIUM AND ITS ALLOYS
Magnesium (Mg) is the lightest of the structural metals. Its specific gravity and other basic
data are presented in Table 6.1(c). Magnesium and its alloys are available in both wrought and
cast forms. It is relatively easy to machine. However, in all processing of magnesium, small

particles of the metal (such as small metal cutting chips) oxidize rapidly, and care must be
taken to avoid fire hazards.

Magnesium Production Sea water contains about 0.13% MgCl2, and this is the source
of most commercially produced magnesium. To extract Mg, a batch of sea water is mixed
with milk of lime–calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). The resulting reaction precipitates
magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) that settles and is removed as a slurry. The slurry is
then filtered to increase Mg(OH)2 content and then mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl),
which reacts with the hydroxide to form concentrated MgCl2—much more concentrated
than the original sea water. Electrolysis is used to decompose the salt into magnesium (Mg)
and chlorine gas (Cl2). The magnesium is then cast into ingots for subsequent processing.
The chlorine is recycled to form more MgCl2.
Properties and Designation Scheme As a pure metal, magnesium is relatively soft
and lacks sufficient strength for most engineering applications. However, it can be alloyed
and heat treated to achieve strengths comparable to aluminum alloys. In particular, its
strength-to-weight ratio is an advantage in aircraft and missile components.
The designation scheme for magnesium alloys uses a three-to-five character alphanumeric code. The first two characters are letters that identify the principal alloying elements
(up to two elements can be specified in the code, in order of decreasing percentages, or
alphabetically if equal percentages). These code letters are listed in Table 6.9. The letters are
followed by a two-digit number that indicates, respectively, the amounts of the two alloying
ingredients to the nearest percent. Finally, the last symbol is a letter that indicates some
variation in composition, or simply the chronological order in which it was standardized for
commercial availability. Magnesium alloys also require specification of a temper, and the
same basic scheme presented in Table 6.7(b) for aluminum is used for magnesium alloys.
Some examples of magnesium alloys, illustrating the designation scheme and
indicating tensile strength and ductility of these alloys, are presented in Table 6.10.

6.3.3 COPPER AND ITS ALLOYS
Copper (Cu) is one of the oldest metals known (Historical Note 6.3). Basic data on the
element copper are presented in Table 6.1(d).

Copper Production In ancient times, copper was available in nature as a free element.
Today these natural deposits are more difficult to find, and copper is now extracted from ores
that are mostly sulfides, such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). The ore is crushed (Section 17.1.1),
concentrated by flotation, and then smelted (melted or fused, often with an associated
chemical reaction to separate a metal from its ore). The resulting copper is called blister
copper, which is between 98% and 99% pure. Electrolysis is used to obtain higher purity
levels suitable for commercial use.
Properties and Designation Scheme Pure copper has a distinctive reddish-pink color,

Copper

opper was one of the first metals used by human
cultures (gold was the other). Discovery of the metal was
probably around 6000 BCE. At that time, copper was
found in the free metallic state. Ancient peoples
fashioned implements and weapons out of it by hitting
the metal (cold forging). Pounding copper made it harder
(strain hardening); this and its attractive reddish color
made it valuable in early civilizations.
Around 4000 BCE, it was discovered that copper could
be melted and cast into useful shapes. It was later found

that copper mixed with tin could be more readily cast
and worked than the pure metal. This led to the
widespread use of bronze and the subsequent naming of
the Bronze Age, dated from about 2000 BCE to the time of
Christ.
To the ancient Romans, the island of Cyprus was
almost the only source of copper. They called the metal
aes cyprium (ore of Cyprus). This was shortened to
Cyprium and subsequently renamed Cuprium. From this
derives the chemical symbol Cu.

significantly as alloying elements are added.) Cu is also an excellent thermal conductor. Copper
isoneofthenoblemetals(goldandsilverarealsonoblemetals),soitiscorrosionresistant.Allof
these properties combine to make copper one of the most important metals.
On the downside, the strength and hardness of copper are relatively low, especially
when weight is taken into account. Accordingly, to improve strength (as well as for other
reasons), copper is frequently alloyed. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin (typically about
90% Cu and 10% Sn), still widely used today despite its ancient ancestry. Additional bronze
alloys have been developed, based on other elements than tin; these include aluminum
bronzes, and silicon bronzes. Brass is another familiar copper alloy, composed of copper and
zinc (typically around 65% Cu and 35% Zn). The highest strength alloy of copper is
beryllium-copper (only about 2% Be). It can be heat treated to tensile strengths of 1035
MPa (150,000 lb/in2). Be-Cu alloys are used for springs.
The designation of copper alloys is based on the Unified Numbering System for
Metals and Alloys (UNS), which uses a five-digit number preceded by the letter C (C for
copper). The alloys are processed in wrought and cast forms, and the designation system
includes both. Some copper alloys with compositions and mechanical properties are
presented in Table 6.11.

6.3.4 NICKEL AND ITS ALLOYS
Nickel (Ni) is similar to iron in many respects. It is magnetic, and its modulus of elasticity
is virtually the same as that of iron and steel. However, it is much more corrosion
resistant, and the high temperature properties of its alloys are generally superior.
Because of its corrosion-resistant characteristics, it is widely used as an alloying element
in steel, such as stainless steel, and as a plating metal on other metals such as plain carbon
steel.

Nickel Production The most important ore of nickel is pentlandite ((Ni, Fe)9S8). To
extract the nickel, the ore is first crushed and ground with water. Flotation techniques are used
to separate the sulfides from other minerals mixed with the ore. The nickel sulfide is then
heated to burn off some of the sulfur, followed by smelting to remove iron and silicon. Further
refinement is accomplished in a Bessemer-style converter to yield high-concentration nickel
sulfide (NiS). Electrolysis is then used to recover high-purity nickel from the compound. Ores
of nickel are sometimes mixed with copper ores, and the recovery technique described here
also yields copper in these cases.
Nickel Alloys Alloys of nickel are commercially important in their own right and are
noted for corrosion resistance and high temperature performance. Composition, tensile
strength, and ductility of some of the nickel alloys are given in Table 6.12. In addition, a
number of superalloys are based on nickel (Section 6.4).

6.3.5 TITANIUM AND ITS ALLOYS
Titanium (Ti) is fairly abundant in nature, constituting about 1% of Earth’s crust (aluminum,
the most abundant, is about 8%). The density of Ti is between aluminum and iron; these and
other data are presented in Table 6.1(f). Its importance has grown in recent decades due to

its aerospace applications, in which its light weight and good strength-to-weight ratio are
exploited.

Titanium Production The principal ores of titanium are rutile, which is 98% to 99%
TiO2, and ilmenite, which is a combination of FeO and TiO2. Rutile is preferred as an ore
because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the TiO2 is converted
to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) by reacting the compound with chlorine gas. This is
followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities. The highly concentrated
TiCl4 is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with magnesium; this is known as the
Kroll process. Sodium can also be used as a reducing agent. In either case, an inert
atmosphere must be maintained to prevent O2, N2, or H2 from contaminating the Ti,
owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The resulting metal is used to cast ingots of
titanium and its alloys.
Properties of Titanium Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low among
metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength at elevated
temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in processing, especially
in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms a thin adherent oxide coating
(TiO2) that provides excellent corrosion resistance.
These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in the
commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as marine
components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as high-strength
components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above 550 C (1000 F),
especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These latter
applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying elements
used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium. Some compositions and mechanical properties for several alloys are presented in Table 6.13.

Zinc creeps, which makes it difficult to measure modulus of elasticity; some tables of properties omit E for zinc for this reason.

6.3.6 ZINC AND ITS ALLOYS
Table 6.1(g) lists basic data on zinc. Its low melting point makes it attractive as a casting
metal. It also provides corrosion protection when coated onto steel or iron; galvanized
steel is steel that has been coated with zinc.

Production of Zinc Zinc blende or sphalerite is the principal ore of zinc; it contains
zinc sulfide (ZnS). Other important ores include smithsonite, which is zinc carbonate
(ZnCO3), and hemimorphate, which is hydrous zinc silicate (Zn4Si2O7OH-H2O).
Sphalerite must be concentrated (beneficiated, as it is called) because of the small
fraction of zinc sulfide present in the ore. This is accomplished by first crushing the ore, then
grinding with water in a ball mill (Section 17.1.1) to create a slurry. In the presence of a
frothing agent, the slurry is agitated so that the mineral particles float to the top and can be
skimmed off (separated from the lower-grade minerals). The concentrated zinc sulfide is then
roasted at around 1260 C (2300 F), so that zinc oxide (ZnO) is formed from the reaction.
There are various thermochemical processes for recovering zinc from this oxide, all of
which reduce zinc oxide by means of carbon. The carbon combines with oxygen in ZnO to
form CO and/or CO2, thus freeing Zn in the form of vapor that is condensed to yield the
desired metal.
An electrolytic process is also widely used, accounting for about half the world’s
production of zinc. This process also begins with the preparation of ZnO, which is mixed
with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4), followed by electrolysis to separate the resulting zinc
sulfate (ZnSO4) solution to yield the pure metal.
Zinc Alloys and Applications Several alloys of zinc are listed in Table 6.14, with data
on composition, tensile strength, and applications. Zinc alloys are widely used in die casting
to mass produce components for the automotive and appliance industries. Another major
application of zinc is in galvanized steel. As the name suggests, a galvanic cell is created in

galvanized steel (Zn is the anode and steel is the cathode) that protects the steel from
corrosive attack. A third important use of zinc is in brass. As previously indicated in the
discussion of copper, this alloy consists of copper and zinc, in the ratio of about 2/3 Cu to 1/3
Zn. Finally, readers may be interested to know that the U.S. one cent coin is mostly zinc. The
penny is coined out of zinc and then electroplated with copper, so that the final proportions
are 97.5% Zn and 2.5% Cu. It costs the U.S. Mint about 1.5 cents to produce each penny.

6.3.7 LEAD AND TIN
Lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) are often considered together because of their low melting
temperatures, and because they are used in soldering alloys to make electrical connections.
The phase diagram for the tin–lead alloy system is depicted in Figure 6.3. Basic data for lead
and tin are presented in Table 6.1(h).
Lead is a dense metal with a low melting point; other properties include low strength,
low hardness (the word ‘‘soft’’ is appropriate), high ductility, and good corrosion resistance.
In addition to its use in solder, applications of lead and its alloys include ammunition, type
metals, x-ray shielding, storage batteries, bearings, and vibration damping. It has also been
widely used in chemicals and paints. Principal alloying elements with lead are tin and
antimony.
Tin has an even lower melting point than lead; other properties include low strength,
low hardness, and good ductility. The earliest use of tin was in bronze, the alloy consisting of
copper and tin developed around 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Bronze is still an
important commercial alloy (although its relative importance has declined during 5000
years). Other uses of tin include tin-coated sheet steel containers (‘‘tin cans’’) for storing
food and, of course, solder metal.

6.3.8 REFRACTORY METALS
The refractory metals are metals capable of enduring high temperatures. The most
important metals in this group are molybdenum and tungsten; see Table 6.1(i). Other
refractory metals are columbium (Cb) and tantalum (Ta). In general, these metals and their
alloys are capable of maintaining high strength and hardness at elevated temperatures.
Molybdenum has a high melting point and is relatively dense, stiff, and strong. It is
used both as a pure metal (99.9+% Mo) and as an alloy. The principal alloy is TZM, which
contains small amounts of titanium and zirconium (less than 1% total). Mo and its alloys
possess good high temperature strength, and this accounts for many of its applications,
which include heat shields, heating elements, electrodes for resistance welding, dies for high

temperature work (e.g., die casting molds), and parts for rocket and jet engines. In addition
to these applications, molybdenum is also widely used as an alloying ingredient in other
metals, such as steels and superalloys.
Tungsten (W) has the highest melting point among metals and is one of the densest.
It is also the stiffest and hardest of all pure metals. Its most familiar application is filament
wire in incandescent light bulbs. Applications of tungsten are typically characterized by
high operating temperatures, such as parts for rocket and jet engines and electrodes for
arc welding. W is also widely used as an element in tool steels, heat resistant alloys, and
tungsten carbide (Section 7.3.2).
A major disadvantage of both Mo and W is their propensity to oxidize at high
temperatures, above about 600 C (1000 F), thus detracting from their high temperature
properties. To overcome this deficiency, either protective coatings must be used on these
metals in high temperature applications or the metal parts must operate in a vacuum. For
example, the tungsten filament must be energized in a vacuum inside the glass light bulb.

6.3.9 PRECIOUS METALS
The precious metals, also called the noble metals because they are chemically inactive,
include silver, gold, and platinum. They are attractive metals, available in limited supply,
and have been used throughout civilized history for coinage and to underwrite paper

All three precious metals are mined from deposits in which the pure metal is mixed with other ores and
metals. Silver is also mined from the ore Argentite (Ag2S).

currency. They are also widely used in jewelry and similar applications that exploit their
high value. As a group, these precious metals possess high density, good ductility, high
electrical conductivity, and good corrosion resistance; see Table 6.1(j).
Silver (Ag) is less expensive per unit weight than gold or platinum. Nevertheless, its
attractive ‘‘silvery’’ luster makes it a highly valued metal in coins, jewelry, and tableware
(which even assumes the name of the metal: ‘‘silverware’’). It is also used for fillings in
dental work. Silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any metal, which makes it
useful for contacts in electronics applications. Finally, it should be mentioned that lightsensitive silver chloride and other silver halides are the basis for photography.
Gold (Au) is one of the heaviest metals; it is soft and easily formed, and possesses a
distinctive yellow color that adds to its value. In addition to currency and jewelry, its
applications include electrical contacts (owing to its good electrical conductivity and
corrosion resistance), dental work, and plating onto other metals for decorative purposes.
Platinum (Pt) is also used in jewelry and is in fact more expensive than gold. It is the
most important of six precious metals known as the platinum group metals, which consists
of Ruthenium (Ru), Rhodium (Rh), Palladium (Pd), Osmium (Os), and Iridium (Ir), in
addition to Pt. They are clustered in a rectangle in the periodic table (Figure 2.1). Osmium,
Iridium, and Platinum are all denser than gold (Ir is the densest material known, at 22.65 g/
cm3). Because the platinum group metals are all scarce and very expensive, their applications are generally limited to situations in which only small amounts are needed and their
unique properties are required (e.g., high melting temperatures, corrosion resistance,
and catalytic characteristics). The applications include thermocouples, electrical contacts,
spark plugs, corrosion resistant devices, and catalytic pollution control equipment for
automobiles.

6.4

SUPERALLOYS
Superalloys constitute a category that straddles the ferrous and nonferrous metals. Some
of them are based on iron, whereas others are based on nickel and cobalt. In fact, many of
the superalloys contain substantial amounts of three or more metals, rather than
consisting of one base metal plus alloying elements. Although the tonnage of these
metals is not significant compared with most of the other metals discussed in this chapter,
they are nevertheless commercially important because they are very expensive; and they
are technologically important because of what they can do.
The superalloys are a group of high-performance alloys designed to meet very
demanding requirements for strength and resistance to surface degradation (corrosion and
oxidation) at high service temperatures. Conventional room temperature strength is
usually not the important criterion for these metals, and most of them possess room
temperature strength properties that are good but not outstanding. Their high temperature
performance is what distinguishes them; tensile strength, hot hardness, creep resistance,
and corrosion resistance at very elevated temperatures are the mechanical properties of
interest. Operating temperatures are often in the vicinity of 1100 C (2000 F). These metals
are widely used in gas turbines—jet and rocket engines, steam turbines, and nuclear power
plants—systems in which operating efficiency increases with higher temperatures.
The superalloys are usually divided into three groups, according to their principal
constituent: iron, nickel, or cobalt:

å Iron-based alloys have iron as the main ingredient, although in some cases the
iron is less than 50% of the total composition.
å Nickel-based alloys generally have better high temperature strength than alloy
steels. Nickel is the base metal. The principal alloying elements are chromium and

cobalt; lesser elements include aluminum, titanium, molybdenum, niobium (Nb),
and iron. Some familiar names in this group include Inconel, Hastelloy, and Rene 41.
å Cobalt-based alloys consist of cobalt (around 40%) and chromium (perhaps
20%) as their main components. Other alloying elements include nickel,
molybdenum, and tungsten.
In virtually all of the superalloys, including those based on iron, strengthening is
accomplished by precipitation hardening. The iron-based superalloys do not use martensite
formation for strengthening. Typical compositions and strength properties at room temperature and elevated temperature for some of the alloys are presented in Table 6.15.

6.5

GUIDE TO THE PROCESSING OF METALS
A wide variety of manufacturing processes are available to shape metals, enhance their
properties, assemble them, and finish them for appearance and protection.

Shaping, Assembly, and Finishing Processes Metals are shaped by all of the basic
processes, including casting, powder metallurgy, deformation processes, and material
removal. In addition, metal parts are joined to form assemblies by welding, brazing,
soldering, and mechanical fastening; and finishing processes are commonly used to improve
the appearance of metal parts and/or to provide corrosion protection. These finishing
operations include electroplating and painting.
Enhancement of Mechanical Properties in Metals Mechanical properties of
metals can be altered by a number of techniques. Some of these techniques have

E1C06

14:12:35

Page 133

Review Questions

133

been referred to in the discussion of the various metals. Methods for enhancing
mechanical properties of metals can be grouped into three categories: (1) alloying,

(2) cold working, and (3) heat treatment. Alloying has been discussed throughout
the present chapter and is an important technique for strengthening metals. Cold
working has previously been referred to as strain hardening; its effect is to increase
strength and reduce ductility. The degree to which these mechanical properties are
affected depends on the amount of strain and the strain hardening exponent in the
flow curve, Eq. (3.10). Cold working can be used on both pure metals and alloys. It is
accomplished during deformation of the workpart by one of the shape forming
processes, such as rolling, forging, or extrusion. Strengthening of the metal therefore
occurs as a by-product of the shaping operation.
Heat treatment refers to several types of heating and cooling cycles performed on a
metal to beneficially change its properties. They operate by altering the basic microstructure of the metal, which in turn determines mechanical properties. Some heat
treatment operations are applicable only to certain types of metals; for example, the heat
treatment of steel to form martensite is somewhat specialized because martensite is
unique to steel. Heat treatments for steels and other metals are discussed in Chapter 27.

We usually consider metals to be the most important class of
engineering materials. However, it is of interest to note that
ceramic materials are actually more abundant and widely
used. Included in this category are clay products (e.g., bricks
and pottery), glass, cement, and more modern ceramic
materials such as tungsten carbide and cubic boron nitride.
This is the class of materials discussed in this chapter. We also
include coverage of several elements related to ceramics
because they are sometimes used in similar applications.
These elements are carbon, silicon, and boron.
The importance of ceramics as engineering materials
derives from their abundance in nature and their mechanical
and physical properties, which are quite different from those of
metals. A ceramic material is an inorganic compound consisting of a metal (or semimetal) and one or more nonmetals. The
word ceramic traces from the Greek keramos meaning potter’s clay or wares made from fired clay. Important examples of
ceramic materials are silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), the main
ingredient in most glass products; alumina, or aluminum oxide
(Al2O3), used in applications ranging from abrasives to artificial bones; and more complex compounds such as hydrous
aluminum silicate (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), known as kaolinite, the
principal ingredient in most clay products. The elements in
these compounds are the most common in Earth’s crust; see
Table 7.1. The group includes many additional compounds,
some of which occur naturally while others are manufactured.
The general properties that make ceramics useful in
engineered products are high hardness, good electrical and
thermal insulating characteristics, chemical stability, and high
melting temperatures. Some ceramics are translucent—window glass being the clearest example. They are also brittle and
possess virtually no ductility, which can cause problems in
both processing and performance of ceramic products.
The commercial and technological importance of
ceramics is best demonstrated by the variety of products
and applications that are based on this class of material. The
list includes:

å Bioceramics, which include materials used in artificial teeth and bones
For purposes of organization, we classify ceramic materials into three basic types:
(1) traditional ceramics—silicates used for clay products such as pottery and bricks,
common abrasives, and cement; (2) new ceramics—more recently developed ceramics
based on nonsilicates such as oxides and carbides, and generally possessing mechanical or
physical properties that are superior or unique compared to traditional ceramics; and
(3) glasses—based primarily on silica and distinguished from the other ceramics by their
noncrystalline structure. In addition to the three basic types, we have glass ceramics—
glasses that have been transformed into a largely crystalline structure by heat treatment.

7.1

STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF CERAMICS
Ceramic compounds are characterized by covalent and ionic bonding. These bonds are
stronger than metallic bonding in metals, which accounts for the high hardness and stiffness
but low ductility of ceramic materials. Just as the presence of free electrons in the metallic
bond explains why metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, the presence of
tightly held electrons in ceramic molecules explains why these materials are poor conductors. The strong bonding also provides these materials with high melting temperatures,
although some ceramics decompose, rather than melt, at elevated temperatures.
Most ceramics take a crystalline structure. The structures are generally more complex
than those of most metals. There are several reasons for this. First, ceramic molecules usually
consist of atoms that are significantly different in size. Second, the ion charges are often
different, as in many of the common ceramics such as SiO2 and Al2O3. Both of these factors
tend to force a more complicated physical arrangement of the atoms in the molecule and in
the resulting crystal structure. In addition, many ceramic materials consist of more than two

E1C07

Chapter 7/Ceramics

elements, such as (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), also leading to further complexity in the molecular
structure. Crystalline ceramics can be single crystals or polycrystalline substances. In the
more common second form, mechanical and physical properties are affected by grain size;
higher strength and toughness are achieved in the finer-grained materials.
Some ceramic materials tend to assume an amorphous structure or glassy phase,
rather than a crystalline form. The most familiar example is, of course, glass. Chemically,
most glasses consist of fused silica. Variations in properties and colors are obtained by adding
other glassy ceramic materials such as oxides of aluminum, boron, calcium, and magnesium.
In addition to these pure glasses, many ceramics that have a crystal structure use the glassy
phase as a binder for their crystalline phase.

7.1.1 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
Basic mechanical properties of ceramics are presented in Chapter 3. Ceramic materials are
rigid and brittle, exhibiting a stress-strain behavior best characterized as perfectly elastic
(see Figure 3.6). As seen in Table 7.2, hardness and elastic modulus for many of the new
ceramics are greater than those of metals (see Tables 3.1, 3.6, and 3.7). Stiffness and
hardness of traditional ceramics and glasses are significantly less than for new ceramics.
Theoretically, the strength of ceramics should be higher than that of metals because of
their atomic bonding. The covalent and ionic bonding types are stronger than metallic
bonding. However, metallic bonding has the advantage that it allows for slip, the basic
mechanism by which metals deform plastically when subjected to high stresses. Bonding in
ceramics is more rigid and does not permit slip under stress. The inability to slip makes it
much more difficult for ceramics to absorb stresses. Yet ceramics contain the same
imperfections in their crystal structure as metals—vacancies, interstitialcies, displaced
atoms, and microscopic cracks. These internal flaws tend to concentrate the stresses,
especially when a tensile, bending, or impact loading is involved. As a result of these factors,
ceramics fail by brittle fracture under applied stress much more readily than metals. Their

tensile strength and toughness are relatively low. Also, their performance is much less
predictable due to the random nature of the imperfections and the influence of processing
variations, especially in products made of traditional ceramics.
The frailties that limit the tensile strength of ceramic materials are not nearly so
operative when compressive stresses are applied. Ceramics are substantially stronger in
compression than in tension. For engineering and structural applications, designers have
learned to use ceramic components so that they are loaded in compression rather than
tension or bending.
Various methods have been developed to strengthen ceramics, nearly all of which have
as their fundamental approach the minimization of surface and internal flaws and their
effects. These methods include [7]: (1) making the starting materials more uniform;
(2) decreasing grain size in polycrystalline ceramic products; (3) minimizing porosity;
(4) introducing compressive surface stresses, for example, through application of glazes
with low thermal expansions, so that the body of the product contracts after firing more
than the glaze, thus putting the glaze in compression; (5) using fiber reinforcement; and
(6) heat treatments, such as quenching alumina from temperatures in the slightly plastic
region to strengthen it.

7.1.2 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Several of the physical properties of ceramics are presented in Table 7.2. Most ceramic
materials are lighter than metals and heavier than polymers (see Table 4.1). Melting
temperatures are higher than for most metals, some ceramics preferring to decompose
rather than melt.
Electrical and thermal conductivities of most ceramics are lower than for metals; but
the range of values is greater, permitting some ceramics to be used as insulators while others
are electrical conductors. Thermal expansion coefficients are somewhat less than for the
metals, but the effects are more damaging in ceramics because of their brittleness. Ceramic
materials with relatively high thermal expansions and low thermal conductivities are
especially susceptible to failures of this type, which result from significant temperature
gradients and associated volumetric changes in different regions of the same part. The
terms thermal shock and thermal cracking are used in connection with such failures.
Certain glasses (for example, those containing high proportions of SiO2) and glass ceramics
are noted for their low thermal expansion and are particularly resistant to these thermal
failures (Pyrex is a familiar example).

7.2

TRADITIONAL CERAMICS
These materials are based on mineral silicates, silica, and mineral oxides. The primary
products are fired clay (pottery, tableware, brick, and tile), cement, and natural abrasives
such as alumina. These products, and the processes used to make them, date back thousands
of years (see Historical Note 7.1). Glass is also a silicate ceramic material and is often
included within the traditional ceramics group [5], [6]. We cover glass in a later section
because it is distinguished from the above crystalline materials by its amorphous or vitreous
structure (the term vitreous means glassy, or possessing the characteristics of glass).

7.2.1 RAW MATERIALS
Mineral silicates, such as clays of various compositions, and silica, such as quartz, are among
the most abundant substances in nature and constitute the principal raw materials for

Ancient pottery ceramics

aking pottery has been an art since the earliest
civilizations. Archeologists examine ancient pottery and
similar artifacts to study the cultures of the ancient world.
Ceramic pottery does not corrode or disintegrate with age
nearly as rapidly as artifacts made of wood, metal, or cloth.
Somehow, early tribes discovered that clay is
transformed into a hard solid when placed near an open
fire. Burnt clay articles have been found in the Middle
East that date back nearly 10,000 years. Earthenware pots
and similar products became an established commercial
trade in Egypt by around 4000 BCE.

The greatest advances in pottery making were made
in China, where fine white stoneware was first crafted as
early as 1400 BCE. By the ninth century, the Chinese were
making articles of porcelain, which was fired at higher
temperatures than earthenware or stoneware to partially
vitrify the more complex mixture of raw materials and
produce translucency in the final product. Dinnerware
made of Chinese porcelain was highly valued in Europe;
it was called ‘‘china.’’ It contributed significantly to trade
between China and Europe and influenced the
development of European culture.

traditional ceramics. These solid crystalline compounds have been formed and mixed in the
Earth’s crust over billions of years by complex geological processes.
The clays are the raw materials used most widely in ceramics. They consist of fine
particles of hydrous aluminum silicate that become a plastic substance that is formable and
moldable when mixed with water. The most common clays are based on the mineral
kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). Other clay minerals vary in composition, both in terms of
proportions of the basic ingredients and through additions of other elements such as
magnesium, sodium, and potassium.
Besides its plasticity when mixed with water, a second characteristic of clay that
makes it so useful is that it fuses into a dense, strong material when heated to a sufficiently
elevated temperature. The heat treatment is known as firing. Suitable firing temperatures
depend on clay composition. Thus, clay can be shaped while wet and soft, and then fired to
obtain the final hard ceramic product.
Silica (SiO2) is another major raw material for the traditional ceramics. It is the
principal component in glass, and an important ingredient in other ceramic products
including whiteware, refractories, and abrasives. Silica is available naturally in various
forms, the most important of which is quartz. The main source of quartz is sandstone. The
abundance of sandstone and its relative ease of processing means that silica is low in cost; it
is also hard and chemically stable. These features account for its widespread use in ceramic
products. It is generally mixed in various proportions with clay and other minerals to
achieve the appropriate characteristics in the final product. Feldspar is one of the other
minerals often used. Feldspar refers to any of several crystalline minerals that consist of
aluminum silicate combined with either potassium, sodium, calcium, or barium. The
potassium blend, for example, has the chemical composition KAlSi3O8. Mixtures of
clay, silica, and feldspar are used to make stoneware, china, and other tableware.
Still another important raw material for traditional ceramics is alumina. Most alumina
is processed from the mineral bauxite, which is an impure mixture of hydrous aluminum
oxide and aluminum hydroxide plus similar compounds of iron or manganese. Bauxite is also
the principal ore in the production of aluminum metal. A purer but less common form of
Al2O3 is the mineral corundum, which contains alumina in massive amounts. Slightly impure
forms of corundum crystals are the colored gemstones sapphire and ruby. Alumina ceramic is
used as an abrasive in grinding wheels and as a refractory brick in furnaces.
Silicon carbide, also used as an abrasive, does not occur as a mineral. Instead, it is
produced by heating mixtures of sand (source of silicon) and coke (carbon) to a temperature of around 2200 C (4000 F), so that the resulting chemical reaction forms SiC and
carbon monoxide.

7.2.2 TRADITIONAL CERAMIC PRODUCTS
The minerals discussed above are the ingredients for a variety of ceramic products. We
organize our coverage here by major categories of traditional ceramic products. A summary
of these products, and the raw materials and ceramics out of which they are made, is
presented in Table 7.3. We limit our coverage to materials commonly in with manufactured
products, thus omitting certain commercially important ceramics such as cement.
Pottery and Tableware This category is one of the oldest, dating back thousands of
years; yet it is still one of the most important. It includes tableware products that we all use:
earthenware, stoneware, and china. The raw materials for these products are clay usually
combined with other minerals such as silica and feldspar. The wetted mixture is shaped and
then fired to produce the finished piece.
Earthenware is the least refined of the group; it includes pottery and similar articles
made in ancient times. Earthenware is relatively porous and is often glazed. Glazing
involves application of a surface coating, usually a mixture of oxides such as silica and
alumina, to make the product less pervious to moisture and more attractive to the eye.
Stoneware has lower porosity than earthenware, resulting from closer control of ingredients
and higher firing temperatures. China is fired at even higher temperatures, which produces
the translucence in the finished pieces that characterize their fine quality. The reason for this
is that much of the ceramic material has been converted to the glassy (vitrified) phase, which
is relatively transparent compared to the polycrystalline form. Modern porcelain is nearly
the same as china and is produced by firing the components, mainly clay, silica, and feldspar,
at still higher temperatures to achieve a very hard, dense, glassy material. Porcelain is used in
a variety of products ranging from electrical insulation to bathtub coatings.
Brick and Tile Building brick, clay pipe, unglazed roof tile, and drain tile are made from
various low-cost clays containing silica and gritty matter widely available in natural deposits.
These products are shaped by pressing (molding) and firing at relatively low temperatures.
Refractories Refractory ceramics, often in the form of bricks, are critical in many
industrial processes that require furnaces and crucibles to heat and/or melt materials.
The useful properties of refractory materials are high temperature resistance, thermal
insulation, and resistance to chemical reaction with the materials (usually molten metals)
being heated. As we have mentioned, alumina is often used as a refractory ceramic, together
with silica. Other refractory materials include magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide
(CaO). The refractory lining often contains two layers, the outside layer being more porous
because this increases the insulation properties.
Abrasives Traditional ceramics used for abrasive products, such as grinding wheels and
sandpaper, are alumina and silicon carbide. Although SiC is the harder material (hardness
of SiC is 2600 HV vs. 2200 HV for alumina), the majority of grinding wheels are based on

7.3.2 CARBIDES
The carbide ceramics include silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide
(TiC), tantalum carbide (TaC), and chromium carbide (Cr3C2). Silicon carbide was discussed
previously. Although it is a man-made ceramic, the methods for its production were
developed a century ago, and therefore it is generally included in the traditional ceramics
group. In addition to its use as an abrasive, other SiC applications include resistance heating
elements and additives in steelmaking.
WC, TiC, and TaC are valued for their hardness and wear resistance in cutting tools
and other applications requiring these properties. Tungsten carbide was the first to be
developed (Historical Note 7.2) and is the most important and widely used material in the
group. WC is typically produced by carburizing tungsten powders that have been reduced
from tungsten ores such as wolframite (FeMnWO4) and scheelite (CaWO4). Titanium
carbide is produced by carburizing the minerals rutile (TiO2) or ilmenite (FeTiO3). And
tantalum carbide is made by carburizing either pure tantalum powders or tantalum
pentoxide (Ta2O5) [11]. Chromium carbide is more suited to applications where chemical
stability and oxidation resistance are important. Cr3C2 is prepared by carburizing chromium
oxide (Cr2O3) as the starting compound. Carbon black is the usual source of carbon in all of
these reactions.

Historical Note 7.2

T

Tungsten carbide

he compound WC does not occur in nature. It was first
fabricated in the late 1890s by the Frenchman Henri
Moissan. However, the technological and commercial
importance of the development was not recognized for
two decades.
Tungsten became an important metal for incandescent
lamp filaments in the early 1900s. Wire drawing was
required to produce the filaments. The traditional tool
steel draw dies of the period were unsatisfactory for
drawing tungsten wire due to excessive wear. There was a
need for a much harder material. The compound WC was
known to possess such hardness. In 1914 in Germany,
H. Voigtlander and H. Lohmann developed a fabrication
process for hard carbide draw dies by sintering parts
pressed from powders of tungsten carbide and/or
molybdenum carbide. Lohmann is credited with the first
commercial production of sintered carbides.
The breakthrough leading to the modern technology
of cemented carbides is linked to the work of K. Schroter
in Germany in the early and mid-1920s. He used WC

powders mixed with about 10% of a metal from the iron
group, finally settling on cobalt as the best binder, and
sintering the mixture at a temperature close to the
melting point of the metal. The hard material was first
marketed in Germany as ‘‘Widia’’ in 1926. The Schroter
patents were assigned to the General Electric Company
under the trade name ‘‘Carboloy’’—first produced in the
United States around 1928.
Widia and Carboloy were used as cutting tool
materials, with cobalt content in the range 4% to 13%.
They were effective in the machining of cast iron and
many nonferrous metals, but not in the cutting of steel.
When steel was machined, the tools would wear rapidly
by cratering. In the early 1930s, carbide cutting tool
grades with WC and TiC were developed for steel
cutting. In 1931, the German firm Krupp started
production of Widia X, which had a composition 84%
WC, 10% TiC, and 6% cobalt (Co). And Carboloy Grade
831 was introduced in the United States in 1932; it
contained 69% WC, 21% TiC, and 10% Co.

Except for SiC, each carbide discussed here must be combined with a metallic binder
such as cobalt or nickel in order to fabricate a useful solid product. In effect, the carbide
powders bonded in a metal framework creates what is known as a cemented carbide—a
composite material, specifically a cermet (reduced from ceramic and metal). We examine
cemented carbides and other cermets in Section 9.2.1. The carbides have little engineering
value except as constituents in a composite system.

7.3.3 NITRIDES
The important nitride ceramics are silicon nitride (Si3N4), boron nitride (BN), and titanium
nitride (TiN). As a group, the nitride ceramics are hard and brittle, and they melt at high
temperatures (but not generally as high as the carbides). They are usually electrically
insulating, except for TiN.
Silicon nitride shows promise in high temperature structural applications. Si3N4
oxidizes at about 1200 C (2200 F) and chemically decomposes at around 1900 C (3400 F).
It has low thermal expansion, good resistance to thermal shock and creep, and resists
corrosion by molten nonferrous metals. These properties have provided applications for this
ceramic in gas turbines, rocket engines, and melting crucibles.
Boron nitride exists in several structures, similar to carbon. The important forms of BN
are (1) hexagonal, similar to graphite; and (2) cubic, same as diamond; in fact, its hardness is
comparable to that of diamond. This latter structure goes by the names cubic boron nitride
and borazon, symbolized cBN, and is produced by heating hexagonal BN under very high
pressures. Owing to its extreme hardness, the principal applications of cBN are in cutting tools
(Section 23.2.5) and abrasive wheels (Section 25.1.1). Interestingly, it does not compete with
diamond cutting tools and grinding wheels. Diamond is suited to nonsteel machining and
grinding, while cBN is appropriate for steel.
Titanium nitride has properties similar to those of other nitrides in this group, except
for its electrical conductivity; it is a conductor. TiN has high hardness, good wear resistance,
and a low coefficient of friction with the ferrous metals. This combination of properties
makes TiN an ideal material as a surface coating on cutting tools. The coating is only around
0.006 mm (0.00024 in) thick, so the amounts of material used in this application are low.
A new ceramic material related to the nitride group, and also to the oxides, is the
oxynitride ceramic called sialon. It consists of the elements silicon, aluminum, oxygen, and
nitrogen; and its name derives from these ingredients: Si-Al-O-N. Its chemical composition
is variable, a typical composition being Si4Al2O2N6. Properties of sialon are similar to those
of silicon nitride, but it has better resistance to oxidation at high temperatures than Si3N4.
Its principal application is for cutting tools, but its properties may make it suitable for other
high temperature applications in the future.

7.4

GLASS
The term glass is somewhat confusing because it describes a state of matter as well as a type
of ceramic. As a state of matter, the term refers to an amorphous, or noncrystalline,
structure of a solid material. The glassy state occurs in a material when insufficient time is
allowed during cooling from the molten condition for the crystalline structure to form. It
turns out that all three categories of engineering materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers)
can assume the glassy state, although the circumstances for metals to do so are quite rare.
As a type of ceramic, glass is an inorganic, nonmetallic compound (or mixture of
compounds) that cools to a rigid condition without crystallizing; it is a ceramic that is in
the glassy state as a solid material. This is the material we shall discuss in this section—a
material that dates back 4500 years (Historical Note 7.3).

7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS
The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is silica, most commonly found as the mineral
quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crystalline substance; but
when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass has a very low thermal
expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to thermal shock. These properties are

History of glass

T he oldest glass specimens, dating from around 2500
BCE,

are glass beads and other simple shapes found in
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. These were made by
painstakingly sculpturing glass solids, rather than by
molding or shaping molten glass. It was a thousand years
before the ancient cultures exploited the fluid properties
of hot glass, by pouring it in successive layers over a sand
core until sufficient thickness and rigidity had been
attained in the product, a cup-shaped vessel. This
pouring technique was used until around 200 BCE, when
a simple tool was developed that revolutionized
glassworking—the blowpipe.
Glassblowing was probably first accomplished in
Babylon and later by the Romans. It was performed using
an iron tube several feet long, with a mouthpiece on one

end and a fixture for holding the molten glass on the
other. A blob of hot glass in the required initial shape and
viscosity was attached to the end of the iron tube, and
then blown into shape by an artisan either freely in air or
into a mold cavity. Other simple tools were utilized to
add the stem and/or base to the object.
The ancient Romans showed great skill in their use
of various metallic oxides to color glass. Their
technology is evident in the stained glass windows of
cathedrals and churches of the Middle Ages in Italy
and the rest of Europe. The art of glassblowing is still
practiced today for certain consumer glassware; and
automated versions of glassblowing are used for massproduced glass products such as bottles and light
bulbs (Chapter 12).

ideal for elevated temperature applications; accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware
designed for heating are made with high proportions of silica glass.
In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to control
properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides as well as
silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usually comprising
50% to 75% of total chemistry. The reason SiO2 is used so widely in these compositions is
because it is the best glass former. It naturally transforms into a glassy state upon cooling
from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical

chemistries for some common glasses. The additional ingredients are contained in a solid
solution with SiO2, and each has a function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during
heating; (2) increasing fluidity in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding devitrification—the tendency to crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal
expansion in the final product; (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by
acids, basic substances, or water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of
refraction for optical applications (e.g., lenses).

7.4.2 GLASS PRODUCTS
Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. We examine the roles played
by the different ingredients in Table 7.4 as we discuss these products.
Window Glass This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-lime
glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blowing industry
of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda (Na2O) and lime (CaO) with
silica (SiO2) as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has evolved empirically to
achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during cooling and achieving chemical
durability of the final product. Modern window glass and the techniques for making it have
required slight adjustments in composition and closer control over its variation. Magnesia
(MgO) has been added to help reduce devitrification.
Containers In previous times, the same basic soda-lime composition was used for manual
glass-blowing to make bottles and other containers. Modern processes for shaping glass
containers cool the glass more rapidly than older methods. Also, the importance of chemical
stability in container glass is better understood today. Resulting changes in composition have
attempted to optimize the proportions of lime (CaO) and soda (Na2O3). Lime promotes
fluidity. It also increases devitrification, but since cooling is more rapid, this effect is not as
important as in prior processing techniques with slower cooling rates. Soda reduces chemical
instability and solubility of the container glass.
Light Bulb Glass Glass used in light bulbs and other thin glass items (e.g., drinking
glasses, Christmas ornaments) is high in soda and low in lime; it also contains small amounts
of magnesia and alumina. The chemistry is dictated largely by the economics of large
volumes involved in light bulb manufacture. The raw materials are inexpensive and suited
to the continuous melting furnaces used today.
Laboratory Glassware These products include containers for chemicals (e.g., flasks,
beakers, glass tubing). The glass must be resistant to chemical attack and thermal shock.
Glass that is high in silica is suitable because of its low thermal expansion. The trade name
‘‘Vicor’’ is used for this high-silica glass. This product is very insoluble in water and acids.
Additions of boric oxide also produce a glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion, so some
glass for laboratory ware contains B2O3 in amounts of around 13%. The trade name ‘‘Pyrex’’ is used
for the borosilicate glass developed by the Corning Glass Works. Both Vicor and Pyrex are included
in our listing as examples of this product category.
Glass Fibers Glass fibers are manufactured for a number of important applications,
including fiberglass reinforced plastics, insulation wool, and fiber optics. The compositions
vary according to function. The most commonly used glass reinforcing fibers in plastics are
E-glass. It is high in CaO and Al2O3 content, it is economical, and it possesses good tensile
strength in fiber form. Another glass fiber material is S-glass, which has higher strength but
is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are indicated in our table.

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica
glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass
with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The inside
glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long distance
communication.
Optical Glasses Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and optical
instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their function, the
glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be homogenous in
composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and flints. Crown glass
has a low index of refraction, while flint glass contains lead oxide (PbO) that gives it a
high index of refraction.

7.4.3 GLASS-CERAMICS
Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into a
polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase in the
final product typically ranges between 90% and 98%, with the remainder being unconverted
vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and 1.0 mm (4 and 40 m-in), significantly
smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine crystal microstructure makes
glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from which they are derived. Also, due to
their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque (usually gray or white) rather than clear.
The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step involves
heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create the desired
product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economical than pressing
and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders. (2) The product is
cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature sufficient to cause a dense network of
crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density of nucleation sites that
inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading ultimately to the fine grain size in
the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity for nucleation is the presence of
small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass composition. Common nucleating agents
are TiO2, P2O5, and ZrO2. (4) Once nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued
at a higher temperature to cause growth of the crystalline phases.
Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed in
Table 7.5. The Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system is the most important commercially; it includes
Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.
The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing in
the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3) good
mechanical and physical properties. Properties include high strength (stronger than glass),
absence of porosity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high resistance to thermal

and missile radomes. Certain systems (e.g., MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system) are also characterized by high electrical resistance, suitable for electrical and electronics applications.

7.5

SOME IMPORTANT ELEMENTS RELATED TO CERAMICS
In this section, several elements of engineering importance are discussed: carbon, silicon,
and boron. We encounter these materials on occasion in subsequent chapters. Although
they are not ceramic materials according to our definition, they sometimes compete for
applications with ceramics. And they have important applications of their own. Basic data
on these elements are presented in Table 7.6.

7.5.1 CARBON
Carbon occurs in two alternative forms of engineering and commercial importance: graphite
and diamond. They compete with ceramics in various applications: graphite in situations
where its refractory properties are important, and diamond in industrial applications where
hardness is the critical factor (such as cutting and grinding tools).
Graphite Graphite has a high content of crystalline carbon in the form of layers. Bonding
between atoms in the layers is covalent and therefore strong, but the parallel layers are
bonded to each other by weak van der Waals forces. This structure makes graphite quite
anisotropic; strength and other properties vary significantly with direction. It explains why
graphite can be used both as a lubricant and as a fiber in advanced composite materials. In
powder form, graphite possesses low frictional characteristics due to the ease with which it
shears between the layers; in this form, graphite is valued as a lubricant. In fiber form,
graphite is oriented in the hexagonal planar direction to produce a filament material of very
high strength and elastic modulus. These graphite fibers are used in structural composites
ranging from tennis rackets to fighter aircraft components.
Graphite exhibits certain high temperature properties that are both useful and
unusual. It is resistant to thermal shock, and its strength actually increases with temperature. Tensile strength at room temperature is about 100 MPa (14,500 lb/in2), but increases to
about twice this value at 2500 C (4500 F) [5]. Theoretical density of carbon is 2.22 g/cm3,
but apparent density of bulk graphite is lower due to porosity (around 1.7 g/cm3). This is

7.5.2 SILICON
Silicon is a semimetallic element in the same group in the periodic table as carbon (Figure
2.1). Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth’s crust, comprising about
26% by weight (Table 7.1). It occurs naturally only as a chemical compound—in rocks,
sand, clay, and soil—either as silicon dioxide or as more complex silicate compounds. As
an element it has the same crystalline structure as diamond, but its hardness is lower. It is
hard but brittle, lightweight, chemically inactive at room temperature, and is classified as
a semiconductor.
The greatest amounts of silicon in manufacturing are in ceramic compounds (SiO2 in
glass and silicates in clays) and alloying elements in steel, aluminum, and copper alloys. It is
also used as a reducing agent in certain metallurgical processes. Of significant technological
importance is pure silicon as the base material in semiconductor manufacturing in
electronics. The vast majority of integrated circuits produced today are made from silicon
(Chapter 34).

7.5.3 BORON
Boron is a semimetallic element in the same periodic group as aluminum. It is only about
0.001% of the Earth’s crust by weight, commonly occurring as the minerals borax
(Na2B4O7–10H2O) and kernite (Na2B4O7–4H2O). Boron is lightweight and very stiff
(high modulus of elasticity) in fiber form. In terms of electrical properties, it is classified
as a semiconductor (its conductivity varies with temperature; it is an insulator at low
temperatures but a conductor at high temperatures).
As a material of industrial significance, boron is usually found in compound form. As
such, it is used as a solution in nickel electroplating operations, an ingredient (B2O3) in
certain glass compositions, a catalyst in organic chemical reactions, and as a nitride (cubic
boron nitride) for cutting tools. In nearly pure form it is used as a fiber in composite
materials (Sections 9.4.1 and 15.1.2).

GUIDE TO PROCESSING CERAMICS
The processing of ceramics can be divided into two basic categories: molten ceramics and
particulate ceramics. The major category of molten ceramics is glassworking (Chapter
12). Particulate ceramics include traditional and new ceramics; their processing methods
constitute most of the rest of the shaping technologies for ceramics (Chapter 17).
Cermets, such as cemented carbides, are a special case because they are metal matrix
composites (Section 17.3). Table 7.7 provides a guide to the processing of ceramic
materials and the elements carbon, silicon, and boron.

8.6 Guide to the Processing of Polymers

Of the three basic types of materials, polymers are the newest
and at the same time the oldest known to man. Polymers form
the living organisms and vital processes of all life on Earth. To
ancient man, biological polymers were the source of food,
shelter, and many of his implements. However, our interest in
this chapter is in polymers other than biological. With the
exception of natural rubber, nearly all of the polymeric
materials used in engineering today are synthetic. The materials themselves are made by chemical processing, and most of
the products are made by solidification processes.
A polymer is a compound consisting of long-chain
molecules, each molecule made up of repeating units connected together. There may be thousands, even millions of
units in a single polymer molecule. The word is derived from
the Greek words poly, meaning many, and meros (reduced to
mer), meaning part. Most polymers are based on carbon and
are therefore considered organic chemicals.
Polymers can be separated into plastics and rubbers. As
engineering materials, they are relatively new compared to
metals and ceramics, dating only from around the mid-1800s
(Historical Note 8.1). For our purposes in covering polymers
as a technical subject, it is appropriate to divide them into the
following three categories, where (1) and (2) are plastics and
(3) is the rubber category:

1. Thermoplastic polymers, also called thermoplastics (TP),
are solid materials at room temperature, but they become
viscous liquids when heated to temperatures of only a few
hundred degrees. This characteristic allows them to be
easily and economically shaped into products. They can be
subjected to this heating and cooling cycle repeatedly
without significant degradation of the polymer.
2. Thermosetting polymers, or thermosets (TS), cannot tolerate repeated heating cycles as thermoplastics can. When
initially heated, they soften and flow for molding, but the
elevated temperatures also produce a chemical reaction

Historical Note 8.1

C

History of polymers

ertainly one of the milestones in the history of
polymers was Charles Goodyear’s discovery of vulcanization of rubber in 1839 (Historical Note 8.2). In 1851,
his brother Nelson patented hard rubber, called ebonite,
which in reality is a thermosetting polymer. It was used
for many years for combs, battery cases, and dental
prostheses.
At the 1862 International Exhibition in London, an
English chemist Alexander Parkes demonstrated the
possibilities of the first thermoplastic, a form of cellulose
nitrate (cellulose is a natural polymer in wood and
cotton). He called it Parkesine and described it as a
replacement for ivory and tortoiseshell. The material
became commercially important due to the efforts of
American John W. Hyatt, Jr., who combined cellulose
nitrate and camphor (which acts as a plasticizer) together
with heat and pressure to form the product he called
Celluloid. His patent was issued in 1870. Celluloid
plastic was transparent, and the applications
subsequently developed for it included photographic
and motion picture film and windshields for carriages
and early motorcars.
Several additional products based on cellulose were
developed around the turn of the last century. Cellulose
fibers, called Rayon, were first produced around 1890.
Packaging film, called Cellophane, was first marketed
around 1910. Cellulose acetate was adopted as the base
for photographic film around the same time. This
material was to become an important thermoplastic for
injection molding during the next several decades.
The first synthetic plastic was developed in the early
1900s by the Belgian-born American chemist L. H.
Baekeland. It involved the reaction and polymerization

of phenol and formaldehyde to form what its inventor
called Bakelite. This thermosetting resin is still
commercially important today. It was followed by other
similar polymers: urea-formaldehyde in 1918 and
melamineformaldehyde in 1939.
The late 1920s and 1930s saw the development of a
number of thermoplastics of major importance today.
A Russian I. Ostromislensky had patented polyvinylchloride in 1912, but it was first commercialized in 1927
as a wall covering. Around the same time, polystyrene
was first produced in Germany. In England, fundamental
research was started in 1932 that led to the synthesis of
polyethylene; the first production plant came on line just
before the outbreak of World War II. This was low
density polyethylene. Finally, a major research program
initiated in 1928 under the direction of W. Carothers at
DuPont in the United States led to the synthesis of the
polyamide nylon; it was commercialized in the late
1930s. Its initial use was in ladies’ hosiery; subsequent
applications during the war included low-friction
bearings and wire insulation. Similar efforts in Germany
provided an alternative form of nylon in 1939.
Several important special-purpose polymers were
developed in the 1940s: fluorocarbons (Teflon),
silicones, and polyurethanes in 1943; epoxy resins in
1947, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer
(ABS) in 1948. During the 1950s: polyester fibers in
1950; and polypropylene, polycarbonate, and highdensity polyethylene in 1957. Thermoplastic elastomers
were first developed in the 1960s. The ensuing years
have witnessed a tremendous growth in the use of
plastics.

that hardens the material into an infusible solid. If reheated, thermosetting polymers
degrade and char rather than soften.
3. Elastomers are the rubbers. Elastomers (E) are polymers that exhibit extreme elastic
extensibility when subjected to relatively low mechanical stress. Some elastomers can
be stretched by a factor of 10 and yet completely recover to their original shape.
Although their properties are quite different from thermosets, they have a similar
molecular structure that is different from the thermoplastics.
Thermoplastics are commercially the most important of the three types, constituting
around 70% of the tonnage of all synthetic polymers produced. Thermosets and elastomers
share the remaining 30% about evenly, with a slight edge for the former. Common TP
polymers include polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, and nylon.
Examples of TS polymers are phenolics, epoxies, and certain polyesters. The most common
example given for elastomers is natural (vulcanized) rubber; however, synthetic rubbers
exceed the tonnage of natural rubber.

Although the classification of polymers into the TP, TS, and E categories suits our
purposes for organizing the topic in this chapter, we should note that the three types
sometimes overlap. Certain polymers that are normally thermoplastic can be made into
thermosets. Some polymers can be either thermosets or elastomers (we indicated that their
molecular structures are similar). And some elastomers are thermoplastic. However, these
are exceptions to the general classification scheme.
The growth in applications of synthetic polymers is truly impressive. On a
volumetric basis, current annual usage of polymers exceeds that of metals. There are
several reasons for the commercial and technological importance of polymers:
å Plastics can be formed by molding into intricate part geometries, usually with no
further processing required. They are very compatible with net shape processing.
å Plastics possess an attractive list of properties for many engineering applications where
strength is not a factor: (1) low density relative to metals and ceramics; (2) good
strength-to-weight ratios for certain (but not all) polymers; (3) high corrosion resistance; and (4) low electrical and thermal conductivity.
å On a volumetric basis, polymers are cost-competitive with metals.
å On a volumetric basis, polymers generally require less energy to produce than metals.
This is generally true because the temperatures for working these materials are much
lower than for metals.
å Certain plastics are translucent and/or transparent, which makes them competitive
with glass in some applications.
å Polymers are widely used in composite materials (Chapter 9).
On the negative side, polymers in general have the following limitations: (1) strength
is low relative to metals and ceramics; (2) modulus of elasticity or stiffness is also low—in the
case of elastomers, of course, this may be a desirable characteristic; (3) service temperatures
are limited to only a few hundred degrees because of the softening of thermoplastic
polymers or degradation of thermosetting polymers and elastomers; (4) some polymers
degrade when subjected to sunlight and other forms of radiation; and (5) plastics exhibit
viscoelastic properties (Section 3.5), which can be a distinct limitation in load bearing
applications.
In this chapter we examine the technology of polymeric materials. The first section is
devoted to an introductory discussion of polymer science and technology. Subsequent
sections survey the three basic categories of polymers: thermoplastics, thermosets, and
elastomers.

8.1

FUNDAMENTALS OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very large
molecules, called macromolecules, that possess a chain-like structure. The small units,
called monomers, are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules such as ethylene
(C2H4). The atoms in these molecules are held together by covalent bonds; and when joined
to form the polymer, the same covalent bonding holds the links of the chain together. Thus,
each large molecule is characterized by strong primary bonding. Synthesis of the polyethylene molecule is depicted in Figure 8.1. As we have described its structure here,
polyethylene is a linear polymer; its mers form one long chain.
A mass of polymer material consists of many macromolecules; the analogy of a bowl
of just-cooked spaghetti (without sauce) is sometimes used to visualize the relationship of
the individual molecules to the bulk material. Entanglement among the long strands helps

to hold the mass together, but atomic bonding is more significant. The bonding between
macromolecules in the mass is due to van der Waals and other secondary bonding types.
Thus, the aggregate polymer material is held together by forces that are substantially
weaker than the primary bonds holding the molecules together. This explains why plastics
in general are not nearly as stiff and strong as metals or ceramics.
When a thermoplastic polymer is heated, it softens. The heat energy causes the
macromolecules to become thermally agitated, exciting them to move relative to each
other within the polymer mass (here, the wet spaghetti analogy loses its appeal). The
material begins to behave like a viscous liquid, viscosity decreasing (fluidity increasing)
with rising temperature.
Let us expand on these opening remarks, tracing how polymers are synthesized and
examining the characteristics of the materials that result from the synthesis.

8.1.1 POLYMERIZATION
As a chemical process, the synthesis of polymers can occur by either of two methods:
(1) addition polymerization and (2) step polymerization. Production of a given polymer is
generally associated with one method or the other.
Addition Polymerization In this process, exemplified by polyethylene, the double bonds
between carbon atoms in the ethylene monomers are induced to open so that they join with
other monomer molecules. The connections occur on both ends of the expanding macromolecule, developing long chains of repeating mers. Because of the way the molecules are
formed, the process is also known as chain polymerization. It is initiated using a chemical
catalyst (called an initiator) to open the carbon double bond in some of the monomers.
These monomers, which are now highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then
capture other monomers to begin forming chains that are reactive. The chains propagate by
capturing still other monomers, one at a time, until large molecules have been produced and
the reaction is terminated. The process proceeds as indicated in Figure 8.2. The entire
polymerization reaction takes only seconds for any given macromolecule. However, in the
industrial process, it may take many minutes or even hours to complete the polymerization
of a given batch, since all of the chain reactions do not occur simultaneously in the mixture.

Other polymers typically formed by addition polymerization are presented in Figure 8.3, along with the starting monomer and the repeating mer. Note that the chemical
formula for the monomer is the same as that of the mer in the polymer. This is a characteristic
of this method of polymerization. Note also that many of the common polymers involve
substitution of some alternative atom or molecule in place of one of the H atoms in
polyethylene. Polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and polystyrene are examples of this substitution. Polytetrafluoroethylene replaces all four H atoms in the structure with atoms of
fluorine (F). Most addition polymers are thermoplastics. The exception in Figure 8.3 is
polyisoprene, the polymer of natural rubber. Although formed by addition polymerization, it
is an elastomer.
Step Polymerization In this form of polymerization, two reacting monomers are brought
together to form a new molecule of the desired compound. In most (but not all) step
polymerization processes, a byproduct of the reaction is also produced. The byproduct is
typically water, which condenses; hence, the term condensation polymerization is often used
for processes that yield the condensate. As the reaction continues, more molecules of the
reactants combine with the molecules first synthesized to form polymers of length n ¼ 2, then
polymers of length n ¼ 3, and so on. Polymers of increasing n are created in a slow, stepwise
fashion. In addition to this gradual elongation of the molecules, intermediate polymers of
length n1 and n2 also combine to form molecules of length n ¼ n1 + n2, so that two types of
reactions are proceeding simultaneously once the process is under way, as illustrated in
Figure 8.4. Accordingly, at any point in the process, the batch contains polymers of various
lengths. Only after sufficient time has elapsed are molecules of adequate length formed.

It should be noted that water is not always the byproduct of the reaction; for
example, ammonia (NH3) is another simple compound produced in some reactions.
Nevertheless, the term condensation polymerization is still used. It should also be noted
that although most step polymerization processes involve condensation of a byproduct,
some do not. Examples of commercial polymers produced by step (condensation)
polymerization are given in Figure 8.5. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers
are synthesized by this method; nylon-6,6 and polycarbonate are TP polymers, while
phenol formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde are TS polymers.

material vary in length, n for the batch is an average; its statistical distribution is normal. The
mean value of n is called the degree of polymerization (DP) for the batch. The degree of
polymerization affects the properties of the polymer: higher DP increases mechanical
strength but also increases viscosity in the fluid state, which makes processing more difficult.
The molecular weight (MW) of a polymer is the sum of the molecular weights of
the mers in the molecule; it is n times the molecular weight of each repeating unit. Since n
varies for different molecules in a batch, the molecule weight must be interpreted as an
average. Typical values of DP and MW for selected polymers are presented in Table 8.1.

8.1.2 POLYMER STRUCTURES AND COPOLYMERS
There are structural differences among polymer molecules, even molecules of the same
polymer. In this section we examine three aspects of molecular structure: (1) stereoregularity, (2) branching and cross-linking, and (3) copolymers.
Stereoregularity Stereoregularity is concerned with the spatial arrangement of the atoms
and groups of atoms in the repeating units of the polymer molecule. An important aspect of
stereoregularity is the way the atom groups are located along the chain for a polymer that has
one of the H atoms in its mers replaced by some other atom or atom group. Polypropylene is
an example; it is similar to polyethylene except that CH3 is substituted for one of the four H
atoms in the mer. Three tactic arrangements are possible, illustrated in Figure 8.6:
(a) isotactic, in which the odd atom groups are all on the same side; (b) syndiotactic, in
which the atom groups alternate on opposite sides; and (c) atactic, in which the groups are
randomly along either side.
The tactic structure is important in determining the properties of the polymer. It
also influences the tendency of a polymer to crystallize (Section 8.1.3). Continuing with

our polypropylene example, this polymer can be synthesized in any of the three tactic
structures. In its isotactic form, it is strong and melts at 175 C (347 F); the syndiotactic
structure is also strong, but melts at 131 C (268 F); but atactic polypropylene is soft and
melts at around 75 C (167 F) and has little commercial use [6], [9].
Linear, Branched, and Cross-Linked Polymers We have described the polymerization
process as yielding macromolecules of a chain-like structure, called a linear polymer. This is
the characteristic structure of a thermoplastic polymer. Other structures are possible, as
portrayed in Figure 8.7. One possibility is for side branches to form along the chain, resulting
in the branched polymer shown in Figure 8.7(b). In polyethylene, this occurs because
hydrogen atoms are replaced by carbon atoms at random points along the chain, initiating
the growth of a branch chain at each location. For certain polymers, primary bonding occurs
between branches and other molecules at certain connection points to form cross-linked
polymers as pictured in Figure 8.7(c) and (d). Cross-linking occurs because a certain
proportion of the monomers used to form the polymer are capable of bonding to adjacent
monomers on more than two sides, thus allowing branches from other molecules to attach.
Lightly cross-linked structures are characteristic of elastomers. When the polymer is highly
cross-linked we refer to it as having a network structure, as in (d); in effect, the entire mass is
one gigantic macromolecule. Thermosetting plastics take this structure after curing.
The presence of branching and cross-linking in polymers has a significant effect on
properties. It is the basis of the difference between the three categories of polymers: TP, TS,
and E. Thermoplastic polymers always possess linear or branched structures, or a mixture of
the two. Branching increases entanglement among the molecules, usually making the
polymer stronger in the solid state and more viscous at a given temperature in the plastic
or liquid state.
Thermosetting plastics and elastomers are cross-linked polymers. Cross-linking
causes the polymer to become chemically set; the reaction cannot be reversed. The effect

is to permanently change the structure of the polymer; upon heating, it degrades or burns
rather than melts. Thermosets possess a high degree of cross-linking, while elastomers
possess a low degree of cross-linking. Thermosets are hard and brittle, while elastomers are
elastic and resilient.
Copolymers Polyethylene is a homopolymer; so are polypropylene, polystyrene, and
many other common plastics; their molecules consist of repeating mers that are all the same
type. Copolymers are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating units of two
different types. An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene and propylene to
produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene-propylene copolymer can
be represented as follows:


(C2 H4 )n (C3 H6 )m 
where n and m range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are
around 50% each. We find in Section 8.4.3 that the combination of polyethylene and
polypropylene with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber.
Copolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers. The
possibilities are shown in Figure 8.8: (a) alternating copolymer, in which the mers repeat
every other place; (b) random, in which the mers are in random order, the frequency
depending on the relative proportions of the starting monomers; (c) block, in which mers of
the same type tend to group themselves into long segments along the chain; and (d) graft, in
which mers of one type are attached as branches to a main backbone of mers of the other
type. The ethylene–propylene diene rubber, mentioned previously, is a block type.
Synthesis of copolymers is analogous to alloying of metals to form solid solutions.
As with metallic alloys, differences in the ingredients and structure of copolymers can
have a substantial effect on properties. An example is the polyethylene–polypropylene
mixture we have been discussing. Each of these polymers alone is fairly stiff; yet a 50–50
mixture forms a copolymer of random structure that is rubbery.
It is also possible to synthesize ternary polymers, or terpolymers, which consist of
mers of three different types. An example is the plastic ABS (acrylonitrile–butadiene–
styrene—no wonder they call it ABS).

8.1.3 CRYSTALLINITY
Both amorphous and crystalline structures are possible with polymers, although the
tendency to crystallize is much less than for metals or nonglass ceramics. Not all polymers
can form crystals. For those that can, the degree of crystallinity (the proportion of

crystallized material in the mass) is always less than 100%. As crystallinity is increased in a
polymer, so are (1) density, (2) stiffness, strength, and toughness, and (3) heat resistance. In
addition, (4) if the polymer is transparent in the amorphous state, it becomes opaque when
partially crystallized. Many polymers are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy)
state. Some of these effects can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and
high-density polyethylene, presented in Table 8.2. The underlying reason for the property
differences between these materials is the degree of crystallinity.
Linear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crystallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains upon
themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in Figure 8.9(a).
The crystallized regions are called crystallites. Owing to the tremendous length of a single
molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than one crystallite. Also, more
than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal region. The crystallites take the form
of lamellae, as pictured in Figure 8.9(b), that are randomly mixed in with the amorphous
material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes is a two-phase system—crystallites interspersed
throughout an amorphous matrix.
A number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form
crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows: (1) as a
general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereoregularity of the molecule is
critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic polymers sometimes form

crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers, due to their molecular
irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes crystal formation and growth,
as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical deformation, as in the stretching of a
heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and increase crystallization; and (6)
plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften it) reduce the degree of crystallinity.

8.1.4 THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS
The thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that of
amorphous polymers (Section 2.4). The effect of structure can be observed on a plot of
specific volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plotted in Figure 8.10.
A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point Tm at which its volume undergoes an abrupt
change. Also, at temperatures above Tm, the thermal expansion of the molten material is
greater than for the solid material below Tm. An amorphous polymer does not undergo the
same abrupt changes at Tm. As it is cooled from the liquid, its coefficient of thermal
expansion continues to decline along the same trajectory as when it was molten, and it
becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature. During cooling below Tm, the
polymer changes from liquid to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is finally
reached at which the thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower.
This is the glass-transition temperature, Tg (Section 3.5), seen as the change in slope. Below
Tg, the material is hard and brittle.
A partially crystallized polymer lies between these two extremes, as indicated in
Figure 8.10. It is an average of the amorphous and crystalline states, the average depending
on the degree of crystallinity. Above Tm it exhibits the viscous characteristics of a liquid;
between Tm and Tg it has viscoelastic properties; and below Tg it has the conventional
elastic properties of a solid.
What we have described in this section applies to thermoplastic materials, which
can move up and down the curve of Figure 8.10 multiple times. The manner in which they
are heated and cooled may change the path that is followed. For example, fast cooling
rates may inhibit crystal formation and increase the glass-transition temperature.
Thermosets and elastomers cooled from the liquid state behave like an amorphous
polymer until cross-linking occurs. Their molecular structure restricts the formation of
crystals. And once their molecules are cross-linked, they cannot be reheated to the
molten state.

8.1.5 ADDITIVES
The properties of a polymer can often be beneficially changed by combining them with
additives. Additives either alter the molecular structure of the polymer or add a second phase
to the plastic, in effect transforming a polymer into a composite material. Additives can be
classified by function as (1) fillers, (2) plasticizers, (3) colorants, (4) lubricants, (5) flame
retardants, (6) cross-linking agents, (7) ultraviolet light absorbers, and (8) antioxidants.
Filler Fillers are solid materials added to a polymer usually in particulate or fibrous form to
alter its mechanical properties or to simply reduce material cost. Other reasons for using
fillers are to improve dimensional and thermal stability. Examples of fillers used in polymers
include cellulosic fibers and powders (e.g., cotton fibers and wood flour, respectively);
powders of silica (SiO2), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and clay (hydrous aluminum silicate);
and fibers of glass, metal, carbon, or other polymers. Fillers that improve mechanical
properties are called reinforcing agents, and composites thus created are referred to as
reinforced plastics; they have higher stiffness, strength, hardness, and toughness than the
original polymer. Fibers provide the greatest strengthening effect.
Plasticizers Plasticizers are chemicals added to a polymer to make it softer and more
flexible, and to improve its flow characteristics during forming. The plasticizer works by
reducing the glass transition temperature to below room temperature. Whereas the
polymer is hard and brittle below Tg, it is soft and tough above it. Addition of a plasticizer1
to polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a good example; depending on the proportion of plasticizer in
the mix, PVC can be obtained in a range of properties, from rigid and brittle to flexible and
rubbery.
Colorants An advantage of many polymers over metals or ceramics is that the material
itself can be obtained in most any color. This eliminates the need for secondary coating
operations. Colorants for polymers are of two types: pigments and dies. Pigments are finely
powdered materials that are insoluble in and must be uniformly distributed throughout the
polymer in very low concentrations, usually less than 1%. They often add opacity as well as
color to the plastic. Dies are chemicals, usually supplied in liquid form, that are generally
soluble in the polymer. They are normally used to color transparent plastics such as styrene
and acrylics.
Other Additives Lubricants are sometimes added to the polymer to reduce friction
and promote flow at the mold interface. Lubricants are also helpful in releasing the part
from the mold in injection molding. Mold-release agents, sprayed onto the mold surface,
are often used for the same purpose.
Nearly all polymers burn if the required heat and oxygen are supplied. Some
polymers are more combustible than others. Flame retardants are chemicals added to
polymers to reduce flammability by any or a combination of the following mechanisms:
(1) interfering with flame propagation, (2) producing large amounts of incombustible gases,
and/or (3) increasing the combustion temperature of the material. The chemicals may also
function to (4) reduce the emission of noxious or toxic gases generated during combustion.
We should include among the additives those that cause cross-linking to occur in
thermosetting polymers and elastomers. The term cross-linking agent refers to a variety of
ingredients that cause a cross-linking reaction or act as a catalyst to promote such a
reaction. Important commercial examples are (1) sulfur in vulcanization of natural rubber,
(2) formaldehyde for phenolics to form phenolic thermosetting plastics, and (3) peroxides
for polyesters.

The common plasticizer in PVC is dioctyl phthalate, a phthalate ester.

Many polymers are susceptible to degradation by ultraviolet light (e.g., from sunlight) and
oxidation. The degradation manifests itself as the breaking of links in the long chain molecules.
Polyethylene, for example, is vulnerable to both types of degradation, which lead to a loss of
mechanical strength. Ultraviolet light absorbers and antioxidants are additives that reduce the
susceptibility of the polymer to these forms of attack.

8.2

THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS
In this section, we discuss the properties of the thermoplastic polymer group and then
survey its important members.

8.2.1 PROPERTIES OF THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS
The defining property of a thermoplastic polymer is that it can be heated from a solid state to
a viscous liquid state and then cooled back down to solid, and that this heating and cooling
cycle can be applied multiple times without degrading the polymer. The reason for this
property is that TP polymers consist of linear (and/or branched) macromolecules that do not
cross-link when heated. By contrast, thermosets and elastomers undergo a chemical change
when heated, which cross-links their molecules and permanently sets these polymers.
In truth, thermoplastics do deteriorate chemically with repeated heating and cooling.
In plastic molding, a distinction is made between new or virgin material, and plastic that has
been previously molded (e.g., sprues, defective parts) and therefore has experienced thermal
cycling. For some applications, only virgin material is acceptable. Thermoplastic polymers
also degrade gradually when subjected to continuous elevated temperatures below Tm. This
long-term effect is called thermal aging and involves slow chemical deterioration. Some TP
polymers are more susceptible to thermal aging than others, and for a given material the rate
of deterioration depends on temperature.
Mechanical Properties In our discussion of mechanical properties in Chapter 3, we
compared polymers to metals and ceramics. The typical thermoplastic at room temperature is characterized by the following: (1) much lower stiffness, the modulus of elasticity
being two (in some cases, three) orders of magnitude lower than metals and ceramics; (2)
lower tensile strength, about 10% of the metals; (3) much lower hardness; and (4) greater
ductility on average, but there is a tremendous range of values, from 1% elongation for
polystyrene to 500% or more for polypropylene.
Mechanical properties of thermoplastics depend on temperature. The functional
relationships must be discussed in the context of amorphous and crystalline structures.
Amorphous thermoplastics are rigid and glass-like below their glass transition temperature
Tg and flexible or rubber-like just above it. As temperature increases above Tg, the polymer
becomes increasingly soft, finally becoming a viscous fluid (it never becomes a thin liquid
due to its high molecular weight). The effect on mechanical behavior can be portrayed as in
Figure 8.11, in which mechanical behavior is defined as deformation resistance. This is
analogous to modulus of elasticity but it allows us to observe the effect of temperature on the
amorphous polymer as it transitions from solid to liquid. Below Tg, the material is elastic and
strong. At Tg, a rather sudden drop in deformation resistance is observed as the material
transforms into its rubbery phase; its behavior is viscoelastic in this region. As temperature
increases, it gradually becomes more fluid-like.
A theoretical thermoplastic with 100% crystallinity would have a distinct melting
point Tm at which it transforms from solid to liquid, but would show no perceptible Tg point.
Of course, real polymers have less than 100% crystallinity. For partially crystallized
polymers, the resistance to deformation is characterized by the curve that lies between

the two extremes, its position determined by the relative proportions of the two phases. The
partially crystallized polymer exhibits features of both amorphous and fully crystallized
plastics. Below Tg, it is elastic with deformation resistance sloping downward with rising
temperatures. Above Tg, the amorphous portions of the polymer soften, while the crystalline portions remain intact. The bulk material exhibits properties that are generally
viscoelastic. As Tm is reached, the crystals now melt, giving the polymer a liquid consistency;
resistance to deformation is now due to the fluid’s viscous properties. The degree to which
the polymer assumes liquid characteristics at and above Tm depends on molecular weight
and degree of polymerization. Higher DP and MW reduce flow of the polymer, making it
more difficult to process by molding and similar shaping methods. This is a dilemma faced by
those who select these materials because higher MW and DP mean higher strength.
Physical Properties Physical properties of materials are discussed in Chapter 4. In
general, thermoplastic polymers have the following characteristics: (1) lower densities
than metals or ceramics—typical specific gravities for polymers are around 1.2, for ceramics
around 2.5, and for metals around 7.0; (2) much higher coefficient of thermal expansion—
roughly 5 times the value for metals and 10 times the value for ceramics; (3) much lower
melting temperatures; (4) specific heats that are 2 to 4 times those of metals and ceramics;
(5) thermal conductivities that are about three orders of magnitude lower than those of
metals; and (6) insulating electrical properties.

8.2.2 IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL THERMOPLASTICS
Thermoplastic products include molded and extruded items, fibers, films, sheets, packaging
materials, paints, and varnishes. The starting raw materials for these products are normally
supplied to the fabricator in the form of powders or pellets in bags, drums, or larger loads by
truck or rail car. The most important TP polymers are discussed in alphabetical order in this
section. For each plastic, Table 8.3 lists the chemical formula and selected properties.
Approximate market share is given relative to all plastics (thermoplastic and thermosetting).
Acetals Acetal is the popular name given to polyoxymethylene, an engineering polymer
prepared from formaldehyde (CH2O) with high stiffness, strength, toughness, and wear
resistance. In addition, it has a high melting point, low moisture absorption, and is insoluble

resins are competitive with certain metals (e.g., brass and zinc) in automotive components such
as door handles, pump housings, and similar parts; appliance hardware; and machinery
components.
Acrylics The acrylics are polymers derived from acrylic acid (C3H4O2) and compounds
originating from it. The most important thermoplastic in the acrylics group is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or Plexiglas (Rohm & Haas’s trade name for PMMA). Data on
PMMA are listed in Table 8.3(b). It is an amorphous linear polymer. Its outstanding property
is excellent transparency, which makes it competitive with glass in optical applications.
Examples include automotive tail-light lenses, optical instruments, and aircraft windows. Its
limitation when compared with glass is a much lower scratch resistance. Other uses of PMMA
include floor waxes and emulsion latex paints. Another important use of acrylics is in fibers
for textiles; polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is an example that goes by the more familiar trade names
Orlon (DuPont) and Acrilan (Monsanto).
Acrylonitrile–Butadiene–Styrene ABS is called an engineering plastic due to its excellent
combination of mechanical properties, some of which are listed in Table 8.3(c). ABS is a twophase terpolymer, one phase being the hard copolymer styrene–acrylonitrile, while the other
phase is styrene-butadiene copolymer that is rubbery. The name of the plastic is derived from
the three starting monomers, which may be mixed in various proportions. Typical applications
include components for automotive, appliances, business machines; and pipes and fittings.
Cellulosics Cellulose (C6H10O5) is a carbohydrate polymer commonly occurring in nature.
Wood and cotton fibers, the chief industrial sources of cellulose, contain about 50% and 95%

of the polymer, respectively. When cellulose is dissolved and reprecipitated during chemical
processing, the resulting polymer is called regenerated cellulose. When this is produced as a
fiber for apparel it is known as rayon (of course, cotton itself is a widely used fiber for apparel).
When it is produced as a thin film, it is cellophane, a common packaging material. Cellulose
itself cannot be used as a thermoplastic because it decomposes before melting when its
temperature is increased. However, it can be combined with various compounds to form
several plastics of commercial importance; examples are cellulose acetate (CA) and cellulose
acetate–butyrate (CAB). CA, data for which are given in Table 8.3(d), is produced in the form
of sheets (for wrapping), film (for photography), and molded parts. CAB is a better molding
material than CA and has greater impact strength, lower moisture absorption, and better
compatibility with plasticizers. The cellulosic thermoplastics share about 1% of the market.
Fluoropolymers Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE), commonly known as Teflon, accounts
for about 85% of the family of polymers called fluoropolymers, in which F atoms replace H
atoms in the hydrocarbon chain. PTFE is extremely resistant to chemical and environmental
attack, is unaffected by water, good heat resistance, and very low coefficient of friction. These
latter two properties have promoted its use in nonstick household cookware. Other
applications that rely on the same property include nonlubricating bearings and similar
components. PTFE also finds applications in chemical equipment and food processing.
Polyamides An important polymer family that forms characteristic amide linkages (CONH) during polymerization is the polyamides (PA). The most important members of the PA
familyarenylons, ofwhichthetwoprincipal grades arenylon-6and nylon-6,6(the numbers are
codes thatindicatethenumberofcarbonatoms inthemonomer).Thedatagivenin Table8.3(f)
are for nylon-6,6, which was developed at DuPont in the 1930s. Properties of nylon-6,
developed in Germany are similar. Nylon is strong, highly elastic, tough, abrasion resistant,
and self-lubricating. It retains good mechanical properties at temperatures up to about 125 C
(257 F). One shortcoming is that it absorbs water with an accompanying degradation in
properties. The majority of applications of nylon (about 90%) are in fibers for carpets, apparel,
and tire cord. The remainder (10%) are in engineering components; nylon is commonly a good
substitute for metals in bearings, gears, and similar parts where strength and low friction are
needed.
A second group of polyamides is the aramids (aromatic polyamides) of which Kevlar
(DuPont trade name) is gaining in importance as a fiber in reinforced plastics. The reason
for the interest in Kevlar is that its strength is the same as steel at 20% of the weight.

Polycarbonate Polycarbonate (PC) is noted for its generally excellent mechanical properties, which include high toughness and good creep resistance. It is one of the best
thermoplastics for heat resistance—it can be used to temperatures around 125 C (257 F).
In addition, it is transparent and fire resistant. Applications include molded machinery parts,
housings for business machines, pump impellers, safety helmets, and compact disks (e.g.,
audio, video, and computer). It is also widely used in glazing (window and windshield)
applications.
Polyesters The polyesters form a family of polymers made up of the characteristic
ester linkages (CO–O). They can be either thermoplastic or thermosetting, depending
on whether cross-linking occurs. Of the thermoplastic polyesters, a representative
example is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), data for which are compiled in the
table. It can be either amorphous or partially crystallized (up to about 30%),
depending on how it is cooled after shaping. Fast cooling favors the amorphous
state, which is highly transparent. Significant applications include blow-molded
beverage containers, photographic films, and magnetic recording tape. In addition,
PET fibers are widely used in apparel. Polyester fibers have low moisture absorption
and good deformation recovery, both of which make them ideal for ‘‘wash and wear’’
garments that resist wrinkling. The PET fibers are almost always blended with cotton
or wool. Familiar trade names for polyester fibers include Dacron (DuPont), Fortrel
(Celanese), and Kodel (Eastman Kodak).
Polyethylene Polyethylene (PE) was first synthesized in the 1930s, and today it accounts
for the largest volume of all plastics. The features that make PE attractive as an engineering
material are low cost, chemical inertness, and easy processing. Polyethylene is available in

several grades, the most common of which are low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and highdensity polyethylene (HDPE). The low-density grade is a highly branched polymer with lower
crystallinity and density. Applications include squeezable bottles, frozen food bags, sheets,
film, and wire insulation. HDPE has a more linear structure, with higher crystallinity and
density. These differences make HDPE stiffer and stronger and give it a higher melting
temperature. HDPE is used to produce bottles, pipes, and housewares. Both grades can be
processed by most polymer shaping methods (Chapter 13). Properties for the two grades are
given in Table 8.3(i).
Polypropylene Polypropylene (PP) has become a major plastic, especially for injection
molding, since its introduction in the late 1950s. PP can be synthesized in isotactic,
syndiotactic, or atactic structures, the first of these being the most important and for
which the characteristics are given in the table. It is the lightest of the plastics, and its
strength-to-weight ratio is high. PP is frequently compared with HDPE because its cost and
many of its properties are similar. However, the high melting point of polypropylene allows
certain applications that preclude use of polyethylene—for example, components that must
be sterilized. Other applications are injection molded parts for automotive and houseware,
and fiber products for carpeting. A special application suited to polypropylene is one-piece
hinges that can be subjected to a high number of flexing cycles without failure.
Polystyrene There are several polymers, copolymers, and terpolymers based on the
monomer styrene (C8H8), of which polystyrene (PS) is used in the highest volume. It is a
linear homopolymer with amorphous structure that is generally noted for its brittleness. PS is
transparent, easily colored, and readily molded, but degrades at elevated temperatures and
dissolves in various solvents. Because of its brittleness, some PS grades contain 5% to 15%
rubber and the term high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is used for these types. They have
higher toughness, but transparency and tensile strength are reduced. In addition to injection
molding applications (e.g., molded toys, housewares), polystyrene also finds uses in packaging
in the form of PS foams.

Polyvinylchloride Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic whose properties can
be varied by combining additives with the polymer. In particular, plasticizers are used to
achieve thermoplastics ranging from rigid PVC (no plasticizers) to flexible PVC (high
proportions of plasticizer). The range of properties makes PVC a versatile polymer, with
applications that include rigid pipe (used in construction, water and sewer systems, irrigation),
fittings, wire and cable insulation, film, sheets, food packaging, flooring, and toys. PVC by itself
is relatively unstable to heat and light, and stabilizers must be added to improve its resistance to
these environmental conditions. Care must be taken in the production and handling of the
vinyl chloride monomer used to polymerize PVC, due to its carcinogenic nature.

8.3

THERMOSETTING POLYMERS
Thermosetting (TS) polymers are distinguished by their highly cross-linked structure. In
effect, the formed part (e.g., the pot handle or electrical switch cover) becomes one large
macromolecule. Thermosets are always amorphous and exhibit no glass transition temperature. In this section, we examine the general characteristics of the TS plastics and
identify the important materials in this category.

8.3.1 GENERAL PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS
Owing to differences in chemistry and molecular structure, properties of thermosetting
plastics are different from those of thermoplastics. In general, thermosets are (1) more
rigid—modulus of elasticity is 2 to 3 times greater; (2) brittle—they possess virtually no
ductility; (3) less soluble in common solvents; (4) capable of higher service temperatures;
and (5) not capable of being remelted—instead they degrade or burn.
The differences in properties of the TS plastics are attributable to cross-linking,
which forms a thermally stable, three-dimensional, covalently bonded structure within
the molecule. Cross-linking is accomplished in three ways [7]:
1. Temperature-activated systems—In the most common systems, the changes are
caused by heat supplied during the part-shaping operation (e.g., molding). The starting

E1C08

Chapter 8/Polymers

material is a linear polymer in granular form supplied by the chemical plant. As heat is
added, the material softens for molding; continued heating results in cross-linking of
the polymer. The term thermosetting is most aptly applied to these polymers.
2. Catalyst-activated systems—Cross-linking in these systems occurs when small amounts
of a catalyst are added to the polymer, which is in liquid form. Without the catalyst, the
polymer remains stable; once combined with the catalyst, it changes into solid form.
3. Mixing-activated systems—Most epoxies are examples of these systems. The mixing
of two chemicals results in a reaction that forms a cross-linked solid polymer. Elevated
temperatures are sometimes used to accelerate the reactions.
The chemical reactions associated with cross-linking are called curing or setting. Curing is
done at the fabrication plants that shape the parts rather than the chemical plants that
supply the starting materials to the fabricator.

8.3.2 IMPORTANT THERMOSETTING POLYMERS
Thermosetting plastics are not as widely used as the thermoplastics, perhaps because of the
added processing complications involved in curing the TS polymers. The largest volume
thermosets are phenolic resins, whose annual volume is about 6% of the total plastics market.
This is significantly less than polyethylene, the leading thermoplastic, whose volume is about
35% of the total. Technical data for these materials are given in Table 8.4. Market share data
refer to total plastics (TP plus TS).
Amino Resins Amino plastics, characterized by the amino group (NH2), consist of two
thermosetting polymers, urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde, which are produced by the reaction of formaldehyde (CH2O) with either urea (CO(NH2)2) or melamine
(C3H6N6), respectively. In commercial importance, the amino resins rank just below the other
formaldehyde resin, phenol-formaldehyde, discussed below. Urea–formaldehyde is competitive with the phenols in certain applications, particularly as a plywood and particle-board
adhesive. The resins are also used as a molding compound. It is slightly more expensive than
the phenol material. Melamine–formaldehyde plastic is water resistant and is used for
dishware and as a coating in laminated table and counter tops (Formica, trade name of
Cyanamid Co.). When used as molding materials, amino plastics usually contain significant
proportions of fillers, such as cellulose.
Epoxies Epoxy resins are based on a chemical group called the epoxides. The simplest
formulation of epoxide is ethylene oxide (C2H3O). Epichlorohydrin (C3H5OCl) is a much
more widely used epoxide for producing epoxy resins. Uncured, epoxides have a low degree
of polymerization. To increase molecular weight and to cross-link the epoxide, a curing agent

must be used. Possible curing agents include polyamines and acid anhydrides. Cured epoxies
are noted for strength, adhesion, and heat and chemical resistance. Applications include
surface coatings, industrial flooring, glass fiber-reinforced composites, and adhesives. Insulating properties of epoxy thermosets make them useful in various electronic applications,
such as encapsulation of integrated circuits and lamination of printed circuit boards.
Phenolics Phenol (C6H5OH) is an acidic compound that can be reacted with aldehydes
(dehydrogenated alcohols), formaldehyde (CH2O) being the most reactive. Phenolformaldehyde is the most important of the phenolic polymers; it was first commercialized
around 1900 under the trade name Bakelite. It is almost always combined with fillers such
as wood flour, cellulose fibers, and minerals when used as a molding material. It is brittle,
possesses good thermal, chemical, and dimensional stability. Its capacity to accept colorants
is limited—it is available only in dark colors. Molded products constitute only about 10% of
total phenolics use. Other applications include adhesives for plywood, printed circuit
boards, counter tops, and bonding material for brake linings and abrasive wheels.
Polyesters Polyesters, which contain the characteristic ester linkages (CO–O), can be
thermosetting as well as thermoplastic (Section 8.2). Thermosetting polyesters are used
largely in reinforced plastics (composites) to fabricate large items such as pipes, tanks, boat
hulls, auto body parts, and construction panels. They can also be used in various molding
processes to produce smaller parts. Synthesis of the starting polymer involves reaction of an
acid or anhydride such as maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) with a glycol such as ethylene glycol
(C2H6O2). This produces an unsaturated polyester of relatively low molecular weight (MW ¼
1000 to 3000). This ingredient is mixed with a monomer capable of polymerizing and crosslinking with the polyester. Styrene (C8H8) is commonly used for this purpose, in proportions
of 30% to 50%. A third component, called an inhibitor, is added to prevent premature crosslinking. This mixture forms the polyester resin system that is supplied to the fabricator.
Polyesters are cured either by heat (temperature-activated systems), or by means of a catalyst

added to the polyester resin (catalyst-activated systems). Curing is done at the time of
fabrication (molding or other forming process) and results in cross-linking of the polymer.
An important class of polyesters are the alkyd resins (the name derived by abbreviating
and combining the words alcohol and acid and changing a few letters). They are used primarily
as bases for paints, varnishes, and lacquers. Alkyd molding compounds are also available, but
their applications are limited.
Polyimides These plastics are available as both thermoplastics and thermosets, but the
TS types are more important commercially. They are available under brand names such as
Kapton (Dupont) and Kaptrex (Professional Plastics) in several forms including tapes, films,
coatings, and molding resins. TS polyimides (PI) are noted for chemical resistance, high
tensile strength and stiffness, and stability at elevated temperatures. They are called hightemperature polymers due to their excellent heat resistance. Applications that exploit these
properties include insulating films, molded parts used in elevated temperature service,
flexible cables in laptop computers, medical tubing, and fibers for protective clothing.
Polyurethanes This includes a large family of polymers, all characterized by the urethane
group (NHCOO) in their structure. The chemistry of the polyurethanes is complex, and there
are many chemical varieties in the family. The characteristic feature is the reaction of a polyol,
whose molecules contain hydroxyl (OH) groups, such as butylene ether glycol (C4H10O2);
and an isocyanate, such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate (C15H10O2N2). Through variations
in chemistry, cross-linking, and processing, polyurethanes can be thermoplastic, thermosetting, or elastomeric materials, the latter two being the most important commercially. The
largest application of polyurethane is in foams. These can range between elastomeric and
rigid, the latter being more highly cross-linked. Rigid foams are used as a filler material in
hollow construction panels and refrigerator walls. In these types of applications, the material
provides excellent thermal insulation, adds rigidity to the structure, and does not absorb
water in significant amounts. Many paints, varnishes, and similar coating materials are based
on urethane systems. We discuss polyurethane elastomers in Section 8.4.
Silicones Silicones are inorganic and semi-inorganic polymers, distinguished by the
presence of the repeating siloxane link (–Si–O–) in their molecular structure. A typical
formulation combines the methyl radical (CH3) with (SiO) in various proportions to obtain

the repeating unit –((CH3)m–SiO)–, where m establishes the proportionality. By variations in
composition and processing, polysiloxanes can be produced in three forms: (1) fluids,
(2) elastomers, and (3) thermosetting resins. Fluids (1) are low molecular weight polymers
used for lubricants, polishes, waxes, and other liquids—not really polymers in the sense of this
chapter, but important commercial products nevertheless. Silicone elastomers (2), covered in
Section 8.4, and thermosetting silicones (3), treated here, are cross-linked. When highly crosslinked, polysiloxanes form rigid resin systems used for paints, varnishes, and other coatings;
and laminates such as printed circuit boards. They are also used as molding materials for
electrical parts. Curing is accomplished by heating or by allowing the solvents containing the
polymers to evaporate. Silicones are noted for their good heat resistance and water
repellence, but their mechanical strength is not as great as other cross-linked polymers.
Data in Table 8.4(g) are for a typical silicone thermosetting polymer.

8.4

ELASTOMERS
Elastomers are polymers capable of large elastic deformation when subjected to relatively
low stresses. Some elastomers can withstand extensions of 500% or more and still return to
their original shape. The more popular term for elastomer is, of course, rubber. We can
divide rubbers into two categories: (1) natural rubber, derived from certain biological
plants; and (2) synthetic elastomers, produced by polymerization processes similar to those
used for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Before discussing natural and synthetic rubbers, let us consider the general characteristics of elastomers.

8.4.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF ELASTOMERS
Elastomers consist of long-chain molecules that are cross-linked. They owe their impressive
elastic properties to the combination of two features: (1) the long molecules are tightly
kinked when unstretched, and (2) the degree of cross-linking is substantially below that of
the thermosets. These features are illustrated in the model of Figure 8.12(a), which shows a
tightly kinked cross-linked molecule under no stress.
When the material is stretched, the molecules are forced to uncoil and straighten as
shown in Figure 8.12(b). The molecules’ natural resistance to uncoiling provides the initial
elastic modulus of the aggregate material. As further strain is experienced, the covalent bonds

of the cross-linked molecules begin to play an increasing role in the modulus, and the stiffness
increases as illustrated in Figure 8.13. With greater cross-linking, the elastomer becomes stiffer
and its modulus of elasticity is more linear. These characteristics are shown in the figure by the
stress–strain curves for three grades of rubber: natural crude rubber, whose cross-linking is
very low; cured (vulcanized) rubber with low-to-medium cross-linking; and hard rubber
(ebonite), whose high degree of cross-linking transforms it into a thermosetting plastic.
For apolymer to exhibit elastomeric properties, it must beamorphous in theunstretched
condition, and its temperature must be above Tg. If below the glass transition temperature, the
material is hard and brittle; above Tg the polymer is in the ‘‘rubbery’’ state. Any amorphous
thermoplastic polymer will exhibit elastomeric properties above Tg for ashort time,becauseits
linear molecules are always coiled to some extent, thus allowing for elastic extension. It is the
absence of cross-linking in TP polymers that prevents them from being truly elastic; instead
they exhibit viscoelastic behavior.
Curing is required to effect cross-linking in most of the common elastomers today.
The term for curing used in the context of natural rubber (and certain synthetic rubbers) is
vulcanization, which involves the formation of chemical cross-links between the polymer
chains. Typical cross-linking in rubber is 1 to 10 links per 100 carbon atoms in the linear
polymer chain, depending on the degree of stiffness desired in the material. This is
considerably less than the degree of cross-linking in thermosets.
An alternative method of curing involves the use of starting chemicals that react when
mixed (sometimes requiring a catalyst or heat) to form elastomers with relatively infrequent
cross-links between molecules. These synthetic rubbers are known as reactive system
elastomers. Certain polymers that cure by this means, such as urethanes and silicones,
can be classified as either thermosets or elastomers, depending on the degree of cross-linking
achieved during the reaction.
A relatively new class of elastomers, called thermoplastic elastomers, possesses
elastomeric properties that result from the mixture of two phases, both thermoplastic.
One is above its Tg at room temperature while the other is below its Tg. Thus, we have a
polymer that includes soft rubbery regions intermixed with hard particles that act as crosslinks. The composite material is elastic in its mechanical behavior, although not as extensible
as most other elastomers. Because both phases are thermoplastic, the aggregate material can
be heated above its Tm for forming, using processes that are generally more economical than
those used for rubber.
We discuss the elastomers in the following two sections. The first deals with natural
rubber and how it is vulcanized to create a useful commercial material; the second examines
the synthetic rubbers.

8.4.2 NATURAL RUBBER
Natural rubber (NR) consists primarily of polyisoprene, a high-molecular-weight polymer of isoprene (C5H8). It is derived from latex, a milky substance produced by various
plants, the most important of which is the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) that grows in
tropical climates (Historical Note 8.2). Latex is a water emulsion of polyisoprene (about
one-third by weight), plus various other ingredients. Rubber is extracted from the latex
by various methods (e.g., coagulation, drying, and spraying) that remove the water.

Historical Note 8.2

T

Natural rubber

he first use of natural rubber seems to have been in the
form of rubber balls used for sport by the natives of
Central and South America at least 500 hundred years
ago. Columbus noted this during his second voyage to
the New World in 1493–1496. The balls were made from
the dried gum of a rubber tree. The first white men in
South America called the tree caoutchouc, which was
their way of pronouncing the Indian name for it. The
name rubber came from the English chemist Joseph
Priestley, who discovered (around 1770) that gum rubber
would ‘‘rub’’ away pencil marks.
Early rubber goods were less than satisfactory; they
melted in summer heat and hardened in winter cold.
One of those in the business of making and selling rubber
goods was American Charles Goodyear. Recognizing the
deficiencies of the natural material, he experimented
with ways to improve its properties and discovered that
rubber could be cured by heating it with sulfur. This was

in 1839, and the process, later called vulcanization, was
patented by him in 1844.
Vulcanization and the emerging demand for rubber
products led to tremendous growth in rubber production
and the industry that supported it. In 1876, Henry
Wickham collected thousands of rubber tree seeds from
the Brazilian jungle and planted them in England; the
sprouts were later transplanted to Ceylon and Malaya
(then British colonies) to form rubber plantations. Soon,
other countries in the region followed the British
example. Southeast Asia became the base of the rubber
industry.
In 1888, a British veterinary surgeon named John
Dunlop patented pneumatic tires for bicycles. By the
twentieth century, the motorcar industry was developing
in the United States and Europe. Together, the
automobile and rubber industries grew to occupy
positions of unimagined importance.

Natural crude rubber (without vulcanization) is sticky in hot weather, but stiff and
brittle in cold weather. To form an elastomer with useful properties, natural rubber must be
vulcanized. Traditionally, vulcanization has been accomplished by mixing small amounts of
sulfur and other chemicals with the crude rubber and heating. The chemical effect of
vulcanization is cross-linking; the mechanical result is increased strength and stiffness, yet
maintenance of extensibility. The dramatic change in properties caused by vulcanization can
be seen in the stress–strain curves of Figure 8.13.
Sulfur alone can cause cross-linking, but the process is slow, taking hours to complete.
Other chemicals are added to sulfur during vulcanization to accelerate the process and
serve other beneficial functions. Also, rubber can be vulcanized using chemicals other than
sulfur. Today, curing times have been reduced significantly compared to the original sulfur
curing of years ago.
As an engineering material, vulcanized rubber is noted among elastomers for its high
tensile strength, tear strength, resilience (capacity to recover shape after deformation), and
resistance to wear and fatigue. Its weaknesses are that it degrades when subjected to heat,
sunlight, oxygen, ozone, and oil. Some of these limitations can be reduced through the use
of additives. Typical properties and other data for vulcanized natural rubber are listed in
Table 8.5. Market share is relative to total annual rubber volume, natural plus synthetic.
Rubber volume is about 15% of total polymer market.

The largest single market for natural rubber is automotive tires. In tires, carbon black
is an important additive; it reinforces the rubber, serving to increase tensile strength and
resistance to tearing and abrasion. Other products made of rubber include shoe soles,
bushings, seals, and shock-absorbing components. In each case, the rubber is compounded
to achieve the specific properties required in the application. Besides carbon black, other
additives used in rubber and some of the synthetic elastomers include clay, kaolin, silica,
talc, and calcium carbonate, as well as chemicals that accelerate and promote vulcanization.

8.4.3 SYNTHETIC RUBBERS
Today, the tonnage of synthetic rubbers is more than three times that of natural rubber.
Development of these synthetic materials was motivated largely by the world wars when NR
was difficult to obtain (Historical Note 8.3). The most important of the synthetics is styrene–
butadiene rubber (SBR), a copolymer of butadiene (C4H6) and styrene (C8H8). As with most
other polymers, the predominant raw material for the synthetic rubbers is petroleum. Only
the synthetic rubbers of greatest commercial importance are discussed here. Technical data
are presented in Table 8.6. Market share data are for total volume of natural and synthetic

n 1826, Faraday recognized the formula of natural
rubber to be C5H8. Subsequent attempts at reproducing
this molecule over many years were generally
unsuccessful. Regrettably, it was the world wars that
created the necessity which became the mother of
invention for synthetic rubber. In World War I, the
Germans, denied access to natural rubber, developed a
methyl-based substitute. This material was not very
successful, but it marks the first large-scale production of
synthetic rubber.
After World War I, the price of natural rubber was so
low that many attempts at fabricating synthetics were
abandoned. However, the Germans, perhaps
anticipating a future conflict, renewed their development
efforts. The firm I.G. Farben developed two synthetic
rubbers, starting in the early 1930s, called Buna-S and
Buna-N. Buna is derived from butadiene (C4H6), which
has become the critical ingredient in many modern
synthetic rubbers, and Na, the symbol for sodium, used
to accelerate or catalyze the polymerization process

(Natrium is the German word for sodium). The symbol
S in Buna-S stands for styrene. Buna-S is the copolymer
we know today as styrene–butadiene rubber, or SBR.
The N in Buna-N stands for acryloNitrile, and the
synthetic rubber is called nitrile rubber in current usage.
Other efforts included the work at the DuPont
Company in the United States, which led to the development of polychloroprene, first marketed in 1932 under
the name Duprene, later changed to Neoprene, its
current name.
During World War II, the Japanese cut off the supply
of natural rubber from Southeast Asia to the United
States. Production of Buna-S synthetic rubber was begun
on a large scale in America. The federal government
preferred to use the name GR-S (Government RubberStyrene) rather than Buna-S (the German name). By
1944, the United States was outproducing Germany
in SBR 10-to-1. Since the early 1960s, worldwide
production of synthetic rubbers has exceeded that of
natural rubbers.

rubbers. About 10% of total volume of rubber production is reclaimed; thus, total tonnages in
Tables 8.5 and 8.6 do not sum to 100%.
Butadiene Rubber Polybutadiene (BR) is important mainly in combination with other
rubbers. It is compounded with natural rubber and with styrene (styrene–butadiene rubber
is discussed later) in the production of automotive tires. Without compounding, the tear
resistance, tensile strength, and ease of processing of polybutadiene are less than desirable.
Butyl Rubber Butyl rubber is a copolymer of polyisobutylene (98%–99%) and polyisoprene (1%–2%). It can be vulcanized to provide a rubber with very low air permeability,
which has led to applications in inflatable products such as inner tubes, liners in tubeless
tires, and sporting goods.
Chloroprene Rubber Polychloroprene was one of the first synthetic rubbers to be
developed (early 1930s). Commonly known today as Neoprene, it is an important specialpurpose rubber. It crystallizes when strained to provide good mechanical properties. Chloroprene rubber (CR) is more resistant to oils, weather, ozone, heat, and flame (chlorine makes
this rubber self-extinguishing) than NR, but somewhat more expensive. Its applications
include fuel hoses (and other automotive parts), conveyor belts, and gaskets, but not tires.
Ethylene–Propylene Rubber Polymerization of ethylene and propylene with small
proportions (3%–8%) of a diene monomer produces the terpolymer ethylene–propylene–diene (EPDM), a useful synthetic rubber. Applications are for parts mostly in the
automotive industry other than tires. Other uses are wire and cable insulation.

Isoprene Rubber Isoprene can be polymerized to synthesize a chemical equivalent of
natural rubber. Synthetic (unvulcanized) polyisoprene is softer and more easily molded than
raw natural rubber. Applications of the synthetic material are similar to those of its natural
counterpart, car tires being the largest single market. It is also used for footwear, conveyor
belts, and caulking compound. Cost per unit weight is about 35% higher than for NR.
Nitrile Rubber This is a vulcanizable copolymer of butadiene (50%–75%) and acrylonitrile (25%–50%). Its more technical name is butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber. It has good
strength and resistance to abrasion, oil, gasoline, and water. These properties make it ideal
for applications such as gasoline hoses and seals, and also for footwear.
Polyurethanes Thermosetting polyurethanes (Section 8.3.2) with minimum cross-linking are elastomers, most commonly produced as flexible foams. In this form, they are widely
used as cushion materials for furniture and automobile seats. Unfoamed polyurethane can

be molded into products ranging from shoe soles to car bumpers, with cross-linking
adjusted to achieve the desired properties for the application. With no cross-linking,
the material is a thermoplastic elastomer that can be injection molded. As an elastomer or
thermoset, reaction injection molding and other shaping methods are used.
Silicones Like the polyurethanes, silicones can be elastomeric or thermosetting,
depending on the degree of cross-linking. Silicone elastomers are noted for the wide
temperature range over which they can be used. Their resistance to oils is poor. The
silicones possess various chemistries, the most common being polydimethylsiloxane
(Table 8.6(h)). To obtain acceptable mechanical properties, silicone elastomers must be
reinforced, usually with fine silica powders. Owing to their high cost, they are considered
special-purpose rubbers for applications such as gaskets, seals, wire and cable insulation,
prosthetic devices, and bases for caulking materials.
Styrene–Butadiene Rubber SBR is a random copolymer of styrene (about 25%) and
butadiene (about 75%). It was originally developed in Germany as Buna-S rubber before
World War II. Today, it is the largest tonnage elastomer, totaling about 40% of all rubbers
produced (natural rubber is second in tonnage). Its attractive features are low cost,
resistance to abrasion, and better uniformity than NR. When reinforced with carbon
black and vulcanized, its characteristics and applications are very similar to those of
natural rubber. Cost is also similar. A close comparison of properties reveals that most of
its mechanical properties except wear resistance are inferior to NR, but its resistance to
heat aging, ozone, weather, and oils is superior. Applications include automotive tires,
footwear, and wire and cable insulation. A material chemically related to SBR is styrene–
butadiene–styrene block copolymer, a thermoplastic elastomer discussed below.
Thermoplastic Elastomers As previously described, a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE)
is a thermoplastic that behaves like an elastomer. It constitutes a family of polymers that
is a fast-growing segment of the elastomer market. TPEs derive their elastomeric
properties not from chemical cross-links, but from physical connections between soft
and hard phases that make up the material. Thermoplastic elastomers include styrene–
butadiene–styrene (SBS), a block copolymer as opposed to styrene–butadiene rubber
(SBR) which is a random copolymer (Section 8.1.2); thermoplastic polyurethanes;

thermoplastic polyester copolymers; and other copolymers and polymer blends. Table 8.6
(j) gives data on SBS. The chemistry and structure of these materials are generally
complex, involving two materials that are incompatible so that they form distinct phases
whose room temperature properties are different. Owing to their thermoplasticity, the
TPEs cannot match conventional cross-linked elastomers in elevated temperature
strength and creep resistance. Typical applications include footwear, rubber bands,
extruded tubing, wire coating, and molded parts for automotive and other uses in which
elastomeric properties are required. TPEs are not suitable for tires.

8.5

POLYMER RECYCLING AND BIODEGRADABILITY
It is estimated that since the 1950s, 1 billion tons of plastic have been discarded as
garbage.2 This plastic trash could be around for centuries, because the primary bonds that
make plastics so durable also make them resistant to degradation by the environmental
and biological processes of nature. In this section, we consider two polymer topics related
to environmental concerns: (1) recycling of polymer products and (2) biodegradable
plastics.

8.5.1 POLYMER RECYCLING
Approximately 200 million tons of plastic products are made annually throughout the
world, more than one-eighth of which are produced in the United States.3 Only about 6%
of the U.S. tonnage is recycled as plastic waste; the rest either remains in products and/or
ends up in garbage landfills. Recycling means recovering the discarded plastic items and
reprocessing them into new products, in some cases products that are quite different from
the original discarded items.
In general the recycling of plastics is more difficult that recycling of glass and metal
products. There are several reasons for this: (1) compared to plastic parts, many recycled
metal items are much larger and heavier (e.g., structural steel from buildings and bridges,
steel car body frames), so the economics of recycling are more favorable for recycling
metals; most plastic items are lightweight; (2) compared to plastics, which come in a
variety of chemical compositions that do not mix well, glass products are all based on
silicon dioxide; and (3) many plastic products contain fillers, dyes, and other additives
that cannot be readily separated from the polymer itself. Of course, a common problem in
all recycling efforts is the fluctuation in prices of recycled materials.
To cope with the problem of mixing different types of plastics and to promote
recycling of plastics, the Plastic Identification Code (PIC) was developed by the Society
2

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic.
According to the Society of Plastics Engineers, as reported in en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_
plastic.

of the Plastics Industry. The code is a symbol consisting of a triangle formed by three bent
arrows enclosing a number. It is printed or molded on the plastic item. The number
identifies the plastic for recycling purposes. The seven plastics (all thermoplastics) used in
the PIC recycling program are (1) polyethylene terephthalate, used in 2-liter beverage
containers; (2) high-density polyethylene, used in milk jugs and shopping bags; (3)
polyvinyl chloride, used in juice bottles and PVC pipes; (4) low-density polyethylene,
used in squeezable bottles and flexible container lids; (5) polypropylene, used in yogurt
and margarine containers; (6) polystyrene, used in egg cartons, disposable plates, cups,
and utensils, and as foamed packing materials; and (7) other, such as polycarbonate or
ABS. The PIC facilitates the separation of items made from the different types of plastics
for reprocessing. Nevertheless, sorting the plastics is a labor-intensive activity.
Once separated, the thermoplastic items can be readily reprocessed into new
products by remelting. This is not the case with thermosets and rubbers because of
the cross-linking in these polymers. Thus, these materials must be recycled and
reprocessed by different means. Recycled thermosets are typically ground up into
particulate matter and used as fillers, for example, in molded plastic parts. Most
recycled rubber comes from used tires. While some of these tires are retreaded,
others are ground up into granules in forms such as chunks and nuggets that can be
used for landscape mulch, playgrounds, and similar purposes.

8.5.2 BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS
Another approach that addresses the environmental concerns about plastics involves
the development of biodegradable plastics, which are defined as plastics that are
decomposed by the actions of microorganisms occurring in nature, such as bacteria and
fungi. Conventional plastic products usually consist of a combination of a petroleumbased polymer and a filler (Section 8.1.5). In effect, the material is a polymer-matrix
composite (Section 9.4). The purpose of the filler is to improve mechanical properties
and/or reduce material cost. In many cases, neither the polymer nor the filler are
biodegradable. Distinguished from these non-biodegradable plastics are two forms of
biodegradable plastics: (1) partially degradable and (2) completely degradable.
Partially biodegradable plastics consist of a conventional polymer and a natural
filler. The polymer matrix is petroleum-based, which is non-biodegradable, but the
natural filler can be consumed by microorganisms (e.g., in a landfill), thus converting the
polymer into a sponge-like structure and possibly leading to its degradation over time.
The plastics of greatest interest from an environmental viewpoint are the completely
biodegradable plastics (aka bioplastics) consisting of a polymer and filler that are both
derived from natural and renewable sources. Various agricultural products are used as the
raw materials for biodegradable plastics. A common polymeric starting material is starch,
which is a major component in corn, wheat, rice, and potatoes. It consists of the two polymers
amylose and amylopectin. Starch can be used to synthesize several thermoplastic materials
that are processable by conventional plastic shaping methods, such as extrusion and injection
molding (Chapter 13). Another starting point for biodegradable plastics involves fermentation of either corn starch or sugar cane to produce lactic acid, which can be polymerized to
form polylactide, another thermoplastic material. A common filler used in bioplastics is
cellulose, often in the form of reinforcing fibers in the polymer-matrix composite. Cellulose is
grown as flax or hemp. It is inexpensive and possesses good mechanical strength.
Applications of biodegradable plastics are inhibited by the fact that these
materials are more expensive than petroleum-based polymers. That may change in
the future due to technological advances and economies of scale. Biopolymers are
most attractive in situations where degradability is a higher priority than cost savings.
At the top of the list are packaging materials that are quickly discarded as waste in

landfills. It is estimated that approximately 40% of all plastics are used in packaging,
mostly for food products [12]. Thus, biodegradable plastics are being used increasingly as substitutes for conventional plastics in packaging applications. Other applications include disposable food service items, coatings for paper and cardboard,
waste bags, and mulches for agricultural crops. Medical applications include sutures,
catheter bags, and sanitary laundry bags in hospitals.

8.6

GUIDE TO THE PROCESSING OF POLYMERS
Polymers are nearly always shaped in a heated, highly plastic consistency. Common
operations are extrusion and molding. The molding of thermosets is generally more
complicated because they require curing (cross-linking). Thermoplastics are easier to
mold, and a greater variety of molding operations are available to process them
(Chapter 13). Although plastics readily lend themselves to net shape processing,
machining is sometimes required (Chapter 22); and plastic parts can be assembled
into products by permanent joining techniques such as welding (Chapter 29), adhesive
bonding (Section 31.3), or mechanical assembly (Chapter 32).
Rubber processing has a longer history than plastics, and the industries associated
with these polymer materials have traditionally been separated, even though their
processing is similar in many ways. We cover rubber processing technology in Chapter 14.

In addition to metals, ceramics, and polymers, a fourth
material category can be distinguished: composites. A composite material is a material system composed of two or
more physically distinct phases whose combination produces
aggregate properties that are different from those of its
constituents. In certain respects, composites are the most
interesting of the engineering materials because their structure is more complex than the other three types.
The technological and commercial interest in composite materials derives from the fact that their properties are
not just different from their components but are often far
superior. Some of the possibilities include:
å Composites can be designed that are very strong and
stiff, yet very light in weight, giving them strengthto-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios several
times greater than steel or aluminum. These properties are highly desirable in applications ranging
from commercial aircraft to sports equipment.
å Fatigue properties are generally better than for the
common engineering metals. Toughness is often
greater, too.
å Composites can be designed that do not corrode like
steel; this is important in automotive and other
applications.
å With composite materials, it is possible to achieve
combinations of properties not attainable with metals, ceramics, or polymers alone.
å Better appearance and control of surface smoothness
are possible with certain composite materials.
Along with the advantages, there are disadvantages and
limitations associated with composite materials. These include: (1) properties of many important composites are anisotropic, which means the properties differ depending on the
direction in which they are measured; (2) many of the polymer-based composites are subject to attack by chemicals or

solvents, just as the polymers themselves are susceptible to attack; (3) composite materials are
generally expensive, although prices may drop as volume increases; and (4) certain of the
manufacturing methods for shaping composite materials are slow and costly.
We have already encountered several composite materials in our coverage of the
three other material types. Examples include cemented carbides (tungsten carbide with
cobalt binder), plastic molding compounds that contain fillers (e.g., cellulose fibers, wood
flour), and rubber mixed with carbon black. We did not always identify these materials as
composites; however, technically, they fit the above definition. It could even be argued
that a two-phase metal alloy (e.g., Fe þ Fe3C) is a composite material, although it is not
classified as such. Perhaps the most important composite material of all is wood.
In our presentation of composite materials, we first examine their technology and
classification. There are many different materials and structures that can be used to form
composites; we survey the various categories, devoting the most time to fiber-reinforced
plastics, which are commercially the most important type. In the final section, we provide
a guide to the manufacturing processes for composites.

9.1

TECHNOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION OF COMPOSITE
MATERIALS
As noted in our definition, a composite material consists of two or more distinct phases. The
term phase indicates a homogeneous material, such as a metal or ceramic in which all of the
grains have the same crystal structure, or a polymer with no fillers. By combining the phases,
using methods yet to be described, a new material is created with aggregate performance
exceeding that of its parts. The effect is synergistic.
Composite materials can be classified in various ways. One possible classification
distinguishes between (1) traditional and (2) synthetic composites. Traditional composites
are those that occur in nature or have been produced by civilizations for many years. Wood
is a naturally occurring composite material, while concrete (Portland cement plus sand or
gravel) and asphalt mixed with gravel are traditional composites used in construction.
Synthetic composites are modern material systems normally associated with the manufacturing industries, in which the components are first produced separately and then
combined in a controlled way to achieve the desired structure, properties, and part
geometry. These synthetic materials are the composites normally thought of in the context
of engineered products. Our attention in this chapter is focused on these materials.

9.1.1 COMPONENTS IN A COMPOSITE MATERIAL
In the simplest manifestation of our definition, a composite material consists of two phases:
a primary phase and a secondary phase. The primary phase forms the matrix within which
the secondary phase is imbedded. The imbedded phase is sometimes referred to as a
reinforcing agent (or similar term), because it usually serves to strengthen the composite.
The reinforcing phase may be in the form of fibers, particles, or various other geometries, as
we shall see. The phases are generally insoluble in each other, but strong adhesion must
exist at their interface(s).
The matrix phase can be any of three basic material types: polymers, metals, or
ceramics. The secondary phase may also be one of the three basic materials, or it may be an
element such as carbon or boron. Possible combinations in a two-component composite
material can be organized as a 3  4 chart, as in Table 9.1. We see that certain combinations
are not feasible, such as a polymer in a ceramic matrix. We also see that the possibilities

include two-phase structures consisting of components of the same material type, such as
fibers of Kevlar (polymer) in a plastic (polymer) matrix. In other composites the imbedded
material is an element such as carbon or boron.
The classification system for composite materials used in this book is based on the
matrix phase. We list the classes here and discuss them in Sections 9.2 through 9.4:
1. Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) include mixtures of ceramics and metals, such as
cemented carbides and other cermets, as well as aluminum or magnesium reinforced
by strong, high stiffness fibers.
2. Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) are the least common category. Aluminum
oxide and silicon carbide are materials that can be imbedded with fibers for improved
properties, especially in high temperature applications.
3. Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs). Thermosetting resins are the most widely used
polymers in PMCs. Epoxy and polyester are commonly mixed with fiber reinforcement, and phenolic is mixed with powders. Thermoplastic molding compounds
are often reinforced, usually with powders (Section 8.1.5).
The classification can be applied to traditional composites as well as synthetics.Concrete
is a ceramic matrix composite, while asphalt and wood are polymer matrix composites.
The matrix material serves several functions in the composite. First, it provides the
bulk form of the part or product made of the composite material. Second, it holds the
imbedded phase in place, usually enclosing and often concealing it. Third, when a load is
applied, the matrix shares the load with the secondary phase, in some cases deforming so
that the stress is essentially born by the reinforcing agent.

9.1.2 THE REINFORCING PHASE
It is important to understand that the role played by the secondary phase is to reinforce
the primary phase. The imbedded phase is most commonly one of the shapes illustrated in
Figure 9.1: fibers, particles, or flakes. In addition, the secondary phase can take the form
of an infiltrated phase in a skeletal or porous matrix.
Fibers Fibers are filaments of reinforcing material, generally circular in cross-section,
although alternative shapes are sometimes used (e.g., tubular, rectangular, hexagonal).

Diameters range from less than 0.0025 mm (0.0001 in) to about 0.13 mm (0.005 in),
depending on material.
Fiber reinforcement provides the greatest opportunity for strength enhancement of
composite structures. In fiber-reinforced composites, the fiber is often considered to be the
principal constituent since it bears the major share of the load. Fibers are of interest as
reinforcing agents because the filament form of most materials is significantly stronger than
the bulk form. The effect of fiber diameter on tensile strength can be seen in Figure 9.2. As
diameter is reduced, the material becomes oriented in the direction of the fiber axis and the
probability of defects in the structure decreases significantly. As a result, tensile strength
increases dramatically.
Fibers used in composites can be either continuous or discontinuous. Continuous fibers
are very long; in theory, they offer a continuous path by which a load can be carried by the
composite part. In reality, this is difficult to achieve due to variations in the fibrous material
and processing. Discontinuous fibers (chopped sections of continuous fibers) are short
lengths (L/D  100). An important type of discontinuous fiber are whiskers—hair-like single
crystals with diameters down to about 0.001 mm (0.00004 in) and very high strength.
Fiber orientation is another factor in composite parts. We can distinguish three
cases, illustrated in Figure 9.3: (a) one-dimensional reinforcement, in which maximum
strength and stiffness are obtained in the direction of the fiber; (b) planar reinforcement,

in some cases in the form of a two-dimensional woven fabric; and (c) random or threedimensional in which the composite material tends to possess isotropic properties.
Various materials are used as fibers in fiber-reinforced composites: metals, ceramics,
polymers, carbon, and boron. The most important commercial use of fibers is in polymer
composites. However, use of fiber-reinforced metals and ceramics is growing. Following is a
survey of the important types of fiber materials, with properties listed in Table 9.2:
å Glass—The most widely used fiber in polymers, the term fiberglass is applied to
denote glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP). The two common glass fibers are Eglass and S-glass (compositions listed in Table 7.4). E-glass is strong and low cost, but
its modulus is less than other fibers. S-glass is stiffer, and its tensile strength is one of
the highest of all fiber materials; however, it is more expensive than E-glass.
å Carbon—Carbon (Section 7.5.1) can be made into high-modulus fibers. Besides
stiffness, other attractive properties include low-density and low-thermal expansion.
C-fibers are generally a combination of graphite and amorphous carbon.
å Boron—Boron (Section 7.5.3) has a very high elastic modulus, but its high cost limits
applications to aerospace components in which this property (and others) are critical.
å Kevlar 49—This is the most important polymer fiber; it is a highly crystalline aramid,
a member of the polyamide family (Section 8.2.2). Its specific gravity is low, giving it
one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of all fibers.
å Ceramics—Silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) are the main fiber
materials among ceramics. Both have high elastic moduli and can be used to
strengthen low-density, low-modulus metals such as aluminum and magnesium.
å Metal—Steel filaments, both continuous and discontinuous, are used as reinforcing
fibers in plastics. Other metals are currently less common as reinforcing fibers.
Particles and Flakes A second common shape of the imbedded phase is particulate,
ranging in size from microscopic to macroscopic. Particles are an important material form
for metals and ceramics; we discuss the characterization and production of engineering
powders in Chapters 16 and 17.
The distribution of particles in the composite matrix is random, and therefore strength
and other properties of the composite material are usually isotropic. The strengthening
mechanism depends on particle size. The microscopic size is represented by very fine powders

E1C09

11/11/2009

14:30:31

Page 192

Chapter 9/Composite Materials

(around 1 mm) distributed in the matrix in concentrations of 15% or less. The presence of
these powders results in dispersion-hardening of the matrix, in which dislocation movement
in the matrix material is restricted by the microscopic particles. In effect, the matrix itself is
strengthened, and no significant portion of the applied load is carried by the particles.
As particle size increases to the macroscopic range, and the proportion of imbedded
material increases to 25% and more, the strengthening mechanism changes. In this case, the
applied load is shared between the matrix and the imbedded phase. Strengthening occurs
due to the load-carrying ability of the particles and the bonding of particles in the matrix.
This form of composite strengthening occurs in cemented carbides, in which tungsten
carbide is held in a cobalt binder. The proportion of tungsten carbide (WC) in the cobalt
(Co) matrix is typically 80% or more.
Flakes are basically two-dimensional particles—small flat platelets. Two examples of
this shape are the minerals mica (silicate of K and Al) and talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2), used as
reinforcing agents in plastics. They are generally lower cost materials than polymers, and
they add strength and stiffness to plastic molding compounds. Platelet sizes are usually in
the range 0.01– to 1 mm (0.0004–0.040 in) across the flake, with a thickness of 0.001– to 0.005
mm (0.00004–0.00020 in).
Infiltrated Phase The fourth form of imbedded phase occurs when the matrix has the
form of a porous skeleton (like a sponge), and the second phase is simply a filler. In this case,
the imbedded phase assumes the shape of the pores in the matrix. Metallic fillers are
sometimes used to infiltrate the open porous structure of parts made by powder metallurgy
techniques (Section 16.3.4), in effect creating a composite material. Oil-impregnated
sintered PM components, such as bearings and gears, might be considered another example
of this category.
The Interface There is always an interface between constituent phases in a composite
material. For the composite to operate effectively, the phases must bond where they join. In
some cases, there is a direct bonding between the two ingredients, as suggested by Figure 9.4

FIGURE 9.4 Interfaces and interphases between phases in a composite material: (a) direct bonding between
primary and secondary phases; (b) addition of a third ingredient to bond the primary and secondary phases
and form an interphase; and (c) formation of an interphase by solution of the primary and secondary phases at
their boundary.

(a). In other cases, a third ingredient is added to promote bonding of the two primary
phases. Called an interphase, this third ingredient can be thought of as an adhesive. An
important example is the coating of glass fibers to achieve adhesion with thermosetting
resin in fiberglass-reinforced plastics. As illustrated in Figure 9.4(b), this case results in
two interfaces, one on either boundary of the interphase. Finally, a third form of interface
occurs when the two primary components are not completely insoluble in each other; in
this case, the interphase is formed consisting of a solution of the phases, as in Figure 9.4(c).
An example occurs in cemented carbides (Section 9.2.1); at the high sintering temperatures
used on these materials, some solubility results at the boundaries to create an interphase.

9.1.3 PROPERTIES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS
In the selection of a composite material, an optimum combination of properties is usually
being sought, rather than one particular property. For example, the fuselage and wings of an
aircraft must be lightweight as well as strong, stiff, and tough. Finding a monolithic material
that satisfies these requirements is difficult. Several fiber-reinforced polymers possess this
combination of properties.
Another example is rubber. Natural rubber is a relatively weak material. In the early
1900s, it was discovered that by adding significant amounts of carbon black (almost pure
carbon) to natural rubber, its strength is increased dramatically. The two ingredients
interact to provide a composite material that is significantly stronger than either one alone.
Rubber, of course, must also be vulcanized to achieve full strength.
Rubber itself is a useful additive in polystyrene. One of the distinctive and
disadvantageous properties of polystyrene is its brittleness. Although most other polymers have considerable ductility, polystyrene has virtually none. Rubber (natural or
synthetic) can be added in modest amounts (5%–15%) to produce high-impact polystyrene, which has much superior toughness and impact strength.
Properties of a composite material are determined by three factors: (1) the
materials used as component phases in the composite, (2) the geometric shapes of
the constituents and resulting structure of the composite system, and (3) the manner in
which the phases interact with one another.
Rule of Mixtures The properties of a composite material are a function of the starting
materials. Certain properties of a composite material can be computed by means of a rule
of mixtures, which involves calculating a weighted average of the constituent material
properties. Density is an example of this averaging rule. The mass of a composite material
is the sum of the masses of the matrix and reinforcing phases:
mc ¼ mm þ mr

ð9:1Þ

where m ¼ mass, kg (lb); and the subscripts c, m, and r indicate composite, matrix, and
reinforcing phases, respectively. Similarly, the volume of the composite is the sum of its
constituents:
Vc ¼ Vm þ Vr þ Vv

ð9:2Þ

where V ¼ volume, cm3 (in3). Vv is the volume of any voids in the composite (e.g., pores).
The density of the composite is the mass divided by the volume.

Chapter 9/Composite Materials

Because the masses of the matrix and reinforcing phase are their respective densities
multiplied by their volumes,
mm ¼ rm V m

and

mr ¼ rr V r

we can substitute these terms into Eq. (9.3) and conclude that
rc ¼ f m rm þ f r rr

ð9:4Þ

where f m ¼ V m =V c and f r ¼ V r =V c are simply the volume fractions of the matrix and
reinforcing phases.
Fiber-Reinforced Composites Determining mechanical properties of composites from
constituent properties is usually more involved. The rule of mixtures can sometimes be used
to estimate the modulus of elasticity of a fiber-reinforced composite made of continuous
fibers where Ec is measured in the longitudinal direction. The situation is depicted in
Figure 9.5(a); we assume that the fiber material is much stiffer than the matrix and that
the bonding between the two phases is secure. Under this model, the modulus of the
composite can be predicted as follows:
Ec ¼ f m Em þ f r Er

ð9:5Þ

where Ec, Em, and Er are the elastic moduli of the composite and its constituents, MPa (lb/
in2); and fm and fr are again the volume fractions of the matrix and reinforcing phase. The
effect of Eq. (9.5) is seen in Figure 9.5(b).
Perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, the fibers contribute little to the overall
stiffness except for their filling effect. The composite modulus can be estimated in this

FIGURE 9.5

which elastic modulus is being estimated by the rule of mixtures. (b) Stress–strain
relationships for the composite material and its constituents. The fiber is stiff but brittle,
while the matrix (commonly a polymer) is soft but ductile. The composite’s modulus is a
weighted average of its components’ moduli. But when the reinforcing fibers fail, the
composite does likewise.

ð9:6Þ

where Ec0 ¼ elastic modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction, MPa (lb/in2). Our two
equations for Ec demonstrate the significant anisotropy of fiber-reinforced composites.
This directional effect can be seen in Figure 9.6 for a fiber-reinforced polymer composite, in
which both elastic modulus and tensile strength are measured relative to fiber direction.
Fibers illustrate the importance of geometric shape. Most materials have tensile
strengths several times greater in a fibrous form than in bulk. However, applications of
fibers are limited by surface flaws, buckling when subjected to compression, and the
inconvenience of the filament geometry when a solid component is needed. By imbedding
the fibers in a polymer matrix, a composite material is obtained that avoids the problems of
fibers but utilizes their strengths. The matrix provides the bulk shape to protect the fiber
surfaces and resist buckling; and the fibers lend their high strength to the composite. When a
load is applied, the low-strength matrix deforms and distributes the stress to the high-strength
fibers, which then carry the load. If individual fibers break, the load is redistributed through
the matrix to other fibers.

9.1.4 OTHER COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
Our model of a composite material described above is one in which a reinforcing phase is
imbedded in a matrix phase, the combination having properties that are superior in certain
respects to either of the constituents alone. However, composites can take alternative forms
that do not fit this model, some of which are of considerable commercial and technological
importance.
A laminar composite structure consists of two or more layers bonded together to form
an integral piece, as in Figure 9.7(a). The layers are usually thick enough that this composite
can be readily identified—not always the case with other composites. The layers are often of
different materials, but not necessarily. Plywood is such an example; the layers are of the
same wood, but the grains are oriented differently to increase overall strength of the
laminated piece. A laminar composite often uses different materials in its layers to gain the
advantage of combining the particular properties of each. In some cases, the layers
themselves may be composite materials. We have mentioned that wood is a composite
material; therefore, plywood is a laminar composite structure in which the layers themselves
are composite materials. A list of examples of laminar composites is compiled in Table 9.3.

Laminar Composite

Description (reference in text if applicable)

Automotive tires

A tire consists of multiple layers bonded together; the layers are composite materials
(rubber reinforced with carbon black), and the plies consist of rubber-impregnated
fabrics (Chapter 14).
A lightweight honeycomb structure is bonded on either face to thin sheets, as in
Figure 9.7(c).
Multilayered fiber-reinforced plastic panels are used for aircraft, automobile body
panels, and boat hulls (Chapter 15).
Alternating sheets of wood are bonded together at different orientations for improved
strength.
Layers of copper and reinforced plastic are used for electrical conductivity and
insulation, respectively (Section 36.2).
Skis are laminar composite structures consisting of multiple layers of metals, particle
board, and phenolic plastic.
Two layers of glass on either side of a sheet of tough plastic (Section 12.3.1).

The sandwich structure is sometimes distinguished as a special case of the laminar
composite structure. It consists of a relatively thick core of low-density material bonded on
both faces to thin sheets of a different material. The low-density core may be a foamed
material, as in Figure 9.7(b), or a honeycomb, as in (c). The reason for using a sandwich
structure is to obtain a material with high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios.

9.2

METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES
Metal matrix composites (MMCs) consist of a metal matrix reinforced by a second phase.
Common reinforcing phases include (1) particles of ceramic and (2) fibers of various
materials, including other metals, ceramics, carbon, and boron. MMCs of the first type are
commonly called cermets.

9.2.1 CERMETS
A cermet1 is a composite material in which a ceramic is contained in a metallic matrix.
The ceramic often dominates the mixture, sometimes ranging up to 96% by volume.
1

The word ‘‘cermet’’ was first used in the English language around 1948.

Bonding can be enhanced by slight solubility between phases at the elevated temperatures used in processing these composites. Cermets can be subdivided into (1) cemented
carbides and (2) oxide-based cermets.
Cemented Carbides Cemented carbides are composed of one or more carbide compounds bonded in a metallic matrix. The term cermet is not used for all of these materials,
even though it is technically correct. The common cemented carbides are based on tungsten
carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC), and chromium carbide (Cr3C2). Tantalum carbide
(TaC) and others are also used but less commonly. The principal metallic binders are cobalt
and nickel. We have previously discussed the carbide ceramics (Section 7.3.2); they constitute
the principal ingredient in cemented carbides, typically ranging in content from 80% to 95%
of total weight.
Cemented carbide parts are produced by particulate processing techniques (Section
17.3). Cobalt is the binder used for WC (see Figure 9.8), and nickel is a common binder for
TiC and Cr3C2. Even though the binder constitutes only about 5% to 15%, its effect on
mechanical properties is significant in the composite material. Using WC–Co as an example,
as the percentage of Co is increased, hardness is decreased and transverse rupture strength
(TRS) is increased, as shown in Figure 9.9. TRS correlates with toughness of the WC–Co
composite.
Cutting tools are the most common application of cemented carbides based on
tungsten carbide. Other applications of WC–Co cemented carbides include wire drawing
dies, rock-drilling bits and other mining tools, dies for powder metallurgy, indenters for
hardness testers, and other applications where hardness and wear resistance are critical
requirements.
Titanium carbide cermets are used principally for high temperature applications.
Nickel is the preferred binder; its oxidation resistance at high temperatures is superior to
that of cobalt. Applications include gas-turbine nozzle vanes, valve seats, thermocouple
protection tubes, torch tips, and hot-working spinning tools [11]. TiC–Ni is also used as a
cutting tool material in machining operations.

Compared with WC–Co cemented carbides, nickel-bonded chromium carbides are
more brittle, but have excellent chemical stability and corrosion resistance. This combination, together with good wear resistance, makes it suitable for applications such as gage
blocks, valve liners, spray nozzles, and bearing seal rings [11].
Oxide-based Cermets Most of these composites utilize Al2O3 as the particulate phase;
MgO is another oxide sometimes used. A common metal matrix is chromium, although
other metals can also be used as binders. Relative proportions of the two phases vary
significantly, with the possibility for the metal binder to be the major ingredient. Applications include cutting tools, mechanical seals, and thermocouple shields.

9.2.2 FIBER-REINFORCED METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES
These MMCs are of interest because they combine the high tensile strength and modulus of
elasticity of a fiber with metals of low density, thus achieving good strength-to-weight and
modulus-to-weight ratios in the resulting composite material. Typical metals used as the
low-density matrix are aluminum, magnesium, and titanium. Some of the important fiber
materials used in the composite include Al2O3, boron, carbon, and SiC.
Properties of fiber-reinforced MMCs are anisotropic, as expected. Maximum tensile
strength in the preferred direction is obtained by using continuous fibers bonded strongly to
the matrix metal. Elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composite material increase
with increasing fiber volume. MMCs with fiber reinforcement have good high-temperature
strength properties; and they are good electrical and thermal conductors. Applications
have largely been components in aircraft and turbine machinery, where these properties
can be exploited.

9.3

CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES
Ceramics have certain attractive properties: high stiffness, hardness, hot hardness, and
compressive strength; and relatively low density. Ceramics also have several faults: low
toughness and bulk tensile strength, and susceptibility to thermal cracking. Ceramic matrix
composites (CMCs) represent an attempt to retain the desirable properties of ceramics

while compensating for their weaknesses. CMCs consist of a ceramic primary phase
imbedded with a secondary phase. To date, most development work has focused on the
use of fibers as the secondary phase. Success has been elusive. Technical difficulties include
thermal and chemical compatibility of the constituents in CMCs during processing. Also, as
with any ceramic material, limitations on part geometry must be considered.
Ceramic materials used as matrices include alumina (Al2O3), boron carbide (B4C),
boron nitride (BN), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si3N4), titanium carbide (TiC),
and several types of glass [10]. Some of these materials are still in the development stage
as CMC matrices. Fiber materials in CMCs include carbon, SiC, and Al2O3.
The reinforcing phase in current CMC technology consists of either short fibers, such as
whiskers, or long fibers. Products with short fibers have been successfully fabricated using
particulate processing methods (Chapter 17), the fibers being treated as a form of powder in
these materials. Although there are performance advantages in using long fibers as reinforcement in ceramic matrix composites, development of economical processing techniques for these materials has been difficult. One promising commercial application of CMCs
is in metal-cutting tools as a competitor of cemented carbides, as illustrated in Figure 9.10. The
composite tool material has whiskers of SiC in a matrix of Al2O3. Other potential applications
are in elevated temperatures and environments that are chemically corrosive to other
materials.

9.4

POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES
A polymer matrix composite (PMC) consists of a polymer primary phase in which a
secondary phase is imbedded in the form of fibers, particles, or flakes. Commercially,
PMCs are the most important of the three classes of synthetic composites. They include
most plastic molding compounds, rubber reinforced with carbon black, and fiberreinforced polymers (FRPs). Of the three, FRPs are most closely identified with the
term composite. If one mentions ‘‘composite material’’ to a design engineer, FRP is usually
the composite that comes to mind. Our video clip on composite materials and manufacturing
provides an overview of ﬁber-reinforced polymer composites.

Chapter 9/Composite Materials

9.4.1 FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMERS
A fiber-reinforced polymer is a composite material consisting of a polymer matrix imbedded
with high-strength fibers. The polymer matrix is usually a thermosetting plastic such as
unsaturated polyester or epoxy, but thermoplastic polymers, such as nylons (polyamides),
polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyvinylchloride, are also used. In addition, elastomers are
also reinforced by fibers for rubber products such as tires and conveyor belts.
Fibers in PMCs come in various forms: discontinuous (chopped), continuous, or woven
as a fabric. Principal fiber materials in FRPs are glass, carbon, and Kevlar 49. Less common
fibers include boron, SiC, and Al2O3, and steel. Glass (in particular E-glass) is the most
common fiber material in today’s FRPs; its use to reinforce plastics dates from around 1920.
The term advanced composites is sometimes used in connection with FRPs developed since the late 1960s that use boron, carbon, or Kevlar, as the reinforcing fibers [13].
Epoxy is the common matrix polymer. These composites generally have high fiber content
(>50% by volume) and possess high strength and modulus of elasticity. When two or more
fiber materials are combined in the FRP composite, it is called a hybrid composite.
Advantages cited for hybrids over conventional or advanced FRPs include balanced
strength and stiffness, improved toughness and impact resistance, and reduced weight
[11]. Advanced and hybrid composites are used in aerospace applications.
The most widely used form of the FRP itself is a laminar structure, made by stacking
and bonding thin layers of fiber and polymer until the desired thickness is obtained. By
varying the fiber orientation among the layers, a specified level of anisotropy in properties
can be achieved in the laminate. This method is used to form parts of thin cross section, such
as aircraft wing and fuselage sections, automobile and truck body panels, and boat hulls.
Properties There are a number of attractive features that distinguish fiber-reinforced
plastics as engineering materials. Most notable are (1) high strength-to-weight ratio, (2) high
modulus-to-weight ratio, and (3) low specific gravity. A typical FRP weighs only about onefifth as much as steel; yet strength and modulus are comparable in the fiber direction. Table 9.4
compares these properties for several FRPs, steels, and an aluminum alloy. Properties listed in
Table 9.4 depend on the proportion of fibers in the composite. Both tensile strength and elastic
modulus increase as the fiber content is increased, by Eq. (9.5). Other properties and
characteristics of fiber-reinforced plastics include (4) good fatigue strength; (5) good corrosion resistance, although polymers are soluble in various chemicals; (6) low thermal expansion
for many FRPs, leading to good dimensional stability; and (7) significant anisotropy in

properties. With regard to this last feature, the mechanical properties of the FRPs given in
Table 9.4 are in the direction of the fiber. As previously noted, their values are significantly less
when measured in a different direction.
Applications During the last three decades there has been a steady growth in the
application of fiber-reinforced polymers in products requiring high strength and low weight,
often as substitutions for metals. The aerospace industry is one of the biggest users of
advanced composites. Designers are continually striving to reduce aircraft weight to increase
fuel efficiency and payload capacity. Applications of advanced composites in both military
and commercial aircraft have increased steadily. Much of the structural weight of today’s
airplanes and helicopters consists of FRPs. The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner features 50% (by
weight) composite (carbon fiber-reinforced plastic). That’s about 80% of the volume of the
aircaft. Composites are used for the fuselage, wings, tail, doors, and interior. By comparison,
Boeing’s 777 has only about 12% composites (by weight).
The automotive industry is another important user of FRPs. The most obvious
applications are FRP body panels for cars and truck cabs. A notable example is the
Chevrolet Corvette that has been produced with FRP bodies for decades. Less apparent
applications are in certain chassis and engine parts. Automotive applications differ from
those in aerospace in two significant respects. First, the requirement for high strength-toweight ratio is less demanding than for aircraft. Car and truck applications can use
conventional fiberglass reinforced plastics rather than advanced composites. Second,
production quantities are much higher in automotive applications, requiring more economical methods of fabrication. Continued use of low-carbon sheet steel in automobiles in
the face of FRP’s advantages is evidence of the low cost and processability of steel.
FRPs have been widely adopted for sports and recreational equipment. Fiberglass
reinforced plastic has been used for boat hulls since the 1940s. Fishing rods were another early
application. Today, FRPs are represented in a wide assortment of sports products, including
tennis rackets, golf club shafts, football helmets, bows and arrows, skis, and bicycle wheels.

9.4.2 OTHER POLYMER MATRIX COMPOSITES
In addition to FRPs, other PMCs contain particles, flakes, and short fibers. Ingredients of the
secondary phase are called fillers when used in polymer molding compounds (Section 8.1.5).
Fillers divide into two categories: (1) reinforcements and (2) extenders. Reinforcing fillers
serve to strengthen or otherwise improve mechanical properties of the polymer. Common
examples include: wood flour and powdered mica in phenolic and amino resins to increase
strength, abrasion resistance, and dimensional stability; and carbon black in rubber to
improve strength, wear, and tear resistance. Extenders simply increase the bulk and reduce
the cost-per-unit weight of the polymer, but have little or no effect on mechanical properties.
Extenders may be formulated to improve molding characteristics of the resin.
Foamed polymers (Section 13.11) are a form of composite in which gas bubbles are
imbedded in a polymer matrix. Styrofoam and polyurethane foam are the most common
examples. The combination of near-zero density of the gas and relatively low density of
the matrix makes these materials extremely light weight. The gas mixture also lends very
low thermal conductivity for applications in which heat insulation is required.

GUIDE TO PROCESSING COMPOSITE MATERIALS
Composite materials are formed into shapes by many different processing technologies.
The two phases are typically produced separately before being combined into the

composite part geometry. The matrix phases are generally processed by the technologies
described in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 for metals, ceramics, and polymers.
Processing methods for the imbedded phase depend on geometry. Fiber production
is described in Section 12.2.3 for glass and Section 13.4 for polymers. Fiber production
methods for carbon, boron, and other materials are summarized in Table 15.1. Powder
production for metals is described in Section 16.2 and for ceramics in Section 17.1.1.
Processing techniques to fabricate MMC and CMC components, are similar to those used
for powdered metals and ceramics (Chapters 16 and 17). We deal with the processing of
cermets specifically in Section 17.3.
Molding processes are commonly performed on PMCs, both particle and chopped
fiber types. Molding processes for these composites are the same as those used for
polymers (Chapter 13). Other more specialized processes for polymer matrix composites,
fiber-reinforced polymers in particular, are described in Chapter 15. Many laminated
composite and honeycomb structures are assembled by adhesive bonding (Section 31.3).

In this part of the book, we consider those manufacturing
processes in which the starting work material is either a liquid
or is in a highly plastic condition, and a part is created through
solidification of the material. Casting and molding processes
dominate this category of shaping operations. With reference
to Figure 10.1, the solidification processes can be classified
according to the engineering material that is processed: (1)
metals, (2) ceramics, specifically glasses,1 and (3) polymers
and polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Casting of metals
is covered in this and the following chapter. Glassworking is
covered in Chapter 12, and polymer and PMC processing is
treated in Chapters 13, 14, and 15.
Casting is a process in which molten metal flows by
gravity or other force into a mold where it solidifies in the
shape of the mold cavity. The term casting is also applied to
the part that is made by this process. It is one of the oldest
shaping processes, dating back 6000 years (Historical Note
10.1). The principle of casting seems simple: melt the metal,
pour it into a mold, and let it cool and solidify; yet there are
many factors and variables that must be considered in order
to accomplish a successful casting operation.
Casting includes both the casting of ingots and the
casting of shapes. The term ingot is usually associated with
the primary metals industries; it describes a large casting that
is simple in shape and intended for subsequent reshaping by

Among the ceramics, only glass is processed by solidification; traditional and new ceramics are shaped using particulate processes
(Chapter 17).

Classification of solidification processes.

Origins of casting

C asting of metals can be traced back to around 4000
BCE.

Gold was the first metal to be discovered and used
by the early civilizations; it was malleable and could be
readily hammered into shape at room temperature. There
seemed to be no need for other ways to shape gold. It
was the subsequent discovery of copper that gave rise to
the need for casting. Although copper could be forged to
shape, the process was more difficult (due to strain
hardening) and limited to relatively simple forms.
Historians believe that hundreds of years elapsed before
the process of casting copper was first performed,
probably by accident during the reduction of copper ore
in preparation for hammering the metal into some useful
form. Thus, through serendipity, the art of casting was
born. It is likely that the discovery occurred in
Mesopotamia, and the ‘‘technology’’ quickly spread
throughout the rest of the ancient world.
It was an innovation of significant importance in
the history of mankind. Shapes much more intricate
could be formed by casting than by hammering. More
sophisticated tools and weapons could be fabricated.
More detailed implements and ornaments could be
fashioned. Fine gold jewelry could be made more
beautiful and valuable than by previous methods. Alloys
were first used for casting when it was discovered that

mixtures of copper and tin (the alloy thus formed was
bronze) yielded much better castings than copper alone.
Casting permitted the creation of wealth to those nations
that could perform it best. Egypt ruled the Western
civilized world during the Bronze Age (nearly 2000
years) largely due to its ability to perform the casting
process.
Religion provided an important influence during the
Dark Ages (circa 400 to 1400) for perpetuating the
foundryman’s skills. Construction of cathedrals and
churches required the casting of bells that were used in
these structures. Indeed, the time and effort needed to
cast the large bronze bells of the period helped to move
the casting process from the realm of art toward the
regimen of technology. Advances in melting and moldmaking techniques were made. Pit molding, in which the
molds were formed in a deep pit located in front of the
furnace to simplify the pouring process, was improved as
a casting procedure. In addition, the bellfounder learned
the relationships between the tone of the bell, which was
the important measure of product quality, and its size,
shape, thickness, and metal composition.
Another important product associated with
the development of casting was the cannon.
Chronologically, it followed the bell, and therefore many

E1C10

Section 10.1/Overview of Casting Technology
of the casting techniques developed for bellfounding
were applied to cannon making. The first cast cannon
was made in Ghent, Belgium, in the year 1313—by a
religious monk, of all people. It was made of bronze, and
the bore was formed by means of a core during casting.
Because of the rough bore surface created by the casting

207

process, these early guns were not accurate and had to
be fired at relatively close range to be effective. It was
soon realized that accuracy and range could be
improved if the bore were made smooth by machining
the surface. Quite appropriately, this machining process
was called boring (Section 22.1.5).

processes such as rolling or forging. Ingot casting was discussed in Chapter 6. Shape casting
involves the production of more complex geometries that are much closer to the final
desired shape of the part or product. It is with the casting of shapes rather than ingots that
this chapter and the next are concerned.
A variety of shape casting methods are available, thus making it one of the most
versatile of all manufacturing processes. Among its capabilities and advantages are the
following:
å Casting can be used to create complex part geometries, including both external and
internal shapes.
å Some casting processes are capable of producing parts to net shape. No further
manufacturing operations are required to achieve the required geometry and dimensions of the parts. Other casting processes are near net shape, for which some additional
shape processing is required (usually machining) in order to achieve accurate dimensions and details.
å Casting can be used to produce very large parts. Castings weighing more than 100
tons have been made.
å The casting process can be performed on any metal that can be heated to the liquid state.
å Some casting methods are quite suited to mass production.
There are also disadvantages associated with casting—different disadvantages for
different casting methods. These include limitations on mechanical properties, porosity,
poor dimensional accuracy and surface finish for some casting processes, safety hazards to
humans when processing hot molten metals, and environmental problems.
Parts made by casting processes range in size from small components weighing only
a few ounces up to very large products weighing tons. The list of parts includes dental
crowns, jewelry, statues, wood-burning stoves, engine blocks and heads for automotive
vehicles, machine frames, railway wheels, frying pans, pipes, and pump housings. All
varieties of metals can be cast, ferrous and nonferrous.
Casting can also be used on other materials such as polymers and ceramics; however,
the details are sufficiently different that we postpone discussion of the casting processes for
these materials until later chapters. This chapter and the next deal exclusively with metal
casting. Here we discuss the fundamentals that apply to virtually all casting operations. In
the following chapter, the individual casting processes are described, along with some of the
product design issues that must be considered when making parts out of castings.

10.1

OVERVIEW OF CASTING TECHNOLOGY
As a production process, casting is usually carried out in a foundry. A foundry is a factory
equipped for making molds, melting and handling metal in molten form, performing the
casting process, and cleaning the finished casting. The workers who perform the casting
operations in these factories are called foundrymen.

Chapter 10/Fundamentals of Metal Casting

10.1.1 CASTING PROCESSES
Discussion of casting logically begins with the mold. The mold contains a cavity whose
geometry determines the shape of the cast part. The actual size and shape of the cavity must
be slightly oversized to allow for shrinkage that occurs in the metal during solidification and
cooling. Different metals undergo different amounts of shrinkage, so the mold cavity must
be designed for the particular metal to be cast if dimensional accuracy is critical. Molds are
made of a variety of materials, including sand, plaster, ceramic, and metal. The various
casting processes are often classified according to these different types of molds.
To accomplish a casting operation, the metal is first heated to a temperature high
enough to completely transform it into a liquid state. It is then poured, or otherwise
directed, into the cavity of the mold. In an open mold, Figure 10.2(a), the liquid metal is
simply poured until it fills the open cavity. In a closed mold, Figure 10.2(b), a passageway,
called the gating system, is provided to permit the molten metal to flow from outside the
mold into the cavity. The closed mold is by far the more important category in production
casting operations.
As soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the temperature
drops sufficiently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidification begins. Solidification involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to complete the phase change,
and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is during this step in the process that the
metal assumes the solid shape of the mold cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established.
Once the casting has cooled sufficiently, it is removed from the mold. Depending on the
casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This may include
trimming the excess metal from the actual cast part, cleaning the surface, inspecting the
product, and heat treatment to enhance properties. In addition, machining (Chapter 22) may
be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and to remove the cast surface.
Casting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold used:
expendable-mold casting and permanent-mold casting. An expendable mold means that
the mold in which the molten metal solidifies must be destroyed in order to remove the
casting. These molds are made out of sand, plaster, or similar materials, whose form is
maintained by using binders of various kinds. Sand casting is the most prominent example
of the expendable-mold processes. In sand casting, the liquid metal is poured into a mold

FIGURE 10.2 Two forms of mold: (a) open mold, simply a container in the shape of the desired part; and
(b) closed mold, in which the mold geometry is more complex and requires a gating system (passageway)
leading into the cavity.

made of sand. After the metal hardens, the mold must be sacrificed in order to recover the
casting.
A permanent mold is one that can be used over and over to produce many castings. It
is made of metal (or, less commonly, a ceramic refractory material) that can withstand the
high temperatures of the casting operation. In permanent-mold casting, the mold consists
of two (or more) sections that can be opened to permit removal of the finished part. Die
casting is the most familiar process in this group.
More intricate casting geometries are generally possible with the expendable-mold
processes. Part shapes in the permanent-mold processes are limited by the need to open the
mold. On the other hand, some of the permanent mold processes have certain economic
advantages in high production operations. We discuss the expendable-mold and permanent-mold casting processes in Chapter 11.

10.1.2 SAND-CASTING MOLDS
Sand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will be used
to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms are common to
the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the cross-sectional view of a
typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminology. The mold consists of two
halves: cope and drag. The cope is the upper half of the mold, and the drag is the bottom half.
These two mold parts are contained in a box, called a flask, which is also divided into two
halves, one for the cope and the other for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at
the parting line.
In sand casting (and other expendable-mold processes) the mold cavity is formed by
means of a pattern, which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and has the
shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the pattern, about
half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed, the remaining void has
the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually made oversized to allow for
shrinkage of the metal as it solidifies and cools. The sand for the mold is moist and contains a
binder to maintain its shape.
The cavity in the mold provides the external surfaces of the cast part. In addition, a
casting may have internal surfaces. These surfaces are determined by means of a core, a
form placed inside the mold cavity to define the interior geometry of the part. In sand
casting, cores are generally made of sand, although other materials can be used, such as
metals, plaster, and ceramics.
The gating system in a casting mold is the channel, or network of channels, by which
molten metal flows into the cavity from outside the mold. As shown in the figure, the gating
system typically consists of a downsprue (also called simply the sprue), through which the
metal enters a runner that leads into the main cavity. At the top of the downsprue, a pouring
cup is often used to minimize splash and turbulence as the metal flows into the downsprue.
It is shown in our diagram as a simple cone-shaped funnel. Some pouring cups are designed
in the shape of a bowl, with an open channel leading to the downsprue.
In addition to the gating system, any casting in which shrinkage is significant requires
a riser connected to the main cavity. The riser is a reservoir in the mold that serves as a
source of liquid metal for the casting to compensate for shrinkage during solidification. The
riser must be designed to freeze after the main casting in order to satisfy its function.
As the metal flows into the mold, the air that previously occupied the cavity, as well as
hot gases formed by reactions of the molten metal, must be evacuated so that the metal will
completely fill the empty space. In sand casting, for example, the natural porosity of the
sand mold permits the air and gases to escape through the walls of the cavity. In permanentmetal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or machined into the parting line to
permit removal of air and gases.

Chapter 10/Fundamentals of Metal Casting

10.2 HEATING AND POURING
To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature somewhat
above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. In this section, we
consider several aspects of these two steps in casting.

10.2.1 HEATING THE METAL
Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a molten
temperature sufficient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1) the heat to
raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to convert it from solid to
liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired temperature for pouring.
This can be expressed:



H ¼ rV Cs ðT m  T o Þ þ H f þ Cl T p  T m
where H ¼ total heat required to raise the temperature
of the metal to the pouring

temperature, J (Btu); r ¼ density; g=cm3 lbm/in3 ; Cs ¼ weight specific heat for
the solid metal, J/g-C (Btu/lbm-F); Tm ¼ melting temperature of the metal,  C ( F);
To ¼ starting temperature—usually ambient,  C ( F); Hf ¼ heat of fusion, J/g (Btu/lbm);
Cl ¼ weight specific heat of the liquid metal, J/g-C (Btu/lbm-F); Tp ¼ pouring temperature,  C
( F); and V ¼ volume of metal being heated, cm3 (in3).

Example 10.1
Heating Metal for
Casting

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room temperature to
100 C above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density ¼ 7.5 g/cm3, melting point ¼
800 C, specific heat ¼ 0.33 J/g C in the solid state and 0.29 J/g C in the liquid state; and heat
of fusion ¼ 160 J/g. How much heat energy must be added to accomplish the heating,
assuming no losses?
Solution: We assume ambient temperature in the foundry ¼ 25 C and that the density of
the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one m3 ¼ 106 cm3, and
substituting the property values into Eq. (10.1), we have
 
 
n
H ¼ ð7:5Þ 106 f0:33ð800  25Þ þ 160 þ 0:29ð100Þg ¼ 3335 106 J
The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,
notwithstanding our example calculation. Use of Eq. (10.1) is complicated by the following
factors: (1) Specific heat and other thermal properties of a solid metal vary with temperature,
especially if the metal undergoes a change of phase during heating. (2) A metal’s specific heat
may be different in the solid and liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most
alloys melt over a temperature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single
melting point; thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The
property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily available in most
cases. (5) There are significant heat losses to the environment during heating.

10.2.2 POURING THE MOLTEN METAL
Pouring Temperature
pouring rate
turbulence

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the mold,
including its flow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical step in the casting
process. For this step to be successful, the metal must flow into all regions of the mold before
solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation include pouring temperature, pouring
rate, and turbulence.

E1C10

14:39:17

Page 211

Section 10.2/Heating and Pouring

211

The pouring temperature is the temperature of the molten metal as it is introduced
into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the temperature at
pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for a pure metal
or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is sometimes
referred to as the superheat. This term is also used for the amount of heat that must be
removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidification commences [7].
Pouring rate refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured into the
mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before filling the cavity. If the
pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem. Turbulence in fluid
flow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and direction of the velocity
throughout the fluid. The flow is agitated and irregular rather than smooth and streamlined,
as in laminar flow. Turbulent flow should be avoided during pouring for several reasons. It
tends to accelerate the formation of metal oxides that can become entrapped during
solidification, thus degrading the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates mold
erosion, the gradual wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the flowing molten
metal. The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other fluids we
normally deal with. These molten metals are also much more chemically reactive than at
room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the flow of these metals in the mold is
significant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is especially serious when it
occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the cast part is affected.

10.2.3 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING
There are several relationships that govern the flow of liquid metal through the gating
system and into the mold. An important relationship is Bernoulli’s theorem, which states
that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and friction) at any two points in a
flowing liquid are equal. This can be written in the following form:
h1 þ

p1
v2

r



where h ¼ head, cm (in), p ¼ pressure on the liquid, N=cm2 lb/in2 ; r ¼ density;
g/cm3 (lbm/in3 ); v ¼ flow velocity; cm/s ðin/secÞ; g ¼ gravitational acceleration constant,
981 cm/s/s (32.2  12 ¼ 386 in/sec/sec); and F ¼ head losses due to friction, cm (in). Subscripts
1 and 2 indicate any two locations in the liquid flow.
Bernoulli’s equation can be simplified in several ways. If we ignore friction losses
(to be sure, friction will affect the liquid flow through a sand mold), and assume that the
system remains at atmospheric pressure throughout, then the equation can be reduced to
h1 þ

This can be used to determine the velocity of the molten metal at the base of the sprue.
Let us define point 1 at the top of the sprue and point 2 at its base. If point 2 is used as the
reference plane, then the head at that point is zero (h2 ¼ 0) and h1 is the height (length) of
the sprue. When the metal is poured into the pouring cup and overflows down the sprue, its
initial velocity at the top is zero (v1 ¼ 0). Hence, Eq. (10.3) further simplifies to
h1 ¼

which can be solved for the flow velocity:

Chapter 10/Fundamentals of Metal Casting

where v ¼ the velocity of the liquid metal at the base of the sprue, cm/s (in/sec); g ¼ 981 cm/s/s
(386 in/sec/sec); and h ¼ the height of the sprue, cm (in).
Another relationship of importance during pouring is the continuity law, which
states that the volume rate of flow remains constant throughout the liquid. The volume
flow rate is equal to the velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the flowing
liquid. The continuity law can be expressed:
Q ¼ v1 A1 ¼ v2 A2

ð10:5Þ

where Q ¼ volumetric flow rate, cm3/s (in3/sec); v ¼ velocity as before; A ¼ crosssectional area of the liquid, cm2 (in2); and the subscripts refer to any two points in the
flow system. Thus, an increase in area results in a decrease in velocity, and vice versa.
Equations (10.4) and (10.5) indicate that the sprue should be tapered. As the metal
accelerates during its descent into the sprue opening, the cross-sectional area of the channel
must be reduced; otherwise, as the velocity of the flowing metal increases toward the base of
the sprue, air can be aspirated into the liquid and conducted into the mold cavity. To prevent
this condition, the sprue is designed with a taper, so that the volume flow rate vA is the same
at the top and bottom of the sprue.
Assuming that the runner from the sprue base to the mold cavity is horizontal (and
therefore the head h is the same as at the sprue base), then the volume rate of flow
through the gate and into the mold cavity remains equal to vA at the base. Accordingly,
we can estimate the time required to fill a mold cavity of volume V as
T MF ¼

V
Q

ð10:6Þ

where TMF ¼ mold filling time, s (sec); V ¼ volume of mold cavity, cm3 (in3); and Q ¼ volume
flow rate, as before. The mold filling time computed by Eq. (10.6) must be considered a
minimum time. This is because the analysis ignores friction losses and possible constriction
of flow in the gating system; thus, the mold filling time will be longer than what is given by
Eq. (10.6).

10.2.4 FLUIDITY
The molten metal flow characteristics are often described by the term fluidity, a measure
of the capability of a metal to flow into and fill the mold before freezing. Fluidity is the
inverse of viscosity (Section 3.4); as viscosity increases, fluidity decreases. Standard

testing methods are available to assess fluidity, including the spiral mold test shown in
Figure 10.3, in which fluidity is indicated by the length of the solidified metal in the spiral
channel. A longer cast spiral means greater fluidity of the molten metal.
Factors affecting fluidity include pouring temperature relative to melting point,
metal composition, viscosity of the liquid metal, and heat transfer to the surroundings. A
higher pouring temperature relative to the freezing point of the metal increases the time
it remains in the liquid state, allowing it to flow further before freezing. This tends to
aggravate certain casting problems such as oxide formation, gas porosity, and penetration
of liquid metal into the interstitial spaces between the grains of sand forming the mold.
This last problem causes the surface of the casting to contain imbedded sand particles,
thus making it rougher and more abrasive than normal.
Composition also affects fluidity, particularly with respect to the metal’s solidification mechanism. The best fluidity is obtained by metals that freeze at a constant
temperature (e.g., pure metals and eutectic alloys). When solidification occurs over a
temperature range (most alloys are in this category), the partially solidified portion
interferes with the flow of the liquid portion, thereby reducing fluidity. In addition to the
freezing mechanism, metal composition also determines heat of fusion—the amount of
heat required to solidify the metal from the liquid state. A higher heat of fusion tends to
increase the measured fluidity in casting.

10.3

SOLIDIFICATION AND COOLING
After pouring into the mold, the molten metal cools and solidifies. In this section we
examine the physical mechanism of solidification that occurs during casting. Issues
associated with solidification include the time for a metal to freeze, shrinkage, directional
solidification, and riser design.

10.3.1 SOLIDIFICATION OF METALS
Solidification involves the transformation of the molten metal back into the solid state.
The solidification process differs depending on whether the metal is a pure element or an
alloy.
Pure Metals A pure metal solidifies at a constant temperature equal to its freezing point,
which is the same as its melting point. The melting points of pure metals are well known and
documented (Table 4.1). The process occurs over time as shown in the plot of Figure 10.4,
called a cooling curve. The actual freezing takes time, called the local solidification time in
casting, during which the metal’s latent heat of fusion is released into the surrounding mold.
The total solidification time is the time taken between pouring and complete solidification.

FIGURE 10.4 Cooling
curve for a pure metal
during casting.

After the casting has completely solidified, cooling continues at a rate indicated by the
downward slope of the cooling curve.
Because of the chilling action of the mold wall, a thin skin of solid metal is initially
formed at the interface immediately after pouring. Thickness of the skin increases to form
a shell around the molten metal as solidification progresses inward toward the center of
the cavity. The rate at which freezing proceeds depends on heat transfer into the mold, as
well as the thermal properties of the metal.
It is of interest to examine the metallic grain formation and growth during this
solidification process. The metal which forms the initial skin has been rapidly cooled by the
extraction of heat through the mold wall. This cooling action causes the grains in the skin to
be fine and randomly oriented. As cooling continues, further grain formation and growth
occur in a direction away from the heat transfer. Since the heat transfer is through the skin
and mold wall, the grains grow inwardly as needles or spines of solid metal. As these spines
enlarge, lateral branches form, and as these branches grow, further branches form at right
angles to the first branches. This type of grain growth is referred to as dendritic growth, and
it occurs not only in the freezing of pure metals but alloys as well. These treelike structures
are gradually filled-in during freezing, as additional metal is continually deposited onto the
dendrites until complete solidification has occurred. The grains resulting from this dendritic
growth take on a preferred orientation, tending to be coarse, columnar grains aligned
toward the center of the casting. The resulting grain formation is illustrated in Figure 10.5.
Most Alloys Most alloys freeze over a temperature range rather than at a single temperature. The exact range depends on the alloy system and the particular composition.

Solidification of an alloy can be explained with reference to Figure 10.6, which shows the
phase diagram for a particular alloy system (Section 6.1.2) and the cooling curve for a given
composition. As temperature drops, freezing begins at the temperature indicated by the
liquidus and is completed when the solidus is reached. The start of freezing is similar to that of
the pure metal. A thin skin is formed at the mold wall due to the large temperature gradient at
this surface. Freezing then progresses as before through the formation of dendrites that grow
away from the walls. However, owing to the temperature spread between the liquidus and
solidus, the nature of the dendritic growth is such that an advancing zone is formed in which
both liquid and solid metal coexist. The solid portions are the dendrite structures that have
formed sufficiently to trap small islands of liquid metal in the matrix. This solid–liquid region
has a soft consistency that has motivated its name as the mushy zone. Depending on the
conditions of freezing, the mushy zone can be relatively narrow, or it can exist throughout most
of the casting. The latter condition is promoted by factors such as slow heat transfer out of
the hot metal and a wide difference between liquidus and solidus temperatures. Gradually, the
liquid islands in the dendrite matrix solidify as the temperature of the casting drops to the
solidus for the given alloy composition.
Another factor complicating solidification of alloys is that the composition of the
dendrites as they start to form favors the metal with the higher melting point. As freezing
continues and the dendrites grow, there develops an imbalance in composition between the
metal that has solidified and the remaining molten metal. This composition imbalance is
finally manifested in the completed casting in the form of segregation of the elements. The
segregation is of two types, microscopic and macroscopic. At the microscopic level, the
chemical composition varies throughout each individual grain. This is due to the fact that
the beginning spine of each dendrite has a higher proportion of one of the elements in the alloy.
As the dendrite grows in its local vicinity, it must expand using the remaining liquid metal that
has been partially depleted of the first component. Finally, the last metal to freeze in each grain
is that which has been trapped by the branches of the dendrite, and its composition is even
further out of balance. Thus, we have a variation in chemical composition within single grains
of the casting.
At the macroscopic level, the chemical composition varies throughout the entire
casting. Since the regions of the casting that freeze first (at the outside near the mold walls) are
richer in one component than the other, the remaining molten alloy is deprived of that
component by the time freezing occurs at the interior. Thus, there is a general segregation

through the cross-section of the casting, sometimes called ingot segregation, as illustrated in
Figure 10.7.
Eutectic Alloys Eutectic alloys constitute an exception to the general process by which
alloys solidify. A eutectic alloy is a particular composition in an alloy system for which the
solidus and liquidus are at the same temperature. Hence, solidification occurs at a constant
temperature rather than over a temperature range, as described above. The effect can be
seen in the phase diagram of the lead–tin system shown in Figure 6.3. Pure lead has a melting
point of 327 C (621 F), while pure tin melts at 232 C (450 F). Although most lead–tin alloys
exhibit the typical solidus–liquidus temperature range, the particular composition of 61.9%
tin and 38.1% lead has a melting (freezing) point of 183 C (362 F). This composition is the
eutectic composition of the lead–tin alloy system, and 183 C is its eutectic temperature.
Lead–tin alloys are not commonly used in casting, but Pb–Sn compositions near the eutectic
are used for electrical soldering, where the low melting point is an advantage. Examples of
eutectic alloys encountered in casting include aluminum–silicon (11.6% Si) and cast iron
(4.3% C).

10.3.2 SOLIDIFICATION TIME
Whether the casting is pure metal or alloy, solidification takes time. The total solidification time is the time required for the casting to solidify after pouring. This time is
dependent on the size and shape of the casting by an empirical relationship known as
Chvorinov’s rule, which states:
 n
V
T TS ¼ Cm
ð10:7Þ
A
where TTS ¼ total solidification time, min; V ¼ volume of the casting, cm3 (in3); A ¼ surface
area of the casting, cm2 (in2); n is an exponent usually taken to have a value ¼ 2; and Cm is
the mold constant. Given that n ¼ 2, the units of Cm are min/cm2 (min/in2), and its value
depends on the particular conditions of the casting operation, including mold material (e.g.,
specific heat, thermal conductivity), thermal properties of the cast metal (e.g., heat of
fusion, specific heat, thermal conductivity), and pouring temperature relative to the
melting point of the metal. The value of Cm for a given casting operation can be based
on experimental data from previous operations carried out using the same mold material,
metal, and pouring temperature, even though the shape of the part may be quite different.
Chvorinov’s rule indicates that a casting with a higher volume-to-surface area ratio
will cool and solidify more slowly than one with a lower ratio. This principle is put to good
use in designing the riser in a mold. To perform its function of feeding molten metal to the
main cavity, the metal in the riser must remain in the liquid phase longer than the casting. In
other words, the TTS for the riser must exceed the TTS for the main casting. Since the mold
conditions for both riser and casting are the same, their mold constants will be equal. By

designing the riser to have a larger volume-to-area ratio, we can be fairly sure that the main
casting solidifies first and that the effects of shrinkage are minimized. Before considering
how the riser might be designed using Chvorinov’s rule, let us consider the topic of
shrinkage, which is the reason why risers are needed.

10.3.3 SHRINKAGE
Our discussion of solidification has neglected the impact of shrinkage that occurs during
cooling and freezing. Shrinkage occurs in three steps: (1) liquid contraction during cooling
prior to solidification; (2) contraction during the phase change from liquid to solid, called
solidification shrinkage; and (3) thermal contraction of the solidified casting during
cooling to room temperature. The three steps can be explained with reference to a
cylindrical casting made in an open mold, as shown in Figure 10.8. The molten metal
immediately after pouring is shown in part (0) of the series. Contraction of the liquid metal
during cooling from pouring temperature to freezing temperature causes the height of the
liquid to be reduced from its starting level as in (1) of the figure. The amount of this liquid
contraction is usually around 0.5%. Solidification shrinkage, seen in part (2), has two
effects. First, contraction causes a further reduction in the height of the casting. Second,
the amount of liquid metal available to feed the top center portion of the casting becomes
restricted. This is usually the last region to freeze, and the absence of metal creates a void
in the casting at this location. This shrinkage cavity is called a pipe by foundrymen. Once

solidified, the casting experiences further contraction in height and diameter while
cooling, as in (3). This shrinkage is determined by the solid metal’s coefficient of thermal
expansion, which in this case is applied in reverse to determine contraction.
Solidification shrinkage occurs in nearly all metals because the solid phase has a
higher density than the liquid phase. The phase transformation that accompanies solidification causes a reduction in the volume per unit weight of metal. The exception is cast iron
containing high carbon content, whose solidification during the final stages of freezing is
complicated by a period of graphitization, which results in expansion that tends to
counteract the volumetric decrease associated with the phase change [7]. Compensation
for solidification shrinkage is achieved in several ways depending on the casting operation.
In sand casting, liquid metal is supplied to the cavity by means of risers (Section 10.3.5). In
die casting (Section 11.3.3), the molten metal is applied under pressure.
Pattern-makers account for thermal contraction by making the mold cavities
oversized. The amount by which the mold must be made larger relative to the final casting
size is called the pattern shrinkage allowance. Although the shrinkage is volumetric, the
dimensions of the casting are expressed linearly, so the allowances must be applied
accordingly. Special ‘‘shrink rules’’ with slightly elongated scales are used to make the patterns
and molds larger than the desired casting by the appropriate amount. Table 10.1 lists typical values
of linear shrinkage for various cast metals; these values can be used to determine shrink rule scales.

10.3.4 DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION
In order to minimize the damaging effects of shrinkage, it is desirable for the regions of the
castingmostdistantfromtheliquid metal supplytofreezefirstandforsolidificationto progress
from these remote regions toward the riser(s). In this way, molten metal will continually be
available from the risers to prevent shrinkage voids during freezing. The term directional
solidification is used to describe thisaspect of the freezing process and the methods by which it
iscontrolled.ThedesireddirectionalsolidificationisachievedbyobservingChvorinov’srulein
the design of the casting itself, its orientation within the mold, and the design of the riser system
that feeds it. For example, by locating sections of the casting with lower V/A ratios away from
theriser,freezingwill occur firstintheseregionsandthesupplyofliquidmetal fortherestofthe
casting will remain open until these bulkier sections solidify.
Another way to encourage directional solidification is to use chills—internal or
external heat sinks that cause rapid freezing in certain regions of the casting. Internal chills
are small metal parts placed inside the cavity before pouring so that the molten metal will
solidify first around these parts. The internal chill should have a chemical composition
similar to the metal being poured, most readily achieved by making the chill out of the same
metal as the casting itself.
External chills are metal inserts in the walls of the mold cavity that can remove
heat from the molten metal more rapidly than the surrounding sand in order to promote
solidification. They are often used effectively in sections of the casting that are difficult to

feed with liquid metal, thus encouraging rapid freezing in these sections while the
connection to liquid metal is still open. Figure 10.9 illustrates a possible application of
external chills and the likely result in the casting if the chill were not used.
As important as it is to initiate freezing in the appropriate regions of the cavity, it is also
important to avoid premature solidification in sections of the mold nearest the riser. Of
particular concern is the passageway between the riser and the main cavity. This connection
must be designed in such a way that it does not freeze before the casting, which would isolate
the casting from the molten metal in the riser. Although it is generally desirable to minimize
the volume in the connection (to reduce wasted metal), the cross-sectional area must be
sufficient to delay the onset of freezing. This goal is usually aided by making the passageway
short in length, so that it absorbs heat from the molten metal in the riser and the casting.

10.3.5 RISER DESIGN
As described earlier, a riser, Figure 10.2(b), is used in a sand-casting mold to feed liquid
metal to the casting during freezing in order to compensate for solidification shrinkage.
To function, the riser must remain molten until after the casting solidifies. Chvorinov’s
rule can be used to compute the size of a riser that will satisfy this requirement. The
following example illustrates the calculation.

Example 10.3
Riser Design
Using
Chvorinov’s Rule

A cylindrical riser must be designed for a sand-casting mold. The casting itself is a steel
rectangular plate with dimensions 7:5 cm  12:5 cm  2:0 cm. Previous observations have
indicated that the total solidification time (TTS) for this casting ¼ 1.6 min. The cylinder for
the riser will have a diameter-to-height ratio ¼ 1.0. Determine the dimensions of the riser so
that its TTS ¼ 2.0 min.
Solution: First determine the V/A ratio for the plate. Its volume V ¼ 7:5  12:5  2:0 ¼
187:5 cm3 , and its surface area A ¼ 2ð7:5  12:5 þ 7:5  2:0 þ 12:5  2:0Þ ¼ 267:5 cm2 .
Given that TTS ¼ 1.6 min, we can determine the mold constant Cm from Eq. (10.7),
using a value of n ¼ 2 in the equation.
Cm ¼

T TS
(V=A)2

¼

1:6
(187:5=267:5)2

¼ 3:26 min=cm2

Next we must design the riser so that its total solidification time is 2.0 min, using the same
value of mold constant. The volume of the riser is given by
V¼

E1C10

Chapter 10/Fundamentals of Metal Casting

and the surface area is given by
A ¼ p Dh þ

2p D2
4

Since we are using a D/H ratio ¼ 1.0, then D ¼ H. Substituting D for H in the volume and
area formulas, we get
V ¼ pD3 =4
and
A ¼ p D2 þ 2p D2 =4 ¼ 1:5p D2
Thus the V=A ratio ¼ D=6. Using this ratio in Chvorinov’s equation, we have
 2
D
T TS ¼ 2:0 ¼ 3:26
¼ 0:09056 D2
6
D2 ¼ 2:0=0:09056 ¼ 22:086 cm2
D ¼ 4:7 cm
Since H ¼ D; then H ¼ 4:7 cm also.
The riser represents waste metal that will be separated from the cast part and remelted
to make subsequent castings. It is desirable for the volume of metal in the riser to be a
minimum. Since the geometry of the riser is normally selected to maximize the V/A ratio, this
tends to reduce the riser volume as much as possible. Note that the volume of the riser in our
example problem is V ¼ pð4:7Þ3 =4 ¼ 81:5 cm3, only 44% of the volume of the plate
(casting), even though its total solidification time is 25% longer.
Risers can be designed in different forms. The design shown in Figure 10.2(b) is a
side riser. It is attached to the side of the casting by means of a small channel. A top riser
is one that is connected to the top surface of the casting. Risers can be open or blind. An
open riser is exposed to the outside at the top surface of the cope. This has the
disadvantage of allowing more heat to escape, promoting faster solidification. A blind
n
riser is entirely enclosed within the mold, as in Figure 10.1(b).

metal flowing through the base of the downsprue,
(b) the volume rate of flow, and (c) the time
required to fill the mold cavity.
The flow rate of liquid metal into the downsprue of
a mold ¼ 1 L/s. The cross-sectional area at the top
of the sprue ¼ 800 mm2, and its length ¼ 175 mm.
What area should be used at the base of the sprue
to avoid aspiration of the molten metal?
The volume rate of flow of molten metal into the
downsprue from the pouring cup is 50 in3/sec. At
the top where the pouring cup leads into the downsprue, the cross-sectional area ¼ 1.0 in2. Determine
what the area should be at the bottom of the sprue
if its length ¼ 8.0 in. It is desired to maintain a
constant flow rate, top and bottom, in order to
avoid aspiration of the liquid metal.
Molten metal can be poured into the pouring cup
of a sand mold at a steady rate of 1000 cm3/s. The
molten metal overflows the pouring cup and flows
into the downsprue. The cross-section of the sprue
is round, with a diameter at the top ¼ 3.4 cm. If the
sprue is 25 cm long, determine the proper diameter
at its base so as to maintain the same volume flow
rate.
During pouring into a sand mold, the molten
metal can be poured into the downsprue at a
constant flow rate during the time it takes to
fill the mold. At the end of pouring the sprue is
filled and there is negligible metal in the pouring
cup. The downsprue is 6.0 in long. Its cross-sectional
area at the top ¼ 0.8 in2 and at the base ¼ 0.6 in2. The
cross-sectional area of the runner leading from the
sprue also ¼ 0.6 in2, and it is 8.0 in long before
leading into the mold cavity, whose volume ¼ 65 in3.

after solidification to be 1.3%. If the availability of
molten metal in the mold allows the square shape of
the cast plate to maintain its 200 mm  200 mm
dimensions until solidification is completed, determine the final dimensions of the plate.

Solidification Time and Riser Design
10.12. In the casting of steel under certain mold conditions,

Metal casting processes divide into two categories, based
on mold type: (1) expendable mold and (2) permanent
mold. In expendable mold casting operations, the mold is
sacrificed in order to remove the cast part. Since a new
mold is required for each new casting, production rates in
expendable-mold processes are often limited by the time
required to make the mold rather than the time to make the
casting itself. However, for certain part geometries, sand
molds can be produced and castings made at rates of 400
parts per hour and higher. In permanent-mold casting
processes, the mold is fabricated out of metal (or other
durable material) and can be used many times to make
many castings. Accordingly, these processes possess a natural advantage in terms of higher production rates.
Our discussion of casting processes in this chapter is
organized as follows: (1) sand casting, (2) other expendable-mold casting processes, and (3) permanent-mold casting processes. The chapter also includes casting equipment
and practices used in foundries. Another section deals with
inspection and quality issues. Product design guidelines are
presented in the final section.

11.1 SAND CASTING
Sand casting is the most widely used casting process,
accounting for a significant majority of the total tonnage
cast. Nearly all casting alloys can be sand cast; indeed, it is
one of the few processes that can be used for metals with
high melting temperatures, such as steels, nickels, and
titaniums. Its versatility permits the casting of parts ranging
in size from small to very large (Figure 11.1) and in
production quantities from one to millions.
Sand casting, also known as sand-mold casting,
consists of pouring molten metal into a sand mold, allowing the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mold to
remove the casting. The casting must then be cleaned and

inspected, and heat treatment is sometimes required to improve metallurgical properties. The cavity in the sand mold is formed by packing sand around a pattern (an
approximate duplicate of the part to be cast), and then removing the pattern by
separating the mold into two halves. The mold also contains the gating and riser system.
In addition, if the casting is to have internal surfaces (e.g., hollow parts or parts with
holes), a core must be included in the mold. Since the mold is sacrificed to remove the

casting, a new sand mold must be made for each part that is produced. From this brief
description, sand casting is seen to include not only the casting operation itself, but also
the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the mold. The production sequence is
outlined in Figure 11.2 Our video clip on casting contains a segment on sand casting.

11.1.1 PATTERNS AND CORES
Sand casting requires a pattern—a full-sized model of the part, enlarged to account for
shrinkage and machining allowances in the final casting. Materials used to make patterns
include wood, plastics, and metals. Wood is a common pattern material because it is easily
shaped. Its disadvantages are that it tends to warp, and it is abraded by the sand being
compacted around it, thus limiting the number of times it can be reused. Metal patterns are
more expensive to make, but they last much longer. Plastics represent a compromise
between wood and metal. Selection of the appropriate pattern material depends to a large
extent on the total quantity of castings to be made.
There are various types of patterns, as illustrated in Figure 11.3. The simplest is
made of one piece, called a solid pattern—same geometry as the casting, adjusted in size
for shrinkage and machining. Although it is the easiest pattern to fabricate, it is not the
easiest to use in making the sand mold. Determining the location of the parting line
between the two halves of the mold for a solid pattern can be a problem, and
incorporating the gating system and sprue into the mold is left to the judgment and
skill of the foundry worker. Consequently, solid patterns are generally limited to very low
production quantities.
Split patterns consist of two pieces, dividing the part along a plane coinciding with
the parting line of the mold. Split patterns are appropriate for complex part geometries
and moderate production quantities. The parting line of the mold is predetermined by the
two pattern halves, rather than by operator judgment.
For higher production quantities, match-plate patterns or cope-and-drag patterns
are used. In match-plate patterns, the two pieces of the split pattern are attached to
opposite sides of a wood or metal plate. Holes in the plate allow the top and bottom (cope

and drag) sections of the mold to be aligned accurately. Cope-and-drag patterns are
similar to match-plate patterns except that split pattern halves are attached to separate
plates, so that the cope and drag sections of the mold can be fabricated independently,
instead of using the same tooling for both. Part (d) of the figure includes the gating and
riser system in the cope-and-drag patterns.
Patterns define the external shape of the cast part. If the casting is to have internal
surfaces, a core is required. A core is a full-scale model of the interior surfaces of the part. It
is inserted into the mold cavity prior to pouring, so that the molten metal will flow and
solidify between the mold cavity and the core to form the casting’s external and internal
surfaces. The core is usually made of sand, compacted into the desired shape. As with the
pattern, the actual size of the core must include allowances for shrinkage and machining.
Depending on the geometry of the part, the core may or may not require supports to hold it
in position in the mold cavity during pouring. These supports, called chaplets, are made of a
metal with a higher melting temperature than the casting metal. For example, steel chaplets
would be used for cast iron castings. On pouring and solidification, the chaplets become
bonded into the casting. A possible arrangement of a core in a mold using chaplets is
sketched in Figure 11.4. The portion of the chaplet protruding from the casting is
subsequently cut off.

11.1.2 MOLDS AND MOLD MAKING
Foundry sands are silica (SiO2) or silica mixed with other minerals. The sand should possess
good refractory properties—capacity to stand up under high temperatures without melting
or otherwise degrading. Other important features of the sand include grain size, distribution of grain size in the mixture, and shape of the individual grains (Section 16.1). Small
grain size provides a better surface finish on the cast part, but large grain size is more
permeable (to allow escape of gases during pouring). Molds made from grains of irregular
shape tend to be stronger than molds of round grains because of interlocking, yet interlocking tends to restrict permeability.
In making the mold, the grains of sand are held together by a mixture of water and
bonding clay. A typical mixture (by volume) is 90% sand, 3% water, and 7% clay. Other
bonding agents can be used in place of clay, including organic resins (e.g., phenolic resins)
and inorganic binders (e.g., sodium silicate and phosphate). Besides sand and binder,
additives are sometimes combined with the mixture to enhance properties such as
strength and/or permeability of the mold.

To form the mold cavity, the traditional method is to compact the molding sand
around the pattern for both cope and drag in a container called a flask. The packing
process is performed by various methods. The simplest is hand ramming, accomplished
manually by a foundry worker. In addition, various machines have been developed to
mechanize the packing procedure. These machines operate by any of several mechanisms, including (1) squeezing the sand around the pattern by pneumatic pressure; (2) a
jolting action in which the sand, contained in the flask with the pattern, is dropped
repeatedly in order to pack it into place; and (3) a slinging action, in which the sand grains
are impacted against the pattern at high speed.
An alternative to traditional flasks for each sand mold is flaskless molding, which
refers to the use of one master flask in a mechanized system of mold production. Each sand
mold is produced using the same master flask. Mold production rates up to 600 per hour are
claimed for this more automated method [8].
Severalindicatorsare usedtodetermine the quality of the sandmold [7]: (1) strength—
the mold’s ability to maintain its shape and resist erosion caused by the flow of molten metal;
it depends on grain shape, adhesive qualities of the binder, and other factors; (2) permeability—capacity of the mold to allow hot air and gases from the casting operation to pass
through the voids in the sand; (3) thermal stability—ability of the sand at the surface of the
mold cavity to resist cracking and buckling upon contact with the molten metal; (4)
collapsibility—ability of the mold to give way and allow the casting to shrink without
cracking the casting; it also refers to the ability to remove the sand from the casting during
cleaning; and (5) reusability—can the sand from the broken mold be reused to make other
molds? These measures are sometimes incompatible; for example, a mold with greater
strength is less collapsible.
Sand molds are often classified as green-sand, dry-sand, or skin-dried molds. Greensand molds are made of a mixture of sand, clay, and water, the word green referring to the fact
that the mold contains moisture at the time of pouring. Green-sand molds possess sufficient
strength for most applications, good collapsibility, good permeability, good reusability, and are
the least expensive of the molds. They are the most widely used mold type, but they are not
without problems. Moisture in the sand can cause defects in some castings, depending on the
metal and geometry of the part. A dry-sand mold is made using organic binders rather than
clay, and the mold is baked in a large oven at temperatures ranging from 200 C to 320 C
(392 F to 608 F) [8]. Oven baking strengthens the mold and hardens the cavity surface. A drysand mold provides better dimensional control in the cast product, compared to green-sand
molding. However, dry-sand molding is more expensive, and production rate is reduced
because of drying time. Applications are generally limited to medium and large castings in low
to medium production rates. In a skin-dried mold, the advantages of a dry-sand mold is
partially achieved by drying the surface of a green-sand mold to a depth of 10 to 25 mm (0.4–1
in) at the mold cavity surface, using torches, heating lamps, or other means. Special bonding
materials must be added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface.
The preceding mold classifications refer to the use of conventional binders
consisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to
these classifications, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not based on
either of these traditional binder ingredients. Some of the binder materials used in these
‘‘no-bake’’ systems include furan resins (consisting of furfural alcohol, urea, and
formaldehyde), phenolics, and alkyd oils. No-bake molds are growing in popularity
due to their good dimensional control in high production applications.

11.1.3 THE CASTING OPERATION
After the core is positioned (if one is used) and the two halves of the mold are clamped
together, then casting is performed. Casting consists of pouring, solidification, and cooling

of the cast part (Sections 10.2 and 10.3). The gating and riser system in the mold must be
designed to deliver liquid metal into the cavity and provide for a sufficient reservoir of
molten metal during solidification shrinkage. Air and gases must be allowed to escape.
One of the hazards during pouring is that the buoyancy of the molten metal will
displace the core. Buoyancy results from the weight of molten metal being displaced by the
core, according to Archimedes’ principle. The force tending to lift the core is equal to the
weight of the displaced liquid less the weight of the core itself. Expressing the situation in
equation form,
Fb ¼ Wm  Wc

ð11:1Þ

where Fb ¼ buoyancy force, N (lb); Wm ¼ weight of molten metal displaced, N (lb); and %
Wc ¼ weight of the core, N (lb). Weights are determined as the volume of the core
multiplied by the respective densities of the core material (typically sand) and the metal
being cast. The density of a sand core is approximately 1.6 g/cm3 (0.058 lb/in3). Densities of
several common casting alloys are given in Table 11.1.

Example 11.1
Buoyancy in Sand
Casting

A sand core has a volume ¼ 1875 cm3 and is located inside a sand mold cavity. Determine
the buoyancy force tending to lift the core during pouring of molten lead into the mold.
Solution: Density of the sand core is 1.6 g/cm3. Weight of the core is 1875(1.6) ¼ 3000 g ¼
3.0 kg. Density of lead, based on Table 11.1, is 11.3 g/cm3. The weight of lead displaced by the
core is 1875(11.3) ¼ 21,188 g ¼ 21.19 kg. The difference ¼ 21.19  3.0 ¼ 18.19 kg. Given that 1
kg ¼ 9.81 N, the buoyancy force is therefore Fb ¼ 9.81(18.19) ¼ 178.4 N.
Following solidification and cooling, the sand mold is broken away from the casting
to retrieve the part. The part is then cleaned—gating and riser system are separated, and
n
sand is removed. The casting is then inspected (Section 11.5).

11.2 OTHER EXPENDABLE-MOLD CASTING PROCESSES
As versatile as sand casting is, there are other casting processes that have been developed to
meet special needs. The differences between these methods are in the composition of the
mold material, or the manner in which the mold is made, or in the way the pattern is made.

11.2.1 SHELL MOLDING
Shell molding is a casting process in which the mold is a thin shell (typically 9 mm or 3/8 in)
made of sand held together by a thermosetting resin binder. Developed in Germany during
the early 1940s, the process is described and illustrated in Figure 11.5.

231

FIGURE 11.5 Steps in shell molding: (1) a match-plate or cope-and-drag metal pattern is heated and
placed over a box containing sand mixed with thermosetting resin; (2) box is inverted so that sand and
resin fall onto the hot pattern, causing a layer of the mixture to partially cure on the surface to form a
hard shell; (3) box is repositioned so that loose, uncured particles drop away; (4) sand shell is heated in
oven for several minutes to complete curing; (5) shell mold is stripped from the pattern; (6) two halves of
the shell mold are assembled, supported by sand or metal shot in a box, and pouring is accomplished.
The finished casting with sprue removed is shown in (7).

There are many advantages to the shell-molding process. The surface of the shellmold cavity is smoother than a conventional green-sand mold, and this smoothness permits
easier flow of molten metal during pouring and better surface finish on the final casting.
Finishes of 2.5 mm (100 m-in) can be obtained. Good dimensional accuracy is also achieved,
with tolerances of 0.25 mm (0.010 in) possible on small-to-medium-sized parts. The
good finish and accuracy often precludes the need for further machining. Collapsibility of
the mold is generally sufficient to avoid tearing and cracking of the casting.
Disadvantages of shell molding include a more expensive metal pattern than the
corresponding pattern for green-sand molding. This makes shell molding difficult to
justify for small quantities of parts. Shell molding can be mechanized for mass production
and is very economical for large quantities. It seems particularly suited to steel castings of
less than 20 lb. Examples of parts made using shell molding include gears, valve bodies,
bushings, and camshafts.

11.2.2 VACUUM MOLDING
Vacuum molding, also called the V-process, was developed in Japan around 1970. It uses a
sand mold held together by vacuum pressure rather than by a chemical binder. Accordingly,
the term vacuum in this process refers to the making of the mold rather than the casting
operation itself. The steps of the process are explained in Figure 11.6.
Because no binders are used, the sand is readily recovered in vacuum molding.
Also, the sand does not require extensive mechanical reconditioning normally done when

FIGURE 11.6 Steps in vacuum molding: (1) a thin sheet of preheated plastic is drawn over a match-plate
or cope-and-drag pattern by vacuum—the pattern has small vent holes to facilitate vacuum forming; (2) a
specially designed flask is placed over the pattern plate and filled with sand, and a sprue and pouring cup
are formed in the sand; (3) another thin plastic sheet is placed over the flask, and a vacuum is drawn that
causes the sand grains to be held together, forming a rigid mold; (4) the vacuum on the mold pattern is
released to permit the pattern to be stripped from the mold; (5) this mold is assembled with its matching
half to form the cope and drag, and with vacuum maintained on both halves, pouring is accomplished. The
plastic sheet quickly burns away on contacting the molten metal. After solidification, nearly all of the sand
can be recovered for reuse.

binders are used in the molding sand. Since no water is mixed with the sand, moisturerelated defects are absent from the product. Disadvantages of the V-process are that it is
relatively slow and not readily adaptable to mechanization.

11.2.3 EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE PROCESS
The expanded polystyrene casting process uses a mold of sand packed around a polystyrene foam pattern that vaporizes when the molten metal is poured into the mold. The
process and variations of it are known by other names, including lost-foam process, lostpattern process, evaporative-foam process, and full-mold process (the last being a trade
name). The foam pattern includes the sprue, risers, and gating system, and it may also
contain internal cores (if needed), thus eliminating the need for a separate core in
the mold. Also, since the foam pattern itself becomes the cavity in the mold, considerations
of draft and parting lines can be ignored. The mold does not have to be opened into
cope and drag sections. The sequence in this casting process is illustrated and described in
Figure 11.7. Various methods for making the pattern can be used, depending on the
quantities of castings to be produced. For one-of-a-kind castings, the foam is manually cut
from large strips and assembled to form the pattern. For large production runs, an

automated molding operation can be set up to mold the patterns prior to making the molds
for casting. The pattern is normally coated with a refractory compound to provide a
smoother surface on the pattern and to improve its high temperature resistance. Molding
sands usually include bonding agents. However, dry sand is used in certain processes in this
group, which aids recovery and reuse. The video clip on casting features a segment titled
Evaporative-Foam Casting.

A significant advantage for this process is that the pattern need not be removed
from the mold. This simplifies and expedites mold making. In a conventional green-sand
mold, two halves are required with proper parting lines, draft allowances must be
provided in the mold design, cores must be inserted, and the gating and riser system
must be added. With the expanded polystyrene process, these steps are built into the
pattern itself. A new pattern is needed for every casting, so the economics of
the expanded polystyrene casting process depend largely on the cost of producing the
patterns. The process has been applied to mass produce castings for automobiles engines.
Automated production systems are installed to mold the polystyrene foam patterns for
these applications.

11.2.4 INVESTMENT CASTING
In investment casting, a pattern made of wax is coated with a refractory material to
make the mold, after which the wax is melted away prior to pouring the molten metal.
The term investment comes from one of the less familiar definitions of the word invest,
which is ‘‘to cover completely,’’ this referring to the coating of the refractory material
around the wax pattern. It is a precision casting process, because it is capable of making
castings of high accuracy and intricate detail. The process dates back to ancient Egypt
(Historical Note 11.1) and is also known as the lost-wax process, because the wax
pattern is lost from the mold prior to casting.

Investment casting

he lost wax casting process was developed by the
ancient Egyptians some 3500 years ago. Although
written records do not identify when the invention
occurred or the artisan responsible, historians
speculate that the process resulted from the close
association between pottery and molding in early
times. It was the potter who crafted the molds that
were used for casting. The idea for the lost wax
process must have originated with a potter who was
familiar with the casting process. As he was working
one day on a ceramic piece—perhaps an ornate vase
or bowl—it occurred to him that the article might be
more attractive and durable if made of metal. So he
fashioned a core in the general shape of the piece, but
smaller than the desired final dimensions, and coated
it with wax to establish the size. The wax proved to be

an easy material to form, and intricate designs and
shapes could be created by the craftsman. On the
wax surface, he carefully plastered several layers of
clay and devised a means of holding the resulting
components together. He then baked the mold in a
kiln, so that the clay hardened and the wax melted
and drained out to form a cavity. At last, he poured
molten bronze into the cavity and, after the casting
had solidified and cooled, broke away the mold to
recover the part. Considering the education and
experience of this early pottery maker and the tools he
had to work with, development of the lost wax casting
process demonstrated great innovation and insight.
‘‘No other process can be named by archeologists so
crowded with deduction, engineering ability and
ingenuity’’ [14].

covering the coated tree with sufficient refractory material to make it rigid; (5) the mold is held in an inverted position
and heated to melt the wax and permit it to drip out of the cavity; (6) the mold is preheated to a high temperature, which
ensures that all contaminants are eliminated from the mold; it also permits the liquid metal to flow more easily into the
detailed cavity; the molten metal is poured; it solidifies; and (7) the mold is broken away from the finished casting. Parts
are separated from the sprue.

Steps in investment casting are described in Figure 11.8. Since the wax pattern is
melted off after the refractory mold is made, a separate pattern must be made for every
casting. Pattern production is usually accomplished by a molding operation—pouring or
injecting the hot wax into a master die that has been designed with proper allowances for
shrinkage of both wax and subsequent metal casting. In cases where the part geometry is
complicated, several separate wax pieces must be joined to make the pattern. In highproduction operations, several patterns are attached to a sprue, also made of wax, to form
a pattern tree; this is the geometry that will be cast out of metal. The video clip on casting
contains a segment on investment casting.
VIDEO CLIP
Casting: View the segment titled Investment Casting.

Coating with refractory (step 3) is usually accomplished by dipping the pattern
tree into a slurry of very fine grained silica or other refractory (almost in powder form)
mixed with plaster to bond the mold into shape. The small grain size of the refractory
material provides a smooth surface and captures the intricate details of the wax pattern.
The final mold (step 4) is accomplished by repeatedly dipping the tree into the refractory
slurry or by gently packing the refractory around the tree in a container. The mold is
allowed to air dry for about 8 hours to harden the binder.
Advantages of investment casting include: (1) parts of great complexity and intricacy
can be cast; (2) close dimensional control—tolerances of 0.075 mm (0.003 in) are
possible; (3) good surface finish is possible; (4) the wax can usually be recovered for reuse;
and (5) additional machining is not normally required—this is a net shape process.
Because many steps are involved in this casting operation, it is a relatively expensive
process. Investment castings are normally small in size, although parts with complex
geometries weighing up to 75 lb have been successfully cast. All types of metals, including
steels, stainless steels, and other high temperature alloys, can be investment cast.
Examples of parts include complex machinery parts, blades, and other components for
turbine engines, jewelry, and dental fixtures. Shown in Figure 11.9 is a part illustrating the
intricate features possible with investment casting.

11.2.5 PLASTER-MOLD AND CERAMIC-MOLD CASTING
Plaster-mold casting is similar to sand casting except that the mold is made of plaster of
Paris (gypsum, CaSO4–2H2O) instead of sand. Additives such as talc and silica flour are
mixed with the plaster to control contraction and setting time, reduce cracking, and
increase strength. To make the mold, the plaster mixture combined with water is poured
over a plastic or metal pattern in a flask and allowed to set. Wood patterns are generally
unsatisfactory due to the extended contact with water in the plaster. The fluid consistency
permits the plaster mixture to readily flow around the pattern, capturing its details and
surface finish. Thus, the cast product in plaster molding is noted for these attributes.
Curing of the plaster mold is one of the disadvantages of this process, at least in high
production. The mold must set for about 20 minutes before the pattern is stripped. The
mold is then baked for several hours to remove moisture. Even with the baking, not all of
the moisture content is removed from the plaster. The dilemma faced by foundrymen is
that mold strength is lost when the plaster becomes too dehydrated, and yet moisture
content can cause casting defects in the product. A balance must be achieved between
these undesirable alternatives. Another disadvantage with the plaster mold is that it is not
permeable, thus limiting escape of gases from the mold cavity. This problem can be solved in

a number of ways: (1) evacuating air from the mold cavity before pouring; (2) aerating the
plaster slurry prior to mold making so that the resulting hard plaster contains finely
dispersed voids; and (3) using a special mold composition and treatment known as the
Antioch process. This process involves using about 50% sand mixed with the plaster,
heating the mold in an autoclave (an oven that uses superheated steam under pressure),
and then drying. The resulting mold has considerably greater permeability than a
conventional plaster mold.
Plaster molds cannot withstand the same high temperatures as sand molds. They
are therefore limited to the casting of lower-melting-point alloys, such as aluminum,
magnesium, and some copper-base alloys. Applications include metal molds for plastic
and rubber molding, pump and turbine impellers, and other parts of relatively intricate
geometry. Casting sizes range from about 20 g (less than 1 oz) to more than 100 kg (more
than 220 lb). Parts weighing less than about 10 kg (22 lb) are most common. Advantages of
plaster molding for these applications are good surface finish and dimensional accuracy and
the capability to make thin cross-sections in the casting.
Ceramic-mold casting is similar to plaster-mold casting, except that the mold is
made of refractory ceramic materials that can withstand higher temperatures than
plaster. Thus, ceramic molding can be used to cast steels, cast irons, and other hightemperature alloys. Its applications (relatively intricate parts) are similar to those of
plaster-mold casting except for the metals cast. Its advantages (good accuracy and finish)
are also similar.

PERMANENT-MOLD CASTING PROCESSES
The economic disadvantage of any of the expendable-mold processes is that a new mold
is required for every casting. In permanent-mold casting, the mold is reused many times.
In this section, we treat permanent-mold casting as the basic process in the group of
casting processes that all use reusable metal molds. Other members of the group include
die casting and centrifugal casting.

11.3.1 THE BASIC PERMANENT-MOLD PROCESS
Permanent-mold casting uses a metal mold constructed of two sections that are designed
for easy, precise opening and closing. These molds are commonly made of steel or cast iron.
The cavity, with gating system included, is machined into the two halves to provide accurate
dimensions and good surface finish. Metals commonly cast in permanent molds include
aluminum, magnesium, copper-base alloys, and cast iron. However, cast iron requires a
high pouring temperature, 1250 C to 1500 C (2282 F–2732 F), which takes a heavy toll on
mold life. The very high pouring temperatures of steel make permanent molds unsuitable
for this metal, unless the mold is made of refractory material.
Cores can be used in permanent molds to form interior surfaces in the cast product.
The cores can be made of metal, but either their shape must allow for removal from the
casting or they must be mechanically collapsible to permit removal. If withdrawal of a
metal core would be difficult or impossible, sand cores can be used, in which case the
casting process is often referred to as semipermanent-mold casting.
Steps in the basic permanent-mold casting process are described in Figure 11.10. In
preparation for casting, the mold is first preheated and one or more coatings are sprayed
on the cavity. Preheating facilitates metal flow through the gating system and into the
cavity. The coatings aid heat dissipation and lubricate the mold surfaces for easier
separation of the cast product. After pouring, as soon as the metal solidifies, the mold is
opened and the casting is removed. Unlike expendable molds, permanent molds do not
collapse, so the mold must be opened before appreciable cooling contraction occurs in
order to prevent cracks from developing in the casting.
Advantages of permanent-mold casting include good surface finish and close
dimensional control, as previously indicated. In addition, more rapid solidification caused
by the metal mold results in a finer grain structure, so stronger castings are produced. The
process is generally limited to metals of lower melting points. Other limitations include
simple part geometries compared to sand casting (because of the need to open the mold),
and the expense of the mold. Because mold cost is substantial, the process is best suited to
high-volume production and can be automated accordingly. Typical parts include automotive pistons, pump bodies, and certain castings for aircraft and missiles.

11.3.2 VARIATIONS OF PERMANENT-MOLD CASTING
Several casting processes are quite similar to the basic permanent-mold method. These
include slush casting, low-pressure casting, and vacuum permanent-mold casting.
Slush Casting Slush casting is a permanent-mold process in which a hollow casting is
formed by inverting the mold after partial freezing at the surface to drain out the liquid
metal in the center. Solidification begins at the mold walls because they are relatively cool,
and it progresses over time toward the middle of the casting (Section 10.3.1). Thickness of

the shell is controlled by the length of time allowed before draining. Slush casting is used to
make statues, lamp pedestals, and toys out of low-melting-point metals such as zinc and tin.
In these items, the exterior appearance is important, but the strength and interior geometry
of the casting are minor considerations.
Low-Pressure Casting In the basic permanent-mold casting process and in slush
casting, the flow of metal into the mold cavity is caused by gravity. In low-pressure
casting, the liquid metal is forced into the cavity under low pressure—approximately 0.1
MPa (14.5 lb/in2)—from beneath so that the flow is upward, as illustrated in Figure 11.11.
The advantage of this approach over traditional pouring is that clean molten metal from
the center of the ladle is introduced into the mold, rather than metal that has been
exposed to air. Gas porosity and oxidation defects are thereby minimized, and mechanical properties are improved.
Vacuum Permanent-Mold Casting Not to be confused with vacuum molding (Section
11.2.2), this process is a variation of low-pressure casting in which a vacuum is used to draw
the molten metal into the mold cavity. The general configuration of the vacuum permanentmold casting process is similar to the low-pressure casting operation. The difference is that
reduced air pressure from the vacuum in the mold is used to draw the liquid metal into the

e

cavity, rather than forcing it by positive air pressure from below. There are several benefits
of the vacuum technique relative to low-pressure casting: air porosity and related defects
are reduced, and greater strength is given to the cast product.

11.3.3 DIE CASTING
Die casting is a permanent-mold casting process in which the molten metal is injected into
the mold cavity under high pressure. Typical pressures are 7 to 350 MPa (1015–50,763 lb/
in2). The pressure is maintained during solidification, after which the mold is opened and
the part is removed. Molds in this casting operation are called dies; hence the name die
casting. The use of high pressure to force the metal into the die cavity is the most notable
feature that distinguishes this process from others in the permanent-mold category. The
reader can see the various forms of this process in the video clip on die casting.
VIDEO CLIP
Die Casting. This clip contains two segments: (1) die casting machines and (2) die casting
tooling.

Die casting operations are carried out in special die casting machines (Historical
Note 11.2), which are designed to hold and accurately close the two halves of the mold, and
keep them closed while the liquid metal is forced into the cavity. The general configuration
is shown in Figure 11.12. There are two main types of die casting machines: (1) hot-chamber
and (2) cold-chamber, differentiated by how the molten metal is injected into the cavity.
In hot-chamber machines, the metal is melted in a container attached to the machine,
and a piston is used to inject the liquid metal under high pressure into the die. Typical
injection pressures are 7 to 35 MPa (1015–5076 lb/in2). The casting cycle is summarized in
Figure 11.13. Production rates up to 500 parts per hour are not uncommon. Hot-chamber
die casting imposes a special hardship on the injection system because much of it is
submerged in the molten metal. The process is therefore limited in its applications to lowmelting-point metals that do not chemically attack the plunger and other mechanical
components. The metals include zinc, tin, lead, and sometimes magnesium.

Die casting machines

he modern die casting machine has its origins in the
printing industry and the need in the mid to late 1800s
to satisfy an increasingly literate population with a
growing appetite for reading. The linotype, invented and
developed by O. Mergenthaler in the late 1800s, is a
machine that produces printing type. It is a casting
machine because it casts a line of type characters out of
lead to be used in preparing printing plates. The name
linotype derives from the fact that the machine produces
a line of type characters during each cycle of operation.

The machine was first used successfully on a commercial
basis in New York City by The Tribune in 1886.
The linotype proved the feasibility of mechanized
casting machines. The first die casting machine was
patented by H. Doehler in 1905 (this machine is
displayed in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington,
DC). In 1907, E. Wagner developed the first die casting
machine to utilize the hot-chamber design. It was first
used during World War I to cast parts for binoculars and
gas masks.

In cold-chamber die casting machines, molten metal is poured into an unheated
chamber from an external melting container, and a piston is used to inject the metal under
high pressure into the die cavity. Injection pressures used in these machines are typically 14
to 140 MPa (2031–20,305 lb/in2). The production cycle is explained in Figure 11.14.
Compared to hot-chamber machines, cycle rates are not usually as fast because of the
need to ladle the liquid metal into the chamber from an external source. Nevertheless, this
casting process is a high production operation. Cold-chamber machines are typically used
for casting aluminum, brass, and magnesium alloys. Low-melting-point alloys (zinc, tin,
lead) can also be cast on cold-chamber machines, but the advantages of the hot-chamber
process usually favor its use on these metals.
Molds used in die casting operations are usually made of tool steel, mold steel, or
maraging steel. Tungsten and molybdenum with good refractory qualities are also being
used, especially in attempts to die cast steel and cast iron. Dies can be single-cavity or
multiple-cavity. Single-cavity dies are shown in Figures 11.13 and 11.14. Ejector pins are
required to remove the part from the die when it opens, as in our diagrams. These pins
push the part away from the mold surface so that it can be removed. Lubricants must also
be sprayed into the cavities to prevent sticking.
Because the die materials have no natural porosity and the molten metal rapidly
flows into the die during injection, venting holes and passageways must be built into the
dies at the parting line to evacuate the air and gases in the cavity. The vents are quite
small; yet they fill with metal during injection. This metal must later be trimmed from the
part. Also, formation of flash is common in die casting, in which the liquid metal under
high pressure squeezes into the small space between the die halves at the parting line or
into the clearances around the cores and ejector pins. This flash must be trimmed from
the casting, along with the sprue and gating system.
Advantages of die casting include (1) high production rates possible; (2) economical for
large production quantities; (3) close tolerances possible, on the order of 0.076 mm (0.003

in) for small parts; (4) good surface finish; (5) thin sections are possible, down to about 0.5 mm
(0.020 in); and (6) rapid cooling provides small grain size and good strength to the casting. The
limitation of this process, in addition to the metals cast, is the shape restriction. The part
geometry must allow for removal from the die cavity.

11.3.4 SQUEEZE CASTING AND SEMISOLID METAL CASTING
These are two processes that are often associated with die casting. Squeeze casting is a
combination ofcastingandforging(Section 19.3)inwhich amolten metalispoured intoa preheated lower die, and the upper die is closed to create the mold cavity after solidification
begins. This differs from the usualpermanent-mold casting processin which the die halves are
closed prior to pouring or injection. Owing to the hybrid nature of the process, it is also known
as liquid–metal forging. The pressure applied by the upper die in squeeze casting causes the
metal to completely fill the cavity, resulting in good surface finish and low shrinkage. The
required pressures are significantly less than in forging of a solid metal billet and much finer
surface detail can be imparted by the die than in forging. Squeeze casting can be used for both
ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, but aluminum and magnesium alloys are the most common
due to their lower melting temperatures. Automotive parts are a common application.
Semi-solid metal casting is a family of net-shape and near net-shape processes
performed on metal alloys at temperatures between the liquidus and solidus (Section
10.3.1). Thus the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals during casting, like a slurry;
it is in the mushy state. In order to flow properly, the mixture must consist of solid metal
globules in a liquid rather than the more typical dendritic solid shapes that form during
freezing of a molten metal. This is achieved by forcefully stirring the slurry to prevent
dendrite formation and instead encourage the spherical shapes, which in turn reduces
the viscosity of the work metal. Advantages of semisolid metal casting include the
following [16]: (1) complex part geometries, (2) thin walls in parts, (3) close tolerances,
(4) zero or low porosity, resulting in high strength of the casting.
There are several forms of semisolid metal casting. When applied to aluminum, the
terms thixocasting and rheocasting are used. The prefix in thixocasting is derived from
the word thixotropy, which refers to the decrease in viscosity of some fluid-like materials
when agitated. The prefix in rheocasting comes from rheology, the science that relates
deformation and flow of materials. In thixocasting, the starting work material is a precast billet that has a nondendritic microstructure; this is heated into the semisolid
temperature range and injected into a mold cavity using die casting equipment. In
rheocasting, a semisolid slurry is injected into the mold cavity by a die casting machine,
very much like conventional die casting. The difference is that the starting metal in
rheocasting is at a temperature between the solidus and liquidus rather than above the
liquidus. And the mushy mixture is agitated to prevent dendrite formation.
When applied to magnesium, the term is thixomolding, which utilizes equipment
similar to an injection-molding machine (Section 13.6.3). Magnesium alloy granules are
fed into a barrel and propelled forward by a rotating screw as they are heated into the
semisolid temperature range. The required globular form of the solid phase is accomplished by the mixing action of the rotating screw. The slurry is then injected into the
mold cavity by a linear forward movement of the screw.

11.3.5 CENTRIFUGAL CASTING
Centrifugal casting refers to several casting methods in which the mold is rotated at high
speed so that centrifugal force distributes the molten metal to the outer regions of the die
cavity. The group includes (1) true centrifugal casting, (2) semicentrifugal casting, and
(3) centrifuge casting.

FIGURE 11.15 Setup
for true centrifugal
casting.

True Centrifugal Casting In true centrifugal casting, molten metal is poured into a
rotating mold to produce a tubular part. Examples of parts made by this process include
pipes, tubes, bushings, and rings. One possible setup is illustrated in Figure 11.15. Molten
metal is poured into a horizontal rotating mold at one end. In some operations, mold
rotation commences after pouring has occurred rather than beforehand. The high-speed
rotation results in centrifugal forces that cause the metal to take the shape of the mold cavity.
Thus, the outside shape of the casting can be round, octagonal, hexagonal, and so on.
However, the inside shape of the casting is (theoretically) perfectly round, due to the radially
symmetric forces at work.
Orientation of the axis of mold rotation can be either horizontal or vertical, the
former being more common. Let us consider how fast the mold must rotate in horizontal
centrifugal casting for the process to work successfully. Centrifugal force is defined by
this physics equation:
F¼

mv2
R

ð11:2Þ

where F ¼ force, N (lb); m ¼ mass, kg (lbm); v ¼ velocity, m/s (ft/sec); and R ¼ inside
radius of the mold, m (ft). The force of gravity is its weight W ¼ mg, where W is given in kg
(lb), and g ¼ acceleration of gravity, 9.8 m/s2 (32.2 ft/sec2). The so-called G-factor GF is
the ratio of centrifugal force divided by weight:
GF ¼

where D ¼ inside diameter of the mold, m (ft). If the G-factor is too low in centrifugal
casting, the liquid metal will not remain forced against the mold wall during the upper
half of the circular path but will ‘‘rain’’ inside the cavity. Slipping occurs between the
molten metal and the mold wall, which means that the rotational speed of the metal is less
than that of the mold. On an empirical basis, values of GF ¼ 60 to 80 are found to be
appropriate for horizontal centrifugal casting [2], although this depends to some extent
on the metal being cast.

Rotation Speed in

Casting

A true centrifugal casting operation is to be performed horizontally to make copper tube
sections with OD ¼ 25 cm and ID ¼ 22.5 cm. What rotational speed is required if a Gfactor of 65 is used to cast the tubing?

In vertical centrifugal casting, the effect of gravity acting on the liquid metal causes
the casting wall to be thicker at the base than at the top. The inside profile of the casting
wall takes on a parabolic shape. The difference in inside radius between top and bottom is
related to speed of rotation as follows:

ð11:6Þ

where L ¼ vertical length of the casting, m (ft); Rt ¼ inside radius at the top of the casting,
m (ft); and Rb ¼ inside radius at the bottom of the casting, m (ft). Equation (11.6) can be
used to determine the required rotational speed for vertical centrifugal casting, given
specifications on the inside radii at top and bottom. One can see from the formula that for
Rt to equal Rb, the speed of rotation N would have to be infinite, which is impossible of
course. As a practical matter, part lengths made by vertical centrifugal casting are usually
no more than about twice their diameters. This is quite satisfactory for bushings and other
parts that have large diameters relatively to their lengths, especially if machining will be
used to accurately size the inside diameter.
Castings made by true centrifugal casting are characterized by high density, especially
in the outer regions of the part where F is greatest. Solidification shrinkage at the exterior of
the cast tube is not a factor, because the centrifugal force continually reallocates molten
metal toward the mold wall during freezing. Any impurities in the casting tend to be on the
inner wall and can be removed by machining if necessary.
Semicentrifugal Casting In this method, centrifugal force is used to produce solid
castings, as in Figure 11.16, rather than tubular parts. The rotation speed in semicentrifugal
casting is usually set so that G-factors of around 15 are obtained [2], and the molds are

designed with risers at the center to supply feed metal. Density of metal in the final casting is
greater in the outer sections than at the center of rotation. The process is often used on parts
in which the center of the casting is machined away, thus eliminating the portion of the
casting where the quality is lowest. Wheels and pulleys are examples of castings that can be
made by this process. Expendable molds are often used in semicentrifugal casting, as
suggested by our illustration of the process.
Centrifuge Casting In centrifuge casting, Figure 11.17, the mold is designed with part
cavities located away from the axis of rotation, so that the molten metal poured into the
mold is distributed to these cavities by centrifugal force. The process is used for smaller
parts, and radial symmetry of the part is not a requirement as it is for the other two
centrifugal casting methods.

11.4

FOUNDRY PRACTICE
In all casting processes, the metal must be heated to the molten state to be poured or
otherwise forced into the mold. Heating and melting are accomplished in a furnace. This
section covers the various types of furnaces used in foundries and the pouring practices
for delivering the molten metal from furnace to mold.

11.4.1 FURNACES
The types of furnaces most commonly used in foundries are (1) cupolas, (2) direct fuel-fired
furnaces, (3) crucible furnaces, (4) electric-arc furnaces, and (5) induction furnaces.
Selection of the most appropriate furnace type depends on factors such as the casting
alloy; its melting and pouring temperatures; capacity requirements of the furnace; costs of
investment, operation, and maintenance; and environmental pollution considerations.
Cupolas A cupola is a vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout near
its base. Cupolas are used only for melting cast irons, and although other furnaces are also
used, the largest tonnage of cast iron is melted in cupolas. General construction and
operating features of the cupola are illustrated in Figure 11.18. It consists of a large shell

of steel plate lined with refractory. The ‘‘charge,’’ consisting of iron, coke, flux, and
possible alloying elements, is loaded through a charging door located less than halfway up
the height of the cupola. The iron is usually a mixture of pig iron and scrap (including
risers, runners, and sprues left over from previous castings). Coke is the fuel used to heat
the furnace. Forced air is introduced through openings near the bottom of the shell for
combustion of the coke. The flux is a basic compound such as limestone that reacts with
coke ash and other impurities to form slag. The slag serves to cover the melt, protecting it
from reaction with the environment inside the cupola and reducing heat loss. As the
mixture is heated and melting of the iron occurs, the furnace is periodically tapped to
provide liquid metal for the pour.
Direct Fuel-Fired Furnaces A direct fuel-fired furnace contains a small open-hearth,
in which the metal charge is heated by fuel burners located on the side of the furnace. The
roof of the furnace assists the heating action by reflecting the flame down against the
charge. Typical fuel is natural gas, and the combustion products exit the furnace through a
stack. At the bottom of the hearth is a tap hole to release the molten metal. Direct fuelfired furnaces are generally used in casting for melting nonferrous metals such as copperbase alloys and aluminum.
Crucible Furnaces These furnaces melt the metal without direct contact with a burning
fuel mixture. For this reason, they are sometimes called indirect fuel-fired furnaces. Three
types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b) stationary, and

Three types of crucible furnaces: (a) lift-out crucible, (b) stationary pot, and (c) tilting-pot furnace.

(c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.19. They all utilize a container (the crucible) made out of
a suitable refractory material (e.g., a clay–graphite mixture) or high-temperature steel
alloy to hold the charge. In the lift-out crucible furnace, the crucible is placed in a furnace
and heated sufficiently to melt the metal charge. Oil, gas, or powdered coal are typical
fuels for these furnaces. When the metal is melted, the crucible is lifted out of the furnace
and used as a pouring ladle. The other two types, sometimes referred to as pot furnaces,
have the heating furnace and container as one integral unit. In the stationary pot furnace,
the furnace is stationary and the molten metal is ladled out of the container. In the tiltingpot furnace, the entire assembly can be tilted for pouring. Crucible furnaces are used for
nonferrous metals such as bronze, brass, and alloys of zinc and aluminum. Furnace
capacities are generally limited to several hundred pounds.
Electric-Arc Furnaces In this furnace type, the charge is melted by heat generated
from an electric arc. Various configurations are available, with two or three electrodes
(see Figure 6.9). Power consumption is high, but electric-arc furnaces can be designed for
high melting capacity (23,000–45,000 kg/hr or 25–50 tons/hr), and they are used primarily
for casting steel.
Induction Furnaces An induction furnace uses alternating current passing through a
coil to develop a magnetic field in the metal, and the resulting induced current causes
rapid heating and melting of the metal. Features of an induction furnace for foundry
operations are illustrated in Figure 11.20. The electromagnetic force field causes a mixing

action to occur in the liquid metal. Also, since the metal does not come in direct contact
with the heating elements, the environment in which melting takes place can be closely
controlled. All of this results in molten metals of high quality and purity, and induction
furnaces are used for nearly any casting alloy when these requirements are important.
Melting steel, cast iron, and aluminum alloys are common applications in foundry work.

11.4.2 POURING, CLEANING, AND HEAT TREATMENT
Moving the molten metal from the melting furnace to the mold is sometimes done using
crucibles. More often, the transfer is accomplished by ladles of various kinds. These
ladles receive the metal from the furnace and allow for convenient pouring into the
molds. Two common ladles are illustrated in Figure 11.21, one for handling large volumes
of molten metal using an overhead crane, and the other a ‘‘two-man ladle’’ for manually
moving and pouring smaller amounts.
One of the problems in pouring is that oxidized molten metal can be introduced
into the mold. Metal oxides reduce product quality, perhaps rendering the casting
defective, so measures are taken to minimize the entry of these oxides into the mold
during pouring. Filters are sometimes used to catch the oxides and other impurities as the
metal is poured from the spout, and fluxes are used to cover the molten metal to retard
oxidation. In addition, ladles have been devised to pour the liquid metal from the bottom,
since the top surface is where the oxides accumulate.
After the casting has solidified and been removed from the mold, a number of
additional steps are usually required. These operations include (1) trimming, (2)
removing the core, (3) surface cleaning, (4) inspection, (5) repair, if required, and (6)
heat treatment. Steps (1) through (5) are collectively referred to in foundry work as
‘‘cleaning.’’ The extent to which these additional operations are required varies with
casting processes and metals. When required, they are usually labor intensive and costly.
Trimming involves removal of sprues, runners, risers, parting-line flash, fins,
chaplets, and any other excess metal from the cast part. In the case of brittle casting
alloys and when the cross sections are relatively small, these appendages on the casting
can be broken off. Otherwise, hammering, shearing, hack-sawing, band-sawing, abrasive
wheel cutting, or various torch cutting methods are used.
If cores have been used to cast the part, they must be removed. Most cores are
chemically bonded or oil-bonded sand, and they often fall out of the casting as the binder
deteriorates. In some cases, they are removed by shaking the casting, either manually or
mechanically. In rare instances, cores are removed by chemically dissolving the bonding
agent used in the sand core. Solid cores must be hammered or pressed out.

Section 11.5/Casting Quality

249

Surface cleaning is most important in the case of sand casting. In many of the other
casting methods, especially the permanent-mold processes, this step can be avoided.
Surface cleaning involves removal of sand from the surface of the casting and otherwise
enhancing the appearance of the surface. Methods used to clean the surface include
tumbling, air-blasting with coarse sand grit or metal shot, wire brushing, buffing, and
chemical pickling (Chapter 28).
Defects are possible in casting, and inspection is needed to detect their presence.
We consider these quality issues in the following section.
Castings are often heat treated to enhance their properties, either for subsequent
processing operations such as machining or to bring out the desired properties for
application of the part.

11.5

CASTING QUALITY
There are numerous opportunities for things to go wrong in a casting operation, resulting
in quality defects in the cast product. In this section, we compile a list of the common
defects that occur in casting, and we indicate the inspection procedures to detect them.
Casting Defects Some defects are common to any and all casting processes. These
defects are illustrated in Figure 11.22 and briefly described in the following:
(a) Misruns, which are castings that solidify before completely filling the mold cavity.
Typical causes include (1) fluidity of the molten metal is insufficient, (2) pouring
temperature is too low, (3) pouring is done too slowly, and/or (4) cross-section of the
mold cavity is too thin.
(b) Cold Shuts, which occur when two portions of the metal flow together but there is a
lack of fusion between them due to premature freezing. Its causes are similar to those
of a misrun.
(c) Cold shots, which result from splattering during pouring, causing the formation of solid
globules of metal that become entrapped in the casting. Pouring procedures and gating
system designs that avoid splattering can prevent this defect.

common defects in

(e) microporosity, and
(f) hot tearing.

E1C11

Chapter 11/Metal Casting Processes

(d) Shrinkage cavity is a depression in the surface or an internal void in the casting,
caused by solidification shrinkage that restricts the amount of molten metal available
in the last region to freeze. It often occurs near the top of the casting, in which case it
is referred to as a ‘‘pipe.’’ See Figure 10.8(3). The problem can often be solved by
proper riser design.
(e) Microporosity consists of a network of small voids distributed throughout the casting
caused by localized solidification shrinkage of the final molten metal in the dendritic
structure. The defect is usually associated with alloys, because of the protracted
manner in which freezing occurs in these metals.
(f) Hot tearing, also called hot cracking, occurs when the casting is restrained from
contraction by an unyielding mold during the final stages of solidification or early
stages of cooling after solidification. The defect is manifested as a separation of
the metal (hence, the terms tearing and cracking) at a point of high tensile stress
caused by the metal’s inability to shrink naturally. In sand casting and other
expendable-mold processes, it is prevented by compounding the mold to be
collapsible. In permanent-mold processes, hot tearing is reduced by removing the
part from the mold immediately after solidification.
Some defects are related to the use of sand molds, and therefore they occur only in
sand castings. To a lesser degree, other expendable-mold processes are also susceptible to
these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in Figure 11.23 and
described here:
(a) Sand blow is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by release of
mold gases during pouring. It occurs at or below the casting surface near the top of
the casting. Low permeability, poor venting, and high moisture content of the sand
mold are the usual causes.
(b) Pinholes, also caused by release of gases during pouring, consist of many small gas
cavities formed at or slightly below the surface of the casting.
(c) Sand wash, which is an irregularity in the surface of the casting that results from
erosion of the sand mold during pouring, and the contour of the erosion is formed in
the surface of the final cast part.

Section 11.6/Metals for Casting

251

(d) Scabs are rough areas on the surface of the casting due to encrustations of sand and
metal. It is caused by portions of the mold surface flaking off during solidification and
becoming imbedded in the casting surface.
(e) Penetration refers to a surface defect that occurs when the fluidity of the liquid metal
is high, and it penetrates into the sand mold or sand core. Upon freezing, the casting
surface consists of a mixture of sand grains and metal. Harder packing of the sand
mold helps to alleviate this condition.
(f) Mold shift refers to a defect caused by a sidewise displacement of the mold cope
relative to the drag, the result of which is a step in the cast product at the parting line.
(g) Core shift is similar to mold shift, but it is the core that is displaced, and the
displacement is usually vertical. Core shift and mold shift are caused by buoyancy of
the molten metal (Section 11.1.3).
(h) Mold crack occurs when mold strength is insufficient, and a crack develops, into
which liquid metal can seep to form a ‘‘fin’’ on the final casting.
Inspection Methods Foundry inspection procedures include (1) visual inspection
to detect obvious defects such as misruns, cold shuts, and severe surface flaws;
(2) dimensional measurements to ensure that tolerances have been met; and
(3) metallurgical, chemical, physical, and other tests concerned with the inherent quality
of the cast metal [7]. Tests in category (3) include: (a) pressure testing—to locate leaks in
the casting; (b) radiographic methods, magnetic particle tests, the use of fluorescent
penetrants, and supersonic testing—to detect either surface or internal defects in the
casting; and (c) mechanical testing to determine properties such as tensile strength and
hardness. If defects are discovered but are not too serious, it is often possible to save the
casting by welding, grinding, or other salvage methods to which the customer has agreed.

11.6

METALS FOR CASTING
Most commercial castings are made of alloys rather than pure metals. Alloys are
generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting alloys
can be classified as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided into cast
iron and cast steel.
Ferrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron Cast iron is the most important of all casting alloys
(Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times that of all other
metals combined. There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray cast iron, (2) nodular iron,
(3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast irons (Section 6.2.4). Typical
pouring temperatures for cast iron are around 1400 C (2552 F), depending on
composition.
Ferrous Casting Alloys: Steel The mechanical properties of steel make it an
attractive engineering material (Section 6.2.3), and the capability to create complex
geometries makes casting an appealing process. However, great difficulties are faced
by the foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably
higher than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidification range for
low carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under 1540 C (2804 F). This means that
the pouring temperature required for steel is very high—about 1650 C (3002 F). At
these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so special
procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal from
air. Also, molten steel has relatively poor fluidity, and this limits the design of thin
sections in components cast out of steel.

Historical Note 11.3

I

Early cast iron products

n the early centuries of casting, bronze and brass were
preferred over cast iron as foundry metals. Iron was more
difficult to cast, due to its higher melting temperatures
and lack of knowledge about its metallurgy. Also, there
was little demand for cast iron products. This all changed
starting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
The art of sand-casting iron entered Europe from
China, where iron was cast in sand molds more than
2500 years ago. In 1550 the first cannons were cast from
iron in Europe. Cannon balls for these guns were made of
cast iron starting around 1568. Guns and their projectiles
created a large demand for cast iron. But these items
were for military rather than civilian use. Two cast iron
products that became significant to the general public in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the cast
iron stove and cast iron water pipe.
As unspectacular a product as it may seem today, the
cast iron stove brought comfort, health, and improved
living conditions to many people in Europe and America.
During the 1700s, the manufacture of cast iron stoves

was one of the largest and most profitable industries on
these two continents. The commercial success of stove
making was due to the large demand for the product and
the art and technology of casting iron that had been
developed to produce it.
Cast iron water pipe was another product that spurred
the growth of the iron casting industry. Until the advent
of cast iron pipes, a variety of methods had been tried to
supply water directly to homes and shops, including
hollow wooden pipes (which quickly rotted), lead pipes
(too expensive), and open trenches (susceptible to
pollution). Development of the iron casting process
provided the capability to fabricate water pipe sections at
relatively low cost. Cast iron water pipes were used in
France starting in 1664, and later in other parts of Europe.
By the early 1800s, cast iron pipe lines were being
widely installed in England for water and gas delivery.
The first significant water pipe installation in the United
States was in Philadelphia in 1817, using pipe imported
from England.

Several characteristics of steel castings make it worth the effort to solve these problems.
Tensile strength is higher than for most other casting metals, ranging upward from about 410
MPa (59,465 lb/in2) [9]. Steel castings have better toughness than most other casting alloys.
The properties of steel castings are isotropic; strength is virtually the same in all directions. By
contrast, mechanically formed parts (e.g., rolling, forging) exhibit directionality in their
properties. Depending on the requirements of the product, isotropic behavior of the material
may be desirable. Another advantage of steel castings is ease of welding. They can be readily
welded without significant loss of strength, to repair the casting, or to fabricate structures with
other steel components.
Nonferrous Casting Alloys Nonferrous casting metals include alloys of aluminum,
magnesium, copper, tin, zinc, nickel, and titanium (Section 6.3). Aluminum alloys are
generally considered to be very castable. The melting point of pure aluminum is 660 C
(1112 F), so pouring temperatures for aluminum casting alloys are low compared to cast iron
and steel. Their properties make them attractive for castings: light weight, wide range of
strength properties attainable through heat treatment, and ease of machining. Magnesium
alloys are the lightest of all casting metals. Other properties include corrosion resistance, as
well as high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios.
Copper alloys include bronze, brass, and aluminum bronze. Properties that make them
attractive include corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, and good bearing qualities. The
high cost of copper is a limitation on the use of its alloys. Applications include pipe fittings,
marine propeller blades, pump components, and ornamental jewelry.
Tin has the lowest melting point of the casting metals. Tin-based alloys are
generally easy to cast. They have good corrosion resistant but poor mechanical strength,
which limits their applications to pewter mugs and similar products not requiring high
strength. Zinc alloys are commonly used in die casting. Zinc has a low melting point and
good fluidity, making it highly castable. Its major weakness is low creep strength, so its
castings cannot be subjected to prolonged high stresses.

Section 11.7/Product Design Considerations

253

Nickel alloys have good hot strength and corrosion resistance, which make them
suited to high-temperature applications such as jet engine and rocket components, heat
shields, and similar components. Nickel alloys also have a high melting point and are not
easy to cast. Titanium alloys for casting are corrosion resistant and possess high strengthto-weight ratios. However, titanium has a high melting point, low fluidity, and a
propensity to oxidize at high temperatures. These properties make it and its alloys
difficult to cast.

11.7

PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
If casting is selected by the product designer as the primary manufacturing process for
a particular component, then certain guidelines should be followed to facilitate
production of the part and avoid many of the defects enumerated in Section 11.5.
Some of the important guidelines and considerations for casting are presented here.
å Geometric simplicity. Although casting is a process that can be used to produce
complex part geometries, simplifying the part design will improve its castability.
Avoiding unnecessary complexities simplifies mold making, reduces the need for
cores, and improves the strength of the casting.
å Corners. Sharp corners and angles should be avoided, because they are sources of
stress concentrations and may cause hot tearing and cracks in the casting. Generous
fillets should be designed on inside corners, and sharp edges should be blended.
å Section thicknesses. Section thicknesses should be uniform in order to avoid shrinkage cavities. Thicker sections create hot spots in the casting, because greater volume
requires more time for solidification and cooling. These are likely locations of
shrinkage cavities. Figure 11.24 illustrates the problem and offers some possible
solutions.
å Draft. Part sections that project into the mold should have a draft or taper, as
defined in Figure 11.25. In expendable-mold casting, the purpose of this draft is to
facilitate removal of the pattern from the mold. In permanent-mold casting, its
purpose is to aid in removal of the part from the mold. Similar tapers should be
allowed if solid cores are used in the casting process. The required draft need only be
about 1 for sand casting and 2 to 3 for permanent-mold processes.
å Use of cores. Minor changes in part design can reduce the need for coring, as shown
in Figure 11.25.
å Dimensional tolerances. There are significant differences in the dimensional accuracies that can be achieved in castings, depending on which process is used. Table 11.2
provides a compilation of typical part tolerances for various casting processes and
metals.
å Surface finish. Typical surface roughness achieved in sand casting is around 6 mm
(250 m-in). Similarly poor finishes are obtained in shell molding, while plaster-mold
and investment casting produce much better roughness values: 0.75 mm (30 m-in).

Among the permanent-mold processes, die casting is noted for good surface finishes
at around 1 mm (40 m-in).
å Machining allowances. Tolerances achievable in many casting processes are insufficient to meet functional needs in many applications. Sand casting is the most
prominent example of this deficiency. In these cases, portions of the casting must be
machined to the required dimensions. Almost all sand castings must be machined to
some extent in order for the part to be made functional. Therefore, additional
material, called the machining allowance, is left on the casting for machining those
surfaces where necessary. Typical machining allowances for sand castings range
between 1.5 mm and 3 mm (0.06 in and 0.12 in).

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced in
very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage bottles,
and window glass. Others, such as giant telescope lenses,
are made individually.
Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chapter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)
structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is shaped into
useful products are quite different from those used for the
other types. In glassworking, the principal starting material is
silica (SiO2); this is usually combined with other oxide
ceramics, which form glasses. The starting material is heated
to transform it from a hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is
then shaped into the desired geometry while in this highly
plastic or fluid condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.
The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking
consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is
accomplished by various processes, including casting, pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other containers),
and rolling (to make plate glass). A finishing step is
required for certain products.

12.1

RAW MATERIALS
PREPARATION AND
MELTING

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The sand must
be washed and classified. Washing removes impurities such
as clay and certain minerals that would cause undesirable
coloring of the glass. Classifying the sand means grouping
the grains according to size. The most desirable particle size
for glassmaking is in the range of 0.1 to 0.6 mm (0.004 to

0.025 in) [3]. The various other components, such as soda ash (source of Na2O), limestone
(source of CaO), aluminum oxide, potash (source of K2O), and other minerals are added in
the proper proportions to achieve the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in
batches, in amounts that are compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.
Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition to
preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the amount
of waste glass available and the specifications of the final composition, the proportion of
recycled glass may be up to 100%.
The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a charge, and the
procedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called charging the furnace. Glassmelting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1) pot furnaces—ceramic
pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the pot; (2) day
tanks—larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is done by burning
fuels above the charge; (3) continuous tank furnaces—long tank furnaces in which raw
materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the other end where molten glass
is drawn out for high production; and (4) electric furnaces of various designs for a wide
range of production rates.
Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around 1500 C to 1600 C
(2700 F to 2900 F). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This is the
time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and the molten glass to be
refined and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working. Molten glass is a viscous
liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature. Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the temperature at which the glass is tapped
from the furnace depends on the viscosity required for the subsequent process.

12.2

SHAPING PROCESSES IN GLASSWORKING
The major categories of glass products were identified in Section 7.4.2 as window glass,
containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass fibers, and optical glass. Despite the
variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these products can be
grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece ware, which includes
bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous processes for making flat
glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for laboratory ware and fluorescent
lights); and (3) fiber-making processes to produce fibers for insulation, fiberglass
composite materials, and fiber optics.

12.2.1 SHAPING OF PIECE WARE
The ancient methods of hand-working glass, such as glass blowing, were briefly described
in Historical Note 7.3. Handicraft methods are still employed today for making glassware
items of high value in small quantities. Most of the processes discussed in this section are

highly mechanized technologies for producing discrete pieces such as jars, bottles, and
light bulbs in high quantities.
Spinning Glass spinning is similar to centrifugal casting of metals, and is also known by
that name in glassworking. It is used to produce funnel-shaped components such as the
back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer monitors. The setup is
pictured in Figure 12.2. A gob of molten glass is dropped into a conical mold made of
steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes the glass to flow upward and
spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e., the front viewing screen) is later
assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low melting point.
Pressing This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,
bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively flat.
The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most
pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.
Blowing Several shaping sequences include blowing as one or more of the steps.
Instead of a manual operation, blowing is performed on highly automated equipment.
The two sequences we describe here are the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods.
As the name indicates, the press-and-blow method is a pressing operation followed
by a blowing operation, as portrayed in Figure 12.4. The process is suited to the
production of wide-mouth containers. A split mold is used in the blowing operation
for part removal.
The blow-and-blow method is used to produce smaller-mouthed bottles. The
sequence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations

are used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depending
on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.
Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate molds
are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production rates. Pressand-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.

Chapter 12/Glassworking

Casting If the molten glass is sufficiently fluid, it can be poured into a mold. Relatively
massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this method. These
pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and possible cracking owing
to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in the glass. After cooling and
solidifying, the piece must be finished by lapping and polishing. Casting is not much used
in glassworking except for these kinds of special jobs. Not only is cooling and cracking a
problem, but also molten glass is relatively viscous at normal working temperatures, and
does not flow through small orifices or into small sections as well as molten metals or
heated thermoplastics. Smaller lenses are usually made by pressing, discussed in the
preceding.

12.2.2 SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS
Here we describe two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube
stock. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of flat window glass or glass
tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They are modern
technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical Note 12.1.

Historical Note 12.1

G

Ancient methods of making flat glass [7]

lass windows have been used in buildings for many
centuries. The oldest process for making flat window
glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure
consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown on
a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made to stick to
the end of a ‘‘punty,’’ a metal rod used by glassblowers, and
then detached from the blowpipe; and (3) after reheating
the glass, the punty was rotated with sufficient speed for
centrifugal force to shape the open globe into a flat disk.
The disk, whose maximum possible size was only about
1 m (3 ft), was later cut into small panes for windows.

At the center of the disk, where the glass was attached
to the punty during the third step in the process, a lump
would tend to form that had the appearance of a crown.
The name ‘‘crown glass’’ was derived from this
resemblance. Lenses for spectacles were ground from
glass made by this method. Today, the name crown glass
is still used for certain types of optical and ophthalmic
glass, even though the ancient method has been replaced
by modern production technology.

Rolling of Flat Plate Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in
Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is squeezed
through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the sheet. The
rolling operation is usually set up so that the flat glass is moved directly into an annealing
furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished for parallelism and
smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7 The float
process for producing
sheet glass.

Float Process This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over other
methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no subsequent finishing.
In the float process, illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass flows directly from its melting
furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly fluid glass spreads evenly across
the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and smoothness. After moving into a
cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and travels through an annealing furnace, after
which it is cut to size.
Drawing of Glass Tubes Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process known as
the Danner process, illustrated in Figure 12.8. Molten glass flows around a rotating
hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn. The air
temperature and its volumetric flow rate, as well as the drawing velocity, determine the
diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross section. During hardening, the glass tube
is supported by a series of rollers extending about 30 m (100 ft) beyond the mandrel.
The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths. Tubular glass products include
laboratory glassware, fluorescent light tubes, and thermometers.

12.2.3 FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS
Glass fibers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to fiber optics communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass fiber products can be divided into two categories [6]:
(1) fibrous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air filtration, in which
the fibers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, continuous filaments suitable
for fiber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and fiber optics. Different production
methods are used for the two categories; we describe two methods in the following,
representing each of the product categories, respectively.

Drawing of continuous

Centrifugal Spraying In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass flows
into a rotating bowl with many small orifices around its periphery. Centrifugal force
causes the glass to flow through the holes to become a fibrous mass suitable for thermal
and acoustical insulation.
Drawing of Continuous Filaments In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9, continuous glass fibers of small diameter (the lower size limit is around 0.0025 mm [0.0001 in])
are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small orifices in a heated plate
made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes, each making one
fiber. The individual fibers are collected into a strand by reeling them onto a spool.
Before spooling, the fibers are coated with various chemicals to lubricate and protect
them. Drawing speeds of around 50 m/s (10,000 ft/min) or more are not unusual.

12.3 HEAT TREATMENT AND FINISHING
Heat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence. For
some products, additional finishing operations are performed.

12.3.1 HEAT TREATMENT
We discussed glass-ceramics in Section 7.4.3 This unique material is made by a special
heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrystalline ceramic.
Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples include annealing and
tempering.

Annealing Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after forming,
which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the treatment
therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalworking. Annealing
involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding it for a certain period to
eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly cooling the glass to suppress
stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to room temperature. Common
annealing temperatures are around 500 C (900 F). The length of time the product is
held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cooling rates during the cycle, depend
on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that the required annealing time varies with
the square of thickness.
Annealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called
lehrs, in which the products flow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors. Burners
are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experiences the required
heating and cooling cycle.
Tempered Glass and Related Products A beneficial internal stress pattern can be
developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as tempering, and the resulting
material is called tempered glass. As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering
increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a temperature
somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by
quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract
and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant. As the internal glass slowly
cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics,
glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses.
Accordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because of
the compressive stresses on its surfaces. Applications include windows for tall buildings,
all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.
When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small fragments
that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window glass. Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because of the danger
posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass is used; however, it
is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of a tough polymer sheet.
Should this laminated glass fracture, the glass splinters are retained by the polymer sheet
and the windshield remains relatively transparent.

12.3.2 FINISHING
Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These secondary
operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are produced by
drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and the surfaces
contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on soft glass. The
glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial applications. In pressing
and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is often required to remove the
seam marks from the container product.
In continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the continuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by first scoring the glass with
a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section along the score line.
Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr.
Decorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products.
These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting; chemical etching (with hydrofluoric acid, often in combination with other chemicals); and
coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to produce mirrors).

12.4 PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Glass possesses special properties that make it desirable in certain applications. The
following design recommendations are compiled from Bralla [1] and other sources.
å Glass is transparent and has certain optical properties that are unusual if not unique
among engineering materials. For applications requiring transparency, light transmittance, magnification, and similar optical properties, glass is likely to be the
material of choice. Certain polymers are transparent and may be competitive,
depending on design requirements.
å Glass is several times stronger in compression than in tension; components should be
designed so that they are subjected to compressive stresses, not tensile stresses.
å Ceramics, including glass, are brittle. Glass parts should not be used in applications
that involve impact loading or high stresses, which might cause fracture.
å Certain glass compositions have very low thermal expansion coefficients and are
therefore tolerant of thermal shock. These glasses can be selected for applications in
which this characteristic is important.
å Outside edges and corners on glass parts should have large radii or chamfers;
likewise, inside corners should have large radii. Both outside and inside corners
are potential points of stress concentration.
å Unlike parts made of traditional and new ceramics, threads may be included in the
design of glass parts; they are technically feasible with the press-and-blow shaping
processes. However, the threads should be coarse.

Product Design Considerations

Plastics can be shaped into a wide variety of products, such
as molded parts, extruded sections, films and sheets, insulation coatings on electrical wires, and fibers for textiles. In
addition, plastics are often the principal ingredient in other
materials, such as paints and varnishes; adhesives; and
various polymer matrix composites. In this chapter we consider the technologies by which these products are shaped,
postponing paints and varnishes, adhesives, and composites
until later chapters. Many plastic-shaping processes can be
adapted to rubbers (Chapter 14) and polymer matrix
composites (Chapter 15).
The commercial and technological importance of these
shapingprocessesderivesfrom the growing importanceofthe
materials being processed. Applications of plastics have
increased at a much faster rate than either metals or ceramics
during the last 50 years. Indeed, many parts previously made
of metals are today being made of plastics and plastic composites. The same is true of glass; plastic containers have been
largelysubstitutedforglassbottlesandjarsinproductpackaging. The total volume of polymers (plastics and rubbers) now
exceeds that of metals. We can identify several reasons why
the plastic-shaping processes are important:
å The variety of shaping processes, and the ease with
which polymers can be processed, allows an almost
unlimited variety of part geometries to be formed.
å Many plastic parts are formed by molding, which is a net
shape process. Further shaping is generally not needed.
å Although heating is usually required to form plastics,
less energy is required than for metals because the
processing temperatures are much lower.
å Because lower temperatures are used in processing,
handling of the product is simplified during production.
Because many plastic processing methods are one-step
operations (e.g., molding), the amount of product
handling required is substantially reduced compared
with metals.

å Finishing by painting or plating is not required (except in unusual circumstances) for
plastics.
As discussed in Chapter 8, the two types of plastics are thermoplastics and
thermosets. The difference is that thermosets undergo a curing process during heating
and shaping, which causes a permanent chemical change (cross-linking) in their molecular structure. Once they have been cured, they cannot be melted through reheating. By
contrast, thermoplastics do not cure, and their chemical structure remains basically
unchanged upon reheating even though they transform from solid to fluid. Of the two
types, thermoplastics are by far the more important type commercially, comprising more
than 80% of the total plastics tonnage.
Plastic-shaping processes can be classified as follows according to the resulting
product geometry: (1) continuous extruded products with constant cross section other
than sheets, films, and filaments; (2) continuous sheets and films; (3) continuous
filaments (fibers); (4) molded parts that are mostly solid; (5) hollow molded parts
with relatively thin walls; (6) discrete parts made of formed sheets and films; (7) castings;
and (8) foamed products. This chapter examines each of these categories. The most
important processes commercially are those associated with thermoplastics; the two
processes of greatest significance are extrusion and injection molding. A brief history of
plastic-shaping processes is presented in Historical Note 13.1.
Coverage of the plastic-shaping processes begins by examining the properties of
polymer melts, because nearly all of the thermoplastic shaping processes share the
common step of heating the plastic so that it flows.

Historical Note 13.1

E

Plastic shaping processes

quipment for shaping plastics evolved largely from
rubber processing technology. Noteworthy among the
early contributors was Edwin Chaffee, an American who
developed a two-roll steam-heated mill for mixing
additives into rubber around 1835 (Section 14.1.3).
He was also responsible for a similar device called a
calender, which consists of a series of heated rolls for
coating rubber onto cloth (Section 13.3). Both machines
are still used today for plastics as well as rubbers.
The first extruders, dating from around 1845 in
the United Kingdom, were ram-driven machines for
extruding rubber and coating rubber onto electrical wire.
The trouble with ram-type extruders is that they operate
in an intermittent fashion. An extruder that could operate
continuously, especially for wire and cable coating, was
highly desirable. Although several individuals worked
with varying degrees of success on a screw-type extruder
(Section 13.2.1), Mathew Gray in the United Kingdom is

13.1

credited with the invention; his patent is dated 1879.
As thermoplastics were subsequently developed, these
screw extruders, originally designed for rubber, were
adapted. An extrusion machine specifically designed for
thermoplastics was introduced in 1935.
Injection molding machines for plastics were
adaptations of equipment designed for metal die casting
(Historical Note 11.2). Around 1872, John Hyatt, an
important figure in the development of plastics
(Historical Note 8.1), patented a molding machine
specifically for plastics. It was a plunger-type machine
(Section 13.6.3). The injection molding machine in
its modern form was introduced in 1921, with
semiautomatic controls added in 1937. Ram-type
machines were the standard in the plastic molding
industry for many decades, until the superiority of the
reciprocating screw machine, developed by William
Willert in the United States in 1952, became obvious.

PROPERTIES OF POLYMER MELTS
To shape a thermoplastic polymer it must be heated so that it softens to the consistency of
a liquid. In this form, it is called a polymer melt. Polymer melts exhibit several unique
properties and characteristics, considered in this section.

FIGURE 13.1 Viscosity relationships for Newtonian
fluid and typical polymer melt.

Viscosity Because of its high molecular weight, a polymer melt is a thick fluid with high
viscosity. As we defined the term in Section 3.4, viscosity is a fluid property that relates the
shear stress experienced during flow of the fluid to the rate of shear. Viscosity is important
in polymer processing because most of the shaping methods involve flow of the polymer
melt through small channels or die openings. The flow rates are often large, thus leading to
high rates of shear; and the shear stresses increase with shear rate, so that significant
pressures are required to accomplish the processes.
Figure 13.1 shows viscosity as a function of shear rate for two types of fluids. For a
Newtonian fluid (which includes most simple fluids such as water and oil), viscosity is a
constant at a given temperature; it does not change with shear rate. The relationship
between shear stress and shear strain is proportional, with viscosity as the constant of
proportionality:
t ¼ h g_

or h ¼ t g_

ð13:1Þ

where t ¼ shear stress, Pa (lb/in2); h ¼ coefficient of shear viscosity, Ns/m2, or Pa-s (lb-sec/
in2); and g_ ¼ shear rate, 1/s (1/sec).
However, for a polymer melt, viscosity decreases with shear rate, indicating that the
fluid becomes thinner at higher rates of shear. This behavior is called pseudoplasticity and
can be modeled to a reasonable approximation by the expression
t ¼ kðg_ Þn

ð13:2Þ

where k ¼ a constant corresponding to the viscosity coefficient and n ¼ flow behavior
index.
For n ¼ 1, the equation reduces to the previous Eq. (13.1) for a Newtonian fluid,
and k becomes h. For a polymer melt, values of n are less than 1.
In addition to the effect of shear rate (fluid flow rate), viscosity of a polymer melt is
also affected by temperature. Like most fluids, the value decreases with increasing
temperature. This is shown in Figure 13.2 for several common polymers at a shear rate
of 103 s1, which is approximately the same as the rates encountered in injection molding
and high speed extrusion. Thus we see that the viscosity of a polymer melt decreases with
increasing values of shear rate and temperature. Equation (13.2) can be applied, except that
k depends on temperature as shown in Figure 13.2.
Viscoelasticity Another property possessed by polymer melts is viscoelasticity. We
discussed this property in the context of solid polymers in Section 3.5. However, liquid
polymers exhibit it also. A good example is die swell in extrusion, in which the hot plastic
expands when exiting the die opening. The phenomenon, illustrated in Figure 13.3, can be
explained by noting that the polymer was contained in a much larger cross section before
entering the narrow die channel. In effect, the extruded material ‘‘remembers’’ its former
shape and attempts to return to it after leaving the die orifice. More technically, the compressive

FIGURE 13.3 Die swell,

stresses acting on the material as it enters the small die opening do not relax immediately. When the
material subsequently exits the orifice and the restriction is removed, the unrelaxed stresses cause the
cross section to expand.
Die swell can be most easily measured for a circular cross section by means of the
swell ratio, defined as
Dx
ð13:3Þ
rs ¼
Dd
where rs ¼ swell ratio; Dx ¼ diameter of the extruded cross section, mm (in); and Dd ¼
diameter of the die orifice, mm (in).
The amount of die swell depends on the time the polymer melt spends in the die
channel. Increasing the time in the channel, by means of a longer channel, reduces die
swell.

13.2

EXTRUSION
Extrusion is one of the fundamental shaping processes, for metals and ceramics as well as
polymers. Extrusion is a compression process in which material is forced to flow through a
die orifice to provide long continuous product whose cross-sectional shape is determined by

E1C13

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

the shape of the orifice. As a polymer shaping process, it is widely used for thermoplastics
and elastomers (but rarely for thermosets) to mass produce items such as tubing, pipes, hose,
structural shapes (such as window and door molding), sheet and film, continuous filaments,
and coated electrical wire and cable. For these types of products, extrusion is carried out as a
continuous process; the extrudate (extruded product) is subsequently cut into desired
lengths. This section covers the basic extrusion process, and several subsequent sections
examine processes based on extrusion.

13.2.1 PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT
In polymer extrusion, feedstock in pellet or powder form is fed into an extrusion barrel
where it is heated and melted and forced to flow through a die opening by means of a
rotating screw, as illustrated in Figure 13.4. The two main components of the extruder are
the barrel and the screw. The die is not a component of the extruder; it is a special tool
that must be fabricated for the particular profile to be produced.
The internal diameter of the extruder barrel typically ranges from 25 to 150 mm (1.0
to 6.0 in). The barrel is long relative to its diameter, with L=D ratios usually between 10 and
30. The L=D ratio is reduced in Figure 13.4 for clarity of drawing. The higher ratios are used
for thermoplastic materials, whereas lower L=D values are for elastomers. A hopper
containing the feedstock is located at the end of the barrel opposite the die. The pellets are
fed by gravity onto the rotating screw whose turning moves the material along the barrel.
Electric heaters are used to initially melt the solid pellets; subsequent mixing and
mechanical working of the material generate additional heat, which maintains the melt.
In some cases, enough heat is supplied through the mixing and shearing action that external
heating is not required. Indeed, in some cases the barrel must be externally cooled to
prevent overheating of the polymer.
The material is conveyed through the barrel toward the die opening by the action of
the extruder screw, which rotates at about 60 rev/min. The screw serves several functions
and is divided into sections that correspond to these functions. The sections and functions
are the (1) feed section, in which the stock is moved from the hopper port and preheated;
(2) compression section, where the polymer is transformed into liquid consistency, air
entrapped amongst the pellets is extracted from the melt, and the material is compressed;
and (3) metering section, in which the melt is homogenized and sufficient pressure is
developed to pump it through the die opening.

Flight

The operation of the screw is determined by its geometry and speed of rotation.
Typical extruder screw geometry is depicted in Figure 13.5. The screw consists of spiraled
‘‘flights’’ (threads) with channels between them through which the polymer melt is moved. The
channel has a width wc and depth dc. As the screw rotates, the flights push the material
forward through the channel from the hopper end of the barrel toward the die. Although
not discernible in the diagram, the flight diameter is smaller than the barrel diameter D
by a very small clearance—around 0.05 mm (0.002 in). The function of the clearance is to
limit leakage of the melt backward to the trailing channel. The flight land has a width wf
and is made of hardened steel to resist wear as it turns and rubs against the inside of the
barrel. The screw has a pitch whose value is usually close to the diameter D. The flight
angle A is the helix angle of the screw and can be determined from the relation
tan A ¼

p
pD

ð13:4Þ

where p ¼ pitch of the screw1.
The increase in pressure applied to the polymer melt in the three sections of the
barrel is determined largely by the channel depth dc. In Figure 13.4, dc is relatively large
in the feed section to allow large amounts of granular polymer to be admitted into the
barrel. In the compression section, dc is gradually reduced, thus applying increased
pressure on the polymer as it melts. In the metering section, dc is small and pressure
reaches a maximum as flow is restrained by the screen pack and backer plate. The three
sections of the screw are shown as being about equal in length in Figure 13.4; this is
appropriate for a polymer that melts gradually, such as low-density polyethylene. For
other polymers, the optimal section lengths are different. For crystalline polymers such as
nylon, melting occurs rather abruptly at a specific melting point; therefore, a short
compression section is appropriate. Amorphous polymers such as polyvinylchloride melt
more slowly than LDPE, and the compression zone for these materials must take almost
the entire length of the screw. Although the optimal screw design for each material type is
different, it is common practice to use general-purpose screws. These designs represent a
compromise among the different materials, and they avoid the need to make frequent
screw changes, which result in costly equipment downtime.

Unfortunately, p is the natural symbol to use for two variables in this chapter. It represents the screw pitch
here and in several other chapters. We use the same symbol p for pressure later in the chapter.

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

Progress of the polymer along the barrel leads ultimately to the die zone. Before
reaching the die, the melt passes through a screen pack—a series of wire meshes
supported by a stiff plate (called a breaker plate) containing small axial holes. The
screen pack assembly functions to (1) filter contaminants and hard lumps from the melt;
(2) build pressure in the metering section; and (3) straighten the flow of the polymer melt
and remove its ‘‘memory’’ of the circular motion imposed by the screw. This last function is
concerned with the polymer’s viscoelastic property; if the flow were left unstraightened,
the polymer would play back its history of turning inside the extrusion chamber, tending
to twist and distort the extrudate.

13.2.2 ANALYSIS OF EXTRUSION
In this section, we develop mathematical models to describe, in a simplified way, several
aspects of polymer extrusion.
Melt Flow in the Extruder As the screw rotates inside the barrel, the polymer melt is
forced to move forward toward the die; the system operates much like an Archimedian
screw. The principal transport mechanism is drag flow, resulting from friction between
the viscous liquid and two opposing surfaces moving relative to each other: (1) the
stationary barrel and (2) the channel of the turning screw. The arrangement can be
likened to the fluid flow that occurs between a stationary plate and a moving plate
separated by a viscous liquid, as illustrated in Figure 3.17. Given that the moving plate has
a velocity v, it can be reasoned that the average velocity of the fluid is v=2, resulting in a
volume flow rate of
Qd ¼ 0:5 v d w

ð13:5Þ

where Qd ¼ volume drag flow rate, m /s (in /sec.); v ¼ velocity of the moving plate, m/s
(in/sec.); d ¼ distance separating the two plates, m (in); and w ¼ the width of the plates
perpendicular to velocity direction, m (in).
These parameters can be compared with those in the channel defined by the
rotating extrusion screw and the stationary barrel surface.

where D ¼ screw flight diameter, m (in); N ¼ screw rotational speed, rev/s; dc ¼ screw
channel depth, m (in); wc ¼ screw channel width, m (in); A ¼ flight angle; and wf ¼ flight
land width, m (in).
If we assume that the flight land width is negligibly small, then the last of these
equations reduces to
ð13:9Þ
wc ¼ pD tan A cos A ¼ pD sin A
Substituting Eqs. (13.6), (13.7), and (13.9) into Eq. (13.5), and using several trigonometric
identities, we get
Qd ¼ 0:5 p2 D2 N dc sin A cos A

ð13:10Þ

If no forces were present to resist the forward motion of the fluid, this equation
would provide a reasonable description of the melt flow rate inside the extruder.
However, compressing the polymer melt through the downstream die creates a back

pressure in the barrel that reduces the material moved by drag flow in Eq. (13.10). This
flow reduction, called the back pressure flow, depends on the screw dimensions, viscosity
of the polymer melt, and pressure gradient along the barrel. These dependencies can be
summarized in this equation [12]:
 
pDd3c sin2 A dp

where Qb ¼ back pressure flow, m3/s (in3/sec); h ¼ viscosity, N-s/m2 (lb-sec/in2); dp=dl ¼
the pressure gradient, MPa/m (lb/in2/in); and the other terms were previously defined.
The actual pressure gradient in the barrel is a function of the shape of the screw
over its length; a typical pressure profile is given in Figure 13.6. If we assume as an
approximation that the profile is a straight line, indicated by the dashed line in the figure,
then the pressure gradient becomes a constant p=L, and the previous equation reduces to
Qb ¼

ppDd3c sin2 A
12hL

ð13:12Þ

where p ¼ head pressure in the barrel, MPa (lb/in2); and L ¼ length of the barrel, m (in).
Recall that this back pressure flow is really not an actual flow by itself; it is a
reduction in the drag flow. Thus, we can compute the magnitude of the melt flow in an
extruder as the difference between the drag flow and back pressure flow:
Qx ¼ Qd  Qb
Qx ¼ 0:5 p2 D2 N dc sin A cos A 

ppDd3c sin2 A
12hL

ð13:13Þ

where Qx ¼ the resulting flow rate of polymer melt in the extruder.
Equation (13.13) assumes that there is minimal leak flow through the clearance
between flights and barrel. Leak flow of melt will be small compared with drag and back
pressure flow except in badly worn extruders.
Equation (13.13) contains many parameters, which can be divided into two types: (1)
design parameters, and (2) operating parameters. The design parameters are those that
define the geometry of the screw and barrel: diameter D, length L, channel depth dc, and
helix angle A. For a given extruder operation, these factors cannot be changed during the
process. The operating parameters are those that can be changed during the process to
affect output flow; they include rotational speed N, head pressure p, and melt viscosity h. Of
course, melt viscosity is controllable only to the extent to which temperature and shear rate
can be manipulated to affect this property. Let us see how the parameters play out their
roles in the following example.

unrestrained in the extruder, then the flow would equal drag flow Qd given by Eq.
(13.10). Given the design and operating parameters (D, A, N, etc.), this is the maximum
possible flow capacity of the extruder. Denote it as Qmax:
Qmax ¼ 0:5p2 D2 N dc sin A cos A

ð13:14Þ

On the other hand, if back pressure were so great as to cause zero flow, then back
pressure flow would equal drag flow; that is
Qx ¼ Qd  Qb ¼ 0; so Qd ¼ Qb
Using the expressions for Qd and Qb in Eq. (13.13), we can solve for p to determine what
this maximum head pressure pmax would have to be to cause no flow in the extruder:
pmax ¼

ð13:15Þ

The two values Qmax and pmax are points along the axes of a diagram known as the
extruder characteristic (or screw characteristic), as in Figure 13.7. It defines the
relationship between head pressure and flow rate in an extrusion machine with given
operating parameters.
With a die in the machine and the extrusion process underway, the actual values of Qx
and p will lie somewhere between the extreme values, the location determined by the
characteristics of the die. Flow rate through the die depends on the size and shape of the
opening and the pressure applied to force the melt through it. This can be expressed as
Qx ¼ K s p

where Qx ¼ flow rate, m3/s (in3/sec.); p ¼ head pressure, Pa (lb/in2); and Ks ¼ shape factor

For shapes other than round, the die shape factor is less than for a round of the same
cross-sectional area, meaning that greater pressure is required to achieve the same flow
rate.
The relationship between Qx and p in Eq. (13.16) is called the die characteristic. In
Figure 13.7, this is drawn as a straight line that intersects with the previous extruder
characteristic. The intersection point identifies the values of Qx and p that are known as
the operating point for the extrusion process.

13.2.3 DIE CONFIGURATIONS AND EXTRUDED PRODUCTS
The shape of the die orifice determines the cross-sectional shape of the extrudate. We can
enumerate the common die profiles and corresponding extruded shapes as follows: (1)
solid profiles; (2) hollow profiles, such as tubes; (3) wire and cable coating; (4) sheet and
film; and (5) filaments. The first three categories are covered in the present section.
Methods for producing sheet and film are examined in Section 13.3; and filament
production is discussed in Section 13.4. These latter shapes sometimes involve forming
processes other than extrusion.
Solid Profiles Solid profiles include regular shapes such as rounds and squares and
irregular cross sections such as structural shapes, door and window moldings, automobile
trim, and house siding. The side view cross section of a die for these solid shapes is illustrated
in Figure 13.8. Just beyond the end of the screw and before the die, the polymer melt passes
through the screen pack and breaker plate to straighten the flow lines. Then it flows into a
(usually) converging die entrance, the shape designed to maintain laminar flow and avoid
dead spots in the corners that would otherwise be present near the orifice. The melt then
flows through the die opening itself.
When the material exits the die, it is still soft. Polymers with high melt viscosities are
the best candidates for extrusion, because they hold shape better during cooling. Cooling is
accomplished by air blowing, water spray, or passing the extrudate through a water trough.

omitted for clarity.)

square extruded profile.

(a)

To compensate for die swell, the die opening is made long enough to remove some of the
memory in the polymer melt. In addition, the extrudate is often drawn (stretched) to offset
expansion from die swell.
For shapes other than round, the die opening is designed with a cross section that is
slightly different from the desired profile, so that the effect of die swell is to provide shape
correction. This correction is illustrated in Figure 13.9 for a square cross section. Because
different polymers exhibit varying degrees of die swell, the shape of the die profile
depends on the material to be extruded. Considerable skill and judgment are required by
the die designer for complex cross sections.
Hollow Profiles Extrusion of hollow profiles, such as tubes, pipes, hoses, and other
cross sections containing holes, requires a mandrel to form the hollow shape. A typical die
configuration is shown in Figure 13.10. The mandrel is held in place using a spider, seen in
Section A-A of the figure. The polymer melt flows around the legs supporting the
mandrel to reunite into a monolithic tube wall. The mandrel often includes an air channel
through which air is blown to maintain the hollow form of the extrudate during

FIGURE 13.10 Side view cross section of extrusion die for shaping hollow cross sections such as tubes and pipes;

cross section just prior to exiting the die; die swell causes an enlargement of the diameter. (Some die construction
details are simplified.)

hardening. Pipes and tubes are cooled using open water troughs or by pulling the soft
extrudate through a water-filled tank with sizing sleeves that limit the OD of the tube
while air pressure is maintained on the inside.
Wire and Cable Coating The coating of wire and cable for insulation is one of the most
important polymer extrusion processes. As shown in Figure 13.11 for wire coating, the
polymer melt is applied to the bare wire as it is pulled at high speed through a die. A slight
vacuum is drawn between the wire and the polymer to promote adhesion of the coating.
The taught wire provides rigidity during cooling, which is usually aided by passing the
coated wire through a water trough. The product is wound onto large spools at speeds of
up to 50 m/s (10,000 ft/min).

13.2.4 DEFECTS IN EXTRUSION
A number of defects can afflict extruded products. One of the worst is melt fracture, in
which the stresses acting on the melt immediately before and during its flow through the die
are so high as to cause failure, manifested in the form of a highly irregular surface on the
extrudate. As suggested by Figure 13.12, melt fracture can be caused by a sharp reduction at
the die entrance, causing turbulent flow that breaks up the melt. This contrasts with the
streamlined, laminar flow in the gradually converging die in Figure 13.8.

FIGURE 13.12 Melt

melt as it flows through
the die opening, which

called sharkskin and
(b) bambooing.

A more common defect in extrusion is sharkskin, in which the surface of the
product becomes roughened upon exiting the die. As the melt flows through the die
opening, friction at the interface results in a velocity profile across the cross section,
Figure 13.13. Tensile stresses develop at the surface as this material is stretched to keep
up with the faster moving center core. These stresses cause minor ruptures that roughen
the surface. If the velocity gradient becomes extreme, prominent marks occur on the
surface, giving it the appearance of a bamboo pole; hence, the name bambooing for this
more severe defect.

13.3

PRODUCTION OF SHEET AND FILM
Thermoplastic sheet and film are produced by a number of processes, most important of
which are two methods based on extrusion. The term sheet refers to stock with a
thickness ranging from 0.5 mm (0.020 in) to about 12.5 mm (0.5 in) and used for products
such as flat window glazing and stock for thermoforming (Section 13.9). Film refers to
thicknesses below 0.5 mm (0.020 in). Thin films are used for packaging (product
wrapping material, grocery bags, and garbage bags); thicker film applications include
covers and liners (pool covers and liners for irrigation ditches).
All of the processes covered in this section are continuous, high-production
operations. More than half of the films produced today are polyethylene, mostly lowdensity PE. The principal other materials are polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and
regenerated cellulose (cellophane). These are all thermoplastic polymers.
Slit-Die Extrusion of Sheet and Film Sheet and film of various thicknesses are produced
by conventional extrusion, using a narrow slit as the die opening. The slit may be up to 3 m
(10 ft) wide and as narrow as around 0.4 mm (0.015 in). One possible die configuration is
illustrated in Figure 13.14. The die includes a manifold that spreads the polymer melt
laterally before it flows through the slit (die orifice). One of the difficulties in this extrusion
method is uniformity of thickness throughout the width of the stock. This is caused by the
drastic shape change experienced by the polymer melt during its flow through the die and
also to temperature and pressure variations in the die. Usually, the edges of the film must be
trimmed because of thickening at the edges.
To achieve high production rates, an efficient method of cooling and collecting the
film must be integrated with the extrusion process. This is usually done by immediately
directing the extrudate into a quenching bath of water or onto chill rolls, as shown in
Figure 13.15. The chill roll method seems to be the more important commercially.
Contact with the cold rolls quickly quenches and solidifies the extrudate; in effect, the
extruder serves as a feeding device for the chill rolls that actually form the film. The
process is noted for very high production speeds—5 m/s (1000 ft/min). In addition, close
tolerances on film thickness can be achieved. Owing to the cooling method used in this
process, it is known as chill-roll extrusion.

FIGURE 13.14 One of
several die configurations

Blown-Film Extrusion Process This is the other widely used process for making thin
polyethylene film for packaging. It is a complex process, combining extrusion and
blowing to produce a tube of thin film; it is best explained with reference to the diagram
in Figure 13.16. The process begins with the extrusion of a tube that is immediately drawn
upward while still molten and simultaneously expanded in size by air inflated into it
through the die mandrel. A ‘‘frost line’’ marks the position along the upward moving bubble
where solidification of the polymer occurs. Air pressure in the bubble must be kept constant to
maintain uniform film thickness and tube diameter. The air is contained in the tube by pinch rolls
that squeeze the tube back together after it has cooled. Guide rolls and collapsing rolls are also
used to restrain the blown tube and direct it into the pinch rolls. The flat tube is then collected
onto a windup reel.
The effect of air inflation is to stretch the film in both directions as it cools from the
molten state. This results in isotropic strength properties, which is an advantage over
other processes in which the material is stretched primarily in one direction. Other
advantages include the ease with which extrusion rate and air pressure can be changed to
control stock width and gage. Comparing this process with slit-die extrusion, the blownfilm method produces stronger film (so that a thinner film can be used to package a
product), but thickness control and production rates are lower. The final blown film can

be left in tubular form (e.g., for garbage bags), or it can be subsequently cut at the edges to
provide two parallel thin films.
Calendering Calendering is a process for producing sheet and film stock out of rubber
(Section 14.1.4) or rubbery thermoplastics such as plasticized PVC. In the process, the
initial feedstock is passed through a series of rolls to work the material and reduce its
thickness to the desired gage. A typical setup is illustrated in Figure 13.17. The equipment
is expensive, but production rate is high; speeds approaching 2.5 m/s (500 ft/min) are
possible. Close control is required over roll temperatures, pressures, and rotational speed.
The process is noted for its good surface finish and high gage accuracy in the film. Plastic
products made by the calendering process include PVC floor covering, shower curtains,
vinyl table cloths, pool liners, and inflatable boats and toys.

13.4 FIBER AND FILAMENT PRODUCTION (SPINNING)
The most important application of polymer fibers and filaments is in textiles. Their use as
reinforcing materials in plastics (composites) is a growing application, but still small compared
with textiles. A fiber can be defined as a long, thin strand of material whose length is at least 100
times its cross-sectional dimension. A filament is a fiber of continuous length.
Fibers can be natural or synthetic. Synthetic fibers constitute about 75% of the
total fiber market today, polyester being the most important, followed by nylon,
acrylics, and rayon. Natural fibers are about 25% of the total produced, with cotton by
far the most important staple (wool production is significantly less than cotton).
The term spinning is a holdover from the methods used to draw and twist natural
fibers into yarn or thread. In the production of synthetic fibers, the term refers to the
process of extruding a polymer melt or solution through a spinneret (a die with multiple
small holes) to make filaments that are then drawn and wound onto a bobbin. There are
three principal variations in the spinning of synthetic fibers, depending on the polymer
being processed: (1) melt spinning, (2) dry spinning, and (3) wet spinning.
Melt spinning is used when the starting polymer can best be processed by heating to
the molten state and pumping through the spinneret, much in the manner of conventional
extrusion. A typical spinneret is 6 mm (0.25 in) thick and contains approximately 50 holes of
diameter 0.25 mm (0.010 in); the holes are countersunk, so that the resulting bore has an
L/D ratio of only 5/1 or less. The filaments that emanate from the die are drawn and
simultaneously air cooled before being collected together and spooled onto the bobbin,
as shown in Figure 13.18. Significant extension and thinning of the filaments occur while the
polymer is still molten, so that the final diameter wound onto the bobbin may be only 1/10

FIGURE 13.18 Melt

filaments.

of the extruded size. Melt spinning is used for polyesters and nylons; because these are the
most important synthetic fibers, melt spinning is the most important of the three processes
for synthetic fibers.
In dry spinning, the starting polymer is in solution and the solvent can be separated
by evaporation. The extrudate is pulled through a heated chamber that removes the
solvent; otherwise the sequence is similar to the previous. Fibers of cellulose acetate and
acrylic are produced by this process. In wet spinning, the polymer is also in solution—
only the solvent is nonvolatile. To separate the polymer, the extrudate must be passed
through a liquid chemical that coagulates or precipitates the polymer into coherent
strands that are then collected onto bobbins. This method is used to produce rayon
(regenerated cellulose fibers).
Filaments produced by any of the three processes are usually subjected to further cold
drawing to align the crystal structure along the direction of the filament axis. Extensions of 2
to 8 are typical [13]. This has the effect of significantly increasing the tensile strength of the
fibers. Drawing is accomplished by pulling the thread between two spools, where the winding
spool is driven at a faster speed than the unwinding spool.

13.5

COATING PROCESSES
Plastic (or rubber) coating involves application of a layer of the given polymer onto a substrate
material. Three categories are distinguished [6]: (1) wire and cable coating; (2) planar
coating, which involves the coating of a flat film; and (3) contour coating—the coating of a
three-dimensional object. We have already examined wire and cable coating (Section
13.2.3); it is basically an extrusion process. The other two categories are surveyed in the
following paragraphs. In addition, there is the technology of applying paints, varnishes,
lacquers, and other similar coatings (Section 28.6).
Planar coating is used to coat fabrics, paper, cardboard, and metal foil; these items
are major products for some plastics. The important polymers include polyethylene and
polypropylene, with lesser applications for nylon, PVC, and polyester. In most cases, the
coating is only 0.01 to 0.05 mm (0.0005–0.002 in) thick. The two major planar coating
techniques are illustrated in Figure 13.19. In the roll method, the polymer coating
material is squeezed against the substrate by means of opposing rolls. In the doctor blade
method, a sharp knife edge controls the amount of polymer melt that is coated onto the

FIGURE 13.19

Planar coating processes: (a) roll method, and (b) doctor-blade method.

substrate. In both cases, the coating material is supplied either by a slit-die extrusion
process or by calendering.
Contour coating of three-dimensional objects can be accomplished by dipping or
spraying. Dipping involves submersion of the object into a suitable bath of polymer melt
or solution, followed by cooling or drying. Spraying (such as spray painting) is an
alternative method for applying a polymer coating to a solid object.

13.6 INJECTION MOLDING
Injection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state and
forced to flow under high pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidifies. The molded part,
called a molding, is then removed from the cavity. The process produces discrete
components that are almost always net shape. The production cycle time is typically
in the range of 10 to 30 sec, although cycles of 1 min or longer are not uncommon for large
parts. Also, the mold may contain more than one cavity, so that multiple moldings are
produced each cycle. Many aspects of injection molding are illustrated in the video clip.
VIDEO CLIP
Plastic Injection Molding. This clip contains three segments: (1) plastic materials and
molding, (2) injection molding machines, and (3) injection molds.

Complex and intricate shapes are possible with injection molding. The challenge in
these cases is to fabricate a mold whose cavity is the same geometry as the part and that
also allows for part removal. Part size can range from about 50 g (2 oz) up to about 25 kg
(more than 50 lb), the upper limit represented by components such as refrigerator doors
and automobile bumpers. The mold determines the part shape and size and is the special
tooling in injection molding. For large, complex parts, the mold can cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars. For small parts, the mold can be built to contain multiple cavities,
also making the mold expensive. Thus, injection molding is economical only for large
production quantities.
Injection molding is the most widely used molding process for thermoplastics.
Some thermosets and elastomers are injection molded, with modifications in equipment
and operating parameters to allow for cross-linking of these materials. We discuss these
and other variations of injection molding in Section 13.6.6.

13.6.1 PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT
Equipment for injection molding evolved from metal die casting (Historical Note 13.1).
A large injection molding machine is shown in Figure 13.20. As illustrated in the
schematic in Figure 13.21, an injection molding machine consists of two principal
components: (1) the plastic injection unit and (2) the mold clamping unit. The injection
unit is much like an extruder. It consists of a barrel that is fed from one end by a hopper
containing a supply of plastic pellets. Inside the barrel is a screw whose operation
surpasses that of an extruder screw in the following respect: in addition to turning for
mixing and heating the polymer, it also acts as a ram that rapidly moves forward to inject
molten plastic into the mold. A nonreturn valve mounted near the tip of the screw
prevents the melt from flowing backward along the screw threads. Later in the molding
cycle the ram retracts to its former position. Because of its dual action, it is called a
reciprocating screw, a name that also identifies the machine type. Older injection

Cincinnati Milacron.)

molding machines used a simple ram (without screw flights), but the superiority of the
reciprocating screw design has led to its widespread adoption in today’s molding plants.
To summarize, the functions of the injection unit are to melt and homogenize the
polymer, and then inject it into the mold cavity.
The clamping unit is concerned with the operation of the mold. Its functions are to
(1) hold the two halves of the mold in proper alignment with each other; (2) keep the
mold closed during injection by applying a clamping force sufficient to resist the injection
force; and (3) open and close the mold at the appropriate times in the molding cycle. The
clamping unit consists of two platens, a fixed platen and a moveable platen, and a mechanism
for translating the latter. The mechanism is basically a power press that is operated by
hydraulic piston or mechanical toggle devices of various types. Clamping forces of several
thousand tons are available on large machines.
The cycle for injection molding of a thermoplastic polymer proceeds in the
following sequence, illustrated in Figure 13.22. Let us pick up the action with the
mold open and the machine ready to start a new molding: (1) The mold is closed and
clamped. (2) A shot of melt, which has been brought to the right temperature and
viscosity by heating and the mechanical working of the screw, is injected under high pressure
into the mold cavity. The plastic cools and begins to solidify when it encounters the cold
surface of the mold. Ram pressure is maintained to pack additional melt into the cavity to

compensate for contraction during cooling. (3) The screw is rotated and retracted with the
nonreturn valve open to permit fresh polymer to flow into the forward portion of the
barrel. Meanwhile, the polymer in the mold has completely solidified. (4) The mold is
opened, and the part is ejected and removed.

13.6.2 THE MOLD
The mold is the special tool in injection molding; it is custom designed and fabricated for
the given part to be produced. When the production run for that part is finished, the mold
is replaced with a new mold for the next part. In this section we examine several types of
mold for injection molding.
Two-Plate Mold The conventional two-plate mold, illustrated in Figure 13.23, consists
of two halves fastened to the two platens of the molding machine’s clamping unit. When
the clamping unit is opened, the two mold halves open, as shown in (b). The most obvious
feature of the mold is the cavity, which is usually formed by removing metal from the
mating surfaces of the two halves. Molds can contain a single cavity or multiple cavities to
produce more than one part in a single shot. The figure shows a mold with two cavities.
The parting surfaces (or parting line in a cross-sectional view of the mold) are where the
mold opens to remove the part(s).
In addition to the cavity, other features of the mold serve indispensable functions
during the molding cycle. A mold must have a distribution channel through which the
polymer melt flows from the nozzle of the injection barrel into the mold cavity. The
distribution channel consists of (1) a sprue, which leads from the nozzle into the mold; (2)
runners, which lead from the sprue to the cavity (or cavities); and (3) gates that constrict

cavities to produce two cup-shaped parts (cross section shown) with each injection shot.

the flow of plastic into the cavity. The constriction increases the shear rate, thereby
reducing the viscosity of the polymer melt. There are one or more gates for each cavity in
the mold.
An ejection system is needed to eject the molded part from the cavity at the end of
the molding cycle. Ejector pins built into the moving half of the mold usually accomplish
this function. The cavity is divided between the two mold halves in such a way that the
natural shrinkage of the molding causes the part to stick to the moving half. When the
mold opens, the ejector pins push the part out of the mold cavity.
A cooling system is required for the mold. This consists of an external pump
connected to passageways in the mold, through which water is circulated to remove
heat from the hot plastic. Air must be evacuated from the mold cavity as the polymer rushes
in. Much of the air passes through the small ejector pin clearances in the mold. In addition,
narrow air vents are often machined into the parting surface; only about 0.03 mm (0.001 in)
deep and 12 to 25 mm (0.5 to 1.0 in) wide, these channels permit air to escape to the outside
but are too small for the viscous polymer melt to flow through.
To summarize, a mold consists of (1) one or more cavities that determine part
geometry, (2) distribution channels through which the polymer melt flows to the cavities,
(3) an ejection system for part removal, (4) a cooling system, and (5) vents to permit
evacuation of air from the cavities.
Other Mold Types The two-plate mold is the most common mold in injection molding.
An alternative is a three-plate mold, shown in Figure 13.24, for the same part geometry as
before. There are advantages to this mold design. First, the flow of molten plastic is
through a gate located at the base of the cup-shaped part, rather than at the side. This
allows more even distribution of melt into the sides of the cup. In the side gate design in
the two-plate mold of Figure 13.23, the plastic must flow around the core and join on the
opposite side, possibly creating a weakness at the weld line. Second, the three-plate mold
allows more automatic operation of the molding machine. As the mold opens, it divides
into three plates with two openings between them. This action separates the runner from
the parts, which drop by gravity into containers beneath the mold.

The sprue and runner in a conventional two- or three-plate mold represent waste
material. In many instances they can be ground and reused; however, in some cases the
product must be made of ‘‘virgin’’ plastic (plastic that has not been previously molded). The
hot-runner mold eliminates the solidification of the sprue and runner by locating heaters
around the corresponding runner channels. Although the plastic in the mold cavity
solidifies, the material in the sprue and runner channels remains molten, ready to be
injected into the cavity in the next cycle.

13.6.3 INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES
Injection molding machines differ in both injection unit and clamping unit. This section
discusses the important types of machines available today. The name of the injection
molding machine is generally based on the type of injection unit used.
Injection Units Two types of injection units are widely used today. The reciprocatingscrew machine (Section 13.6.1, Figures 13.21 and 13.22) is the most common. This design
uses the same barrel for melting and injection of plastic. The alternative unit involves the
use of separate barrels for plasticizing and injecting the polymer, as shown in Figure 13.25
(a). This type is called a screw-preplasticizer machine or two-stage machine. Plastic
pellets are fed from a hopper into the first stage, which uses a screw to drive the polymer
forward and melt it. This barrel feeds a second barrel, which uses a plunger to inject the
melt into the mold. Older machines used one plunger-driven barrel to melt and inject the
plastic. These machines are referred to as plunger-type injection molding machines
(Figure 13.25(b)).
Clamping Units Clamping designs are of three types [11]: toggle, hydraulic, and hydromechanical. Toggle clamps include various designs, one of which is illustrated in Figure
13.26(a). An actuator moves the crosshead forward, extending the toggle links to push the
moving platen toward a closed position. At the beginning of the movement, mechanical
advantage is low and speed is high; but near the end of the stroke, the reverse is true. Thus,
toggle clamps provide both high speed and high force at different points in the cycle when
they are desirable. They are actuated either by hydraulic cylinders or ball screws driven by
electric motors. Toggle-clamp units seem most suited to relatively low tonnage machines.

Hydraulic clamps, shown in Figure 13.26(b), are used on higher-tonnage injection molding
machines, typically in the range 1300 to 8900 kN (150 to 1000 tons). These units are also
more flexible than toggle clamps in terms of setting the tonnage at given positions during
the stroke. Hydromechanical clamps are designed for large tonnages, usually above 8900
kN (1000 tons). They operate by (1) using hydraulic cylinders to rapidly move the mold
toward closing position, (2) locking the position by mechanical means, and (3) using highpressure hydraulic cylinders to finally close the mold and build tonnage.

13.6.4 SHRINKAGE AND DEFECTS IN INJECTION MOLDING
Polymers have high thermal expansion coefficients, and significant shrinkage can occur
during cooling of the plastic in the mold. Contraction of crystalline plastics tends to be
greater than for amorphous polymers. Shrinkage is usually expressed as the reduction in
linear size that occurs during cooling to room temperature from the molding temperature
for the given polymer. Appropriate units are therefore mm/mm (in/in) of the dimension
under consideration. Typical values for selected polymers are given in Table 13.1.
Fillers in the plastic tend to reduce shrinkage. In commercial molding practice,
shrinkage values for the specific molding compound should be obtained from the
producer before making the mold. To compensate for shrinkage, the dimensions of
the mold cavity must be made larger than the specified part dimensions. The following
formula can be used [14]:
Dc ¼ Dp þ Dp S þ Dp S2

ð13:19Þ

where Dc ¼ dimension of cavity, mm (in); Dp ¼ molded part dimension, mm (in), and S ¼
shrinkage values obtained from Table 13.1.
The third term on the right-hand side corrects for shrinkage that occurs in the
shrinkage.

Example 13.3
Shrinkage in
Injection Molding

The nominal length of a part made of polyethylene is to be 80 mm. Determine the
corresponding dimension of the mold cavity that will compensate for shrinkage.
Solution: From Table 13.1, the shrinkage for polyethylene is S ¼ 0.025. Using Eq. (13.19),
the mold cavity diameter should be:
Dc ¼ 80:0 þ 80:0ð0:025Þ þ 80:0ð0:025Þ2
¼ 80:0 þ 2:0 þ 0:05 ¼ 82:05 mm

n

Because of differences in shrinkage among plastics, mold dimensions must be
determined for the particular polymer to be molded. The same mold will produce
different part sizes for different polymer types.
Values in Table 13.1 represent a gross simplification of the shrinkage issue. In reality,
shrinkage is affected by a number of factors, any of which can alter the amount of
contraction experienced by a given polymer. The most important factors are injection
pressure, compaction time, molding temperature, and part thickness. As injection pressure
is increased, forcing more material into the mold cavity, shrinkage is reduced. Increasing
compaction time has a similar effect, assuming the polymer in the gate does not solidify and
seal off the cavity; maintaining pressure forces more material into the cavity while
shrinkage is taking place. Net shrinkage is thereby reduced.
Molding temperature refers to the temperature of the polymer in the cylinder
immediately before injection. One might expect that a higher polymer temperature
would increase shrinkage, on the reasoning that the difference between molding and

room temperatures is greater. However, shrinkage is actually lower at higher molding
temperatures. The explanation is that higher temperatures significantly lower the
viscosity of the polymer melt, allowing more material to be packed into the mold;
the effect is the same as higher injection pressures. Thus, the effect on viscosity more than
compensates for the larger temperature difference.
Finally, thicker parts show greater shrinkage. A molding solidifies from the outside;
the polymer in contact with the mold surface forms a skin that grows toward the center
of the part. At some point during solidification, the gate solidifies, isolating the material
in the cavity from the runner system and compaction pressure. When this happens, the
molten polymer inside the skin accounts for most of the remaining shrinkage that occurs
in the part. A thicker part section experiences greater shrinkage because it contains a
higher proportion of molten material.
In addition to the shrinkage issue, other things can also go wrong. Here are some of
the common defects in injection molded parts:
å Short shots. As in casting, a short shot is a molding that has solidified before
completely filling the cavity. The defect can be corrected by increasing temperature
and/or pressure. The defect may also result from use of a machine with insufficient
shot capacity, in which case a larger machine is needed.
å Flashing. Flashing occurs when the polymer melt is squeezed into the parting
surface between mold plates; it can also occur around ejection pins. The defect is
usually caused by (1) vents and clearances in the mold that are too large; (2) injection
pressure too high compared with clamping force; (3) melt temperature too high; or
(4) excessive shot size.
å Sink marks and voids. These are defects usually related to thick molded sections. A
sink mark occurs when the outer surface on the molding solidifies, but contraction of
the internal material causes the skin to be depressed below its intended profile. A void
is caused by the same basic phenomenon; however, the surface material retains its form
and the shrinkage manifests itself as an internal void because of high tensile stresses on
the still-molten polymer. These defects can be addressed by increasing the packing
pressure after injection. A better solution is to design the part to have uniform section
thicknesses and use thinner sections.
å Weld lines. Weld lines occur when polymer melt flows around a core or other convex
detail in the mold cavity and meets from opposite directions; the boundary thus formed
is called a weld line, and it may have mechanical properties that are inferior to those in
the rest of the part. Higher melt temperatures, higher injection pressures, alternative
gating locations on the part, and better venting are ways of dealing with this defect.

13.6.5 OTHER INJECTION MOLDING PROCESSES
The vast majority of injection molding applications involve thermoplastics. Several
variants of the process are described in this section.
Thermoplastic Foam Injection Molding Plastic foams have a variety of applications,
and we discuss these materials and their processing in Section 13.11. One of the processes,
sometimes called structural foam molding, is appropriate to discuss here because it is
injection molding. It involves the molding of thermoplastic parts that possess a dense
outer skin surrounding a lightweight foam center. Such parts have high stiffness-toweight ratios suitable for structural applications.
A structural foam part can be produced either by introducing a gas into the molten
plastic in the injection unit or by mixing a gas-producing ingredient with the starting pellets.
During injection, an insufficient amount of melt is forced into the mold cavity, where it

E1C13

Page 294

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

expands (foams) to fill the mold. The foam cells in contact with the cold mold surface
collapse to form a dense skin, while the material in the core retains its cellular structure.
Items made of structural foam include electronic cases, business machine housings,
furniture components, and washing machine tanks. Advantages cited for structural
foam molding include lower injection pressures and clamping forces, and thus the capability
to produce large components, as suggested by the preceding list. A disadvantage of the
process is that the resulting part surfaces tend to be rough, with occasional voids. If good
surface finish is needed for the application, then additional processing is required, such as
sanding, painting, and adhesion of a veneer.
Multi-Injection Molding Processes Unusual effects can be achieved by multiple
injection of different polymers to mold a part. The polymers are injected either
simultaneously or sequentially, and there may be more than one mold cavity involved.
Several processes fall under this heading, all characterized by two or more injection
units—thus, the equipment for these processes is expensive.
Sandwich molding involves injection of two separate polymers—one is the outer skin
of the part and the other is the inner core, which is typically a polymer foam. A specially
designed nozzle controls the flow sequence of the two polymers into the mold. The sequence
is designed so that the core polymer is completely surrounded by the skin material inside the
mold cavity. The final structure is similar to that of a structural foam molding. However,
the molding possesses a smooth surface, thus overcoming one of the major shortcomings of
the previous process. In addition, it consists of two distinct plastics, each with its own
characteristics suited to the application.
Another multi-injection molding process involves sequential injection of two
polymers into a two-position mold. With the mold in the first position, the first polymer
is injected into the cavity. Then the mold opens to the second position, and the second
melt is injected into the enlarged cavity. The resulting part consists of two integrally
connected plastics. Bi-injection molding is used to combine plastics of two different
colors (e.g., automobile tail light covers) or to achieve different properties in different
sections of the same part.
Injection Molding of Thermosets Injection molding is used for thermosetting (TS)
plastics, with certain modifications in equipment and operating procedure to allow for
cross-linking. The machines for thermoset injection molding are similar to those used for
thermoplastics. They use a reciprocating-screw injection unit, but the barrel length is
shorter to avoid premature curing and solidification of the TS polymer. For the same
reason, temperatures in the barrel are kept at relatively low levels, usually 50 C to 125 C
(120 F to 260 F), depending on the polymer. The plastic, usually in the form of pellets or
granules, is fed into the barrel through a hopper. Plasticizing occurs by the action of the
rotating screw as the material is moved forward toward the nozzle. When sufficient melt has
accumulated ahead of the screw, it is injected into a mold that is heated to 150 C to 230 C
(300 F to 450 F), where cross-linking occurs to harden the plastic. The mold is then opened,
and the part is ejected and removed. Molding cycle times typically range from 20 sec to 2
min, depending on polymer type and part size.
Curing is the most time-consuming step in the cycle. In many cases, the part can be
removed from the mold before curing is completed, so that final hardening occurs because
of retained heat within a minute or two after removal. An alternative approach is to use a
multiple-mold machine, in which two or more molds are attached to an indexing head
served by a single injection unit.
The principal thermosets for injection molding are phenolics, unsaturated polyesters,
melamines, epoxies, and urea-formaldehyde. Elastomers are also injected molded (Section
14.1.4). More than 50% of the phenolic moldings currently produced in the United States
are made by this process [11], representing a shift away from compression and transfer

molding, the traditional processes used for thermosets (Section 13.7). Most of the TS
molding materials contain large proportions of fillers (up to 70% by weight), including glass
fibers, clay, wood fibers, and carbon black. In effect, these are composite materials that are
being injected molded.
Reaction Injection Molding Reaction injection molding (RIM) involves the mixing of
two highly reactive liquid ingredients and immediately injecting the mixture into a mold
cavity, where chemical reactions leading to solidification occur. The two ingredients form
the components used in catalyst-activated or mixing-activated thermoset systems (Section
8.3.1). Urethanes, epoxies, and urea-formaldehyde are examples of these systems. RIM was
developed with polyurethane to produce large automotive components such as bumpers,
spoilers, and fenders. These kinds of parts still constitute the major application of the
process. RIM-molded polyurethane parts typically possess a foam internal structure
surrounded by a dense outer skin.
As shown in Figure 13.27, liquid ingredients are pumped in precisely measured
amounts from separate holding tanks into a mixing head. The ingredients are rapidly
mixed and then injected into the mold cavity at relatively low pressure where polymerization and curing occur. A typical cycle time is around 2 min. For relatively large cavities
the molds for RIM are much less costly than corresponding molds for conventional
injection molding. This is because of the low clamping forces required in RIM and the
opportunity to use lightweight components in the molds. Other advantages of RIM
include (1) low energy is required in the process; (2) equipment costs are less than
injection molding; (3) a variety of chemical systems are available that enable specific
properties to be obtained in the molded product; and (4) the production equipment is
reliable, and the chemical systems and machine relationships are well understood [17].

13.7

COMPRESSION AND TRANSFER MOLDING
Discussed in this section are two molding techniques widely used for thermosetting
polymers and elastomers. For thermoplastics, these techniques cannot match the efficiency of injection molding, except for very special applications.

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

13.7.1 COMPRESSION MOLDING
Compression molding is an old and widely used molding process for thermosetting
plastics. Its applications also include rubber tires and various polymer matrix composite
parts. The process, illustrated in Figure 13.28 for a TS plastic, consists of (1) loading a
precise amount of molding compound, called the charge, into the bottom half of a heated
mold; (2) bringing the mold halves together to compress the charge, forcing it to flow and
conform to the shape of the cavity; (3) heating the charge by means of the hot mold to
polymerize and cure the material into a solidified part; and (4) opening the mold halves
and removing the part from the cavity.
The initial charge of molding compound can be any of several forms, including
powders or pellets, liquid, or preform. The amount of polymer must be precisely controlled
to obtain repeatable consistency in the molded product. It has become common practice to
preheat the charge before its placement into the mold; this softens the polymer and
shortens the production cycle time. Preheating methods include infrared heaters, convection heating in an oven, and use of a heated rotating screw in a barrel. The latter technique
(borrowed from injection molding) is also used to meter the amount of the charge.
Compression molding presses are oriented vertically and contain two platens to
which the mold halves are fastened. The presses involve either of two types of actuation:
(1) upstroke of the bottom platen or (2) downstroke of the top platen, the former being
the more common machine configuration. They are generally powered by a hydraulic
cylinder that can be designed to provide clamping capacities up to several hundred tons.
Molds for compression molding are generally simpler than their injection mold
counterparts. There is no sprue and runner system in a compression mold, and the process
itself is generally limited to simpler part geometries because of the lower flow capabilities
of the starting thermosetting materials. However, provision must be made for heating the
mold, usually accomplished by electric resistance heating, steam, or hot oil circulation.
Compression molds can be classified as hand molds, used for trial runs; semiautomatic,
in which the press follows a programmed cycle but the operator manually loads and
unloads the press; and automatic, which operate under a fully automatic press cycle
(including automatic loading and unloading).

FIGURE 13.28 Compression molding for thermosetting plastics: (1) charge is loaded; (2) and (3) charge is compressed
and cured; and (4) part is ejected and removed (some details omitted).

297

Materials for compression molding include phenolics, melamine, urea-formaldehyde,
epoxies, urethanes, and elastomers. Typical moldings include electric plugs and sockets,
pot handles, and dinnerware plates. Advantages of compression molding in these
applications include (1) molds that are simpler and less expensive, (2) less scrap, and (3)
low residual stresses in the molded parts. A typical disadvantage is longer cycle times
and therefore lower production rates than injection molding.

13.7.2 TRANSFER MOLDING
In this process, a thermosetting charge is loaded into a chamber immediately ahead of the
mold cavity, where it is heated; pressure is then applied to force the softened polymer to
flow into the heated mold where curing occurs. There are two variants of the process,
illustrated in Figure 13.29: (a) pot transfer molding, in which the charge is injected from a

FIGURE 13.29 (a) Pot transfer molding, and (b) plunger transfer molding. Cycle in both processes is: (1) charge is loaded
into pot, (2) softened polymer is pressed into mold cavity and cured, and (3) part is ejected.

E1C13

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

‘‘pot’’ through a vertical sprue channel into the cavity; and (b) plunger transfer molding, in
which the charge is injected by means of a plunger from a heated well through lateral
channels into the mold cavity. In both cases, scrap is produced each cycle in the form of
the leftover material in the base of the well and lateral channels, called the cull. In
addition, the sprue in pot transfer is scrap material. Because the polymers are thermosetting, the scrap cannot be recovered.
Transfer molding is closely related to compression molding, because it is used on the
same polymer types (thermosets and elastomers). One can also see similarities to injection
molding, in the way the charge is preheated in a separate chamber and then injected into the
mold. Transfer molding is capable of molding part shapes that are more intricate than
compression molding but not as intricate as injection molding. Transfer molding also lends
itself to molding with inserts, in which a metal or ceramic insert is placed into the cavity
before injection, and the heated plastic bonds to the insert during molding.

13.8 BLOW MOLDING AND ROTATIONAL MOLDING
Both of these processes are used to make hollow, seamless parts out of thermoplastic
polymers. Rotational molding can also be used for thermosets. Parts range in size from
small plastic bottles of only 5 mL (0.15 oz) to large storage drums of 38,000-L (10,000-gal)
capacity. Although the two processes compete in certain cases, generally they have found
their own niches. Blow molding is more suited to the mass production of small disposable
containers, whereas rotational molding favors large, hollow shapes.

13.8.1 BLOW MOLDING
Blow molding is a molding process in which air pressure is used to inflate soft plastic
inside a mold cavity. It is an important industrial process for making one-piece hollow
plastic parts with thin walls, such as bottles and similar containers. Because many of these
items are used for consumer beverages for mass markets, production is typically
organized for very high quantities. The technology is borrowed from the glass industry
(Section 12.2.1) with which plastics compete in the disposable and recyclable bottle
market.
Blow molding is accomplished in two steps: (1) fabrication of a starting tube of
molten plastic, called a parison (same as in glass-blowing); and (2) inflation of the tube to
the desired final shape. Forming the parison is accomplished by either extrusion or
injection molding. The video clip on plastic blow molding illustrates the two categories.

processes, (2) extrusion blow molding, and (3) injection blow molding.

Extrusion Blow Molding This form of blow molding consists of the cycle illustrated in
Figure 13.30. In most cases, the process is organized as a very high production operation
for making plastic bottles. The sequence is automated and often integrated with downstream operations such as bottle filling and labeling.
It is usually a requirement that the blown container be rigid, and rigidity depends on
wall thickness among other factors. We can relate wall thickness of the blown container to
the starting extruded parison [12], assuming a cylindrical shape for the final product. The
effect of die swell on the parison is shown in Figure 13.31. The mean diameter of the tube as

The amount of die swell in the initial extrusion process can be measured by direct
observation; and the dimensions of the die are known. Thus, we can determine the wall
thickness on the blow-molded container.
Injection Blow Molding In this process, the starting parison is injection molded rather
than extruded. A simplified sequence is outlined in Figure 13.32. Compared to its
extrusion-based competitor, injection blow molding usually has the following advantages: (1) higher production rate, (2) greater accuracy in the final dimensions, (3) lower
scrap rates, and (4) less wasteful of material. On the other hand, larger containers can be
produced with extrusion blow molding because the mold in injection molding is so
expensive for large parisons. Also, extrusion blow molding is technically more feasible
and economical for double-layer bottles used for storing certain medicines, personal care
products, and various chemical compounds.2
In a variation of injection blow molding, called stretch blow molding (Figure 13.33),
the blowing rod extends downward into the injection molded parison during step 2, thus
stretching the soft plastic and creating a more favorable stressing of the polymer than
conventional injection blow molding or extrusion blow molding. The resulting structure is
more rigid, with higher transparency and better impact resistance. The most widely used
material for stretch blow molding is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polyester that has
very low permeability and is strengthened by the stretch-blow-molding process. The
combination of properties makes it ideal as a container for carbonated beverages (e.g.,
2-L soda bottles).
Materials and Products Blow molding is limited to thermoplastics. Polyethylene is the
polymer most commonly used for blow molding—in particular, high density and high
molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE and HMWPE). In comparing their properties with
those of low density PE given the requirement for stiffness in the final product, it is more

economical to use these more expensive materials because the container walls can be made
thinner. Other blow moldings are made of polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC),
and polyethylene terephthalate.
Disposable containers for packaging liquid consumer goods constitute the major
share of products made by blow molding; but they are not the only products. Other items
include large shipping drums (55-gal) for liquids and powders, large storage tanks (2000gal), automotive gasoline tanks, toys, and hulls for sail boards and small boats. In the
latter case, two boat hulls are made in a single blow molding and subsequently cut into
two open hulls.

13.8.2 ROTATIONAL MOLDING
Rotational molding uses gravity inside a rotating mold to achieve a hollow form. Also
called rotomolding, it is an alternative to blow molding for making large, hollow shapes. It is
used principally for thermoplastic polymers, but applications for thermosets and elastomers are becoming more common. Rotomolding tends to favor more complex external
geometries, larger parts, and lower production quantities than blow molding. The process
consists of the following steps: (1) A predetermined amount of polymer powder is loaded
into the cavity of a split mold. (2) The mold is then heated and simultaneously rotated on
two perpendicular axes, so that the powder impinges on all internal surfaces of the mold,
gradually forming a fused layer of uniform thickness. (3) While still rotating, the mold is
cooled so that the plastic skin solidifies. (4) The mold is opened, and the part is unloaded.
Rotational speeds used in the process are relatively slow. It is gravity, not centrifugal force,
that causes uniform coating of the mold surfaces.
Molds in rotational molding are simple and inexpensive compared with injection
molding or blow molding, but the production cycle is much longer, lasting perhaps 10 min
or more. To balance these advantages and disadvantages in production, rotational
molding is often performed on a multicavity indexing machine, such as the three-station
machine shown in Figure 13.34. The machine is designed so that three molds are indexed
in sequence through three workstations. Thus, all three molds are working simultaneously. The first workstation is an unload–load station in which the finished part is
unloaded from the mold, and the powder for the next part is loaded into the cavity. The
second station consists of a heating chamber where hot-air convection heats the mold
while it is simultaneously rotated. Temperatures inside the chamber are around 375 C

(700 F), depending on the polymer and the item being molded. The third station cools the
mold, using forced cold air or water spray, to cool and solidify the plastic molding inside.
A fascinating variety of articles are made by rotational molding. The list includes
hollow toys such as hobby horses and playing balls; boat and canoe hulls, sandboxes, small
swimming pools; buoys and other flotation devices; truck body parts, automotive dashboards, fuel tanks; luggage pieces, furniture, garbage cans; fashion mannequins; large
industrial barrels, containers, and storage tanks; portable outhouses, and septic tanks. The
most popular molding material is polyethylene, especially HDPE. Other plastics include
polypropylene, ABS, and high-impact polystyrene.

13.9 THERMOFORMING
Thermoforming is a process in which a flat thermoplastic sheet is heated and deformed
into the desired shape. The process is widely used in packaging of consumer products and
fabricating large items such as bathtubs, contoured skylights, and internal door liners for
refrigerators.
Thermoforming consists of two main steps: heating and forming. Heating is usually
accomplished by radiant electric heaters, located on one or both sides of the starting plastic
sheetatadistanceofroughly125mm(5in).Duration oftheheatingcycleneededtosufficiently
soften thesheetdepends on thepolymer—its thickness and color.Methods bywhichformingis
accomplished can be classified into three basic categories: (1) vacuum thermoforming, (2)
pressure thermoforming, and (3) mechanical thermoforming. In our discussion of these
methods, we describe the forming of sheet stock, but in the packaging industry most
thermoforming operations are performed on thin films.
Vacuum Thermoforming This was the first thermoforming process (simply called
vacuum forming when it was developed in the 1950s). Negative pressure is used to draw a
preheated sheet into a mold cavity. The process is explained in Figure 13.35 in its most

basic form. The holes for drawing the vacuum in the mold are on the order of 0.8 mm
(0.031 in) in diameter, so their effect on the plastic surface is minor.
Pressure Thermoforming An alternative to vacuum forming involves positive pressure to force the heated plastic into the mold cavity. This is called pressure thermoforming
or blow forming; its advantage over vacuum forming is that higher pressures can be
developed because the latter is limited to a theoretical maximum of 1 atm. Blow-forming
pressures of 3 to 4 atm are common. The process sequence is similar to the previous, the
difference being that the sheet is pressurized from above into the mold cavity. Vent holes
are provided in the mold to exhaust the trapped air. The forming portion of the sequence
(steps 2 and 3) is illustrated in Figure 13.36.
At this point it is useful to distinguish between negative and positive molds. The
molds shown in Figures 13.35 and 13.36 are negative molds because they have concave
cavities. A positive mold has a convex shape. Both types are used in thermoforming. In
the case of the positive mold, the heated sheet is draped over the convex form and
negative or positive pressure is used to force the plastic against the mold surface. A
positive mold is shown in Figure 13.37 for vacuum thermoforming.
The difference between positive and negative molds may seem unimportant,
because the part shapes are the same in the diagrams. However, if the part is drawn
into the negative mold, then its exterior surface will have the exact surface contour of the
mold cavity. The inside surface will be an approximation of the contour and will possess a
finish corresponding to that of the starting sheet. By contrast, if the sheet is draped over a
positive mold, then its interior surface will be identical to that of the convex mold; and its
outside surface will follow approximately. Depending on the requirements of the
product, this distinction might be important.

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

FIGURE 13.36 Pressure thermoforming. The sequence is similar to the previous figure, the difference being:
(2) sheet is placed over a mold cavity; and (3) positive pressure forces the sheet into the cavity.

Another difference is in the thinning of the plastic sheet, one of the problems in
thermoforming. Unless the contour of the mold is very shallow, there will be significant
thinning of the sheet as it is stretched to conform to the mold contour. Positive and
negative molds produce a different pattern of thinning in a given part. Consider the tubshaped part in our figures. In the positive mold, as the sheet is draped over the convex
form, the portion making contact with the top surface (corresponding to the base of the
tub) solidifies quickly and experiences virtually no stretching. This results in a thick base
but significant thinning in the walls of the tub. By contrast, a negative mold results in a
more even distribution of stretching and thinning in the sheet before contact is made with
the cold surface.
A way to improve the thinning distribution with a positive mold is to prestretch the
sheet before draping it over the convex form. As shown in Figure 13.38, the heated plastic
sheet is stretched uniformly by vacuum pressure into a spherical shape before drawing it
over the mold.
The first step depicted in frame (1) of Figure 13.38 can be used alone as a method to
produce globe-shaped parts such as skylight windows and transparent domes. In the
process, closely controlled air pressure is applied to inflate the soft sheet. The pressure is
maintained until the blown shape has solidified.

Mechanical Thermoforming The third method, called mechanical thermoforming,
uses matching positive and negative molds that are brought together against the heated
plastic sheet, forcing it to assume their shape. In pure mechanical forming, air pressure is
not used at all. The process is illustrated in Figure 13.39. Its advantages are better
dimensional control and the opportunity for surface detailing on both sides of the part.
The disadvantage is that two mold halves are required; therefore, the molds for the other
two methods are less costly.
Applications Thermoforming is a secondary shaping process, the primary process being
that which produces the sheet or film (Section 13.3). Only thermoplastics can be thermoformed, because extruded sheets of thermosetting or elastomeric polymers have already
been cross-linked and cannot be softened by reheating. Common thermoforming plastics
are polystyrene, cellulose acetate and cellulose acetate butyrate, ABS, PVC, acrylic
(polymethylmethacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene.

Chapter 13/Shaping Processes for Plastics

Mass production thermoforming operations are performed in the packaging industry.
The starting sheet or film is rapidly fed through a heating chamber and then mechanically
formed into the desired shape. The operations are often designed to produce multiple parts
with each stroke of the press using molds with multiple cavities. In some cases, the extrusion
machine that produces the sheet or film is located directly upstream from the thermoforming process, thereby eliminating the need to reheat the plastic. For best efficiency, the filling
process to put the consumable food item into the container is placed immediately downstream from thermoforming.
Thin film packaging items that are mass produced by thermoforming include blister
packs and skin packs. They offer an attractive way to display certain commodity products
such as cosmetics, toiletries, small tools, and fasteners (nails, screws, etc.). Thermoforming applications include large parts that can be produced from thicker sheet stock.
Examples include covers for business machines, boat hulls, shower stalls, diffusers for
lights, advertising displays and signs, bathtubs, and certain toys. Contoured skylights and
internal door liners for refrigerators are made, respectively, out of acrylic (because of its
transparency) and ABS (because of its ease in forming and resistance to oils and fats
found in refrigerators).

13.10

CASTING
In polymer shaping, casting involves pouring of a liquid resin into a mold, using gravity to
fill the cavity, and allowing the polymer to harden. Both thermoplastics and thermosets are
cast. Examples of the former include acrylics, polystyrene, polyamides (nylons), and vinyls
(PVC). Conversion of the liquid resin into a hardened thermoplastic can be accomplished
in several ways, which include (1) heating the thermoplastic resin to a highly fluid state so
that it readily pours and fills the mold cavity, and then permitting it to cool and solidify in
the mold; (2) using a low-molecular-weight prepolymer (or monomer) and polymerizing it
in the mold to form a high-molecular-weight thermoplastic; and (3) pouring a plastisol (a
liquid suspension of fine particles of a thermoplastic resin such as PVC in a plasticizer) into
a heated mold so that it gels and solidifies.
Thermosetting polymers shaped by casting include polyurethane, unsaturated
polyesters, phenolics, and epoxies. The process involves pouring the liquid ingredients
that form the thermoset into a mold so that polymerization and cross-linking occur. Heat
and/or catalysts may be required depending on the resin system. The reactions must be
sufficiently slow to allow mold pouring to be completed. Fast-reacting thermosetting
systems, such as certain polyurethane systems, require alternative shaping processes like
reaction injection molding (Section 13.6.5).
Advantages of casting over alternative processes such as injection molding include:
(1) the mold is simpler and less costly, (2) the cast item is relatively free of residual stresses
and viscoelastic memory, and (3) the process is suited to low production quantities.
Focusing on advantage (2), acrylic sheets (Plexiglas, Lucite) are generally cast between
two pieces of highly polished plate glass. The casting process permits a high degree of
flatness and desirable optical qualities to be achieved in the clear plastic sheets. Such
flatness and clarity cannot be obtained by flat sheet extrusion. A disadvantage in some
applications is significant shrinkage of the cast part during solidification. For example,
acrylic sheets undergo a volumetric contraction of about 20% when cast. This is much
more than in injection molding, in which high pressures are used to pack the mold cavity to
reduce shrinkage.
Slush casting is an alternative to conventional casting, borrowed from metal casting
technology. In slush casting, a liquid plastisol is poured into the cavity of a heated split
mold, so that a skin forms at the surface of the mold. After a duration that depends on the

desired thickness of the skin, the excess liquid is poured out of the mold; the mold is then
opened for part removal. The process is also referred to as shell casting [6].
An important application of casting in electronics is encapsulation, in which items
such as transformers, coils, connectors, and other electrical components are encased in
plastic by casting.

13.11

POLYMER FOAM PROCESSING AND FORMING
A polymer foam is a polymer-and-gas mixture, which gives the material a porous or
cellular structure. Other terms used for polymer foams include cellular polymer, blown
polymer, and expanded polymer. The most common polymer foams are polystyrene
(Styrofoam) and polyurethane. Other polymers used to make foams include natural
rubber (‘‘foamed rubber’’) and polyvinylchloride (PVC).
The characteristic properties of a foamed polymer include (1) low density, (2) high
strength per unit weight, (3) good thermal insulation, and (4) good energy absorbing
qualities. The elasticity of the base polymer determines the corresponding property of
the foam. Polymer foams can be classified [6] as (1) elastomeric, in which the matrix
polymer is a rubber, capable of large elastic deformation; (2) flexible, in which the matrix
is a highly plasticized polymer such as soft PVC; and (3) rigid, in which the polymer is a
stiff thermoplastic such as polystyrene or a thermosetting plastic such as a phenolic.
Depending on chemical formulation and degree of cross-linking, polyurethanes can
range over all three categories.
The characteristic properties of polymer foams, and the ability to control their
elastic behavior through selection of the base polymer, make these materials highly
suitable for certain types of applications, including hot beverage cups, heat insulating
structural materials and cores for structural panels, packaging materials, cushion materials for furniture and bedding, padding for automobile dashboards, and products requiring
buoyancy.
Common gases used in polymer foams are air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The
proportion of gas can range up to 90% or more. The gas is introduced into the polymer by
several methods, called foaming processes. These include (1) mixing a liquid resin with air
by mechanical agitation, then hardening the polymer by means of heat or chemical
reaction; (2) mixing a physical blowing agent with the polymer—a gas such as nitrogen
(N2) or pentane (C5H12), which can be dissolved in the polymer melt under pressure, so
that the gas comes out of solution and expands when the pressure is subsequently
reduced; and (3) mixing the polymer with chemical compounds, called chemical blowing
agents, that decompose at elevated temperatures to liberate gases such as CO2 or N2
within the melt.
The way the gas is distributed throughout the polymer matrix distinguishes two
basic foam structures, illustrated in Figure 13.40: (a) closed cell, in which the gas pores
are roughly spherical and completely separated from each other by the polymer matrix;
and (b) open cell, in which the pores are interconnected to some extent, allowing passage
of a fluid through the foam. A closed cell structure makes a satisfactory life jacket; an
open cell structure would become waterlogged. Other attributes that characterize the
structure include the relative proportions of polymer and gas (already mentioned) and
the cell density (number of cells per unit volume), which is inversely related to the size of
the individual air cells in the foam.
There are many shaping processes for polymer foam products. Because the two
most important foams are polystyrene and polyurethane, this discussion is limited to
shaping processes for these two materials. Because polystyrene is a thermoplastic and
polyurethane can be either a thermoset or an elastomer (it can also be a thermoplastic but

is less important in this form), the processes covered here for these materials are
representative of those used for other polymer foams.
Polystyrene foams are shaped by extrusion and molding. In extrusion, a physical or
chemical blowing agent is fed into the polymer melt near the die end of the extruder
barrel; thus, the extrudate consists of the expanded polymer. Large sheets and boards are
made in this way and are subsequently cut to size for heat insulation panels and sections.
Several moldingprocessesare available for polystyrene foam. We previouslydiscussed
structuralfoammoldingandsandwichmolding(Section13.6.5).Amorewidelyusedprocess
is expandable foam molding, in which the molding material usually consists of prefoamed
polystyrene beads. The prefoamed beads are produced from pellets of solid polystyrene that
have been impregnated with a physical blowing agent. Prefoaming is performed in a large
tank by applying steam heat to partially expand the pellets, simultaneously agitating them to
prevent fusion. Then, in the molding process, the prefoamed beads are fed into a mold cavity,
where they are further expanded and fused together to form the molded product. Hot
beverage cups of polystyrene foam are produced in this way. In some processes, the
prefoaming step is omitted, and the impregnated beads are fed directly into the mold cavity,
where they are heated, expanded, and fused. In other operations, the expandable foam is first
formedintoaflatsheetbythe blown-filmextrusionprocess (Section13.3) andthenshapedby
thermoforming (Section 13.9) into packaging containers such as egg cartons.
Polyurethane foam products are made in a one-step process in which the two liquid
ingredients (polyol and isocyanate) are mixed and immediately fed into a mold or other
form, so that the polymer is synthesized and the part geometry is created at the same time.
Shaping processes for polyurethane foam can be divided into two basic types [11]: spraying
and pouring. Spraying involves use of a spray gun into which the two ingredients are
continuously fed, mixed, and then sprayed onto a target surface. The reactions leading to
polymerization and foaming occur after application on the surface. This method is used to
apply rigid insulating foams onto construction panels, railway cars, and similar large items.
Pouring involves dispensing the ingredients from a mixing head into an open or closed mold
in which the reactions occur. An open mold can be a container with the required contour (e.
g., for an automobile seat cushion) or a long channel that is slowly moved past the pouring
spout to make long, continuous sections of foam. The closed mold is a completely enclosed
cavity into which a certain amount of the mixture is dispensed. Expansion of the reactants
completely fills the cavity to shape the part. For fast-reacting polyurethanes, the mixture
must be rapidly injected into the mold cavity using reaction injection molding (Section
13.66). The degree of cross-linking, controlled by the starting ingredients, determines the
relative stiffness of the resulting foam.

13.12

PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Plastics are an important design material, but the designer must be aware of their
limitations. This section lists some design guidelines for plastic components, beginning
with those that apply in general, and then ones applicable to extrusion and molding
(injection molding, compression molding, and transfer molding).

E1C13

15:30:34

Page 309

Section 13.12/Product Design Considerations

309

Several general guidelines apply, irrespective of the shaping process. They are
mostly limitations of plastic materials that must be considered by the designer.
å Strength and stiffness. Plastics are not as strong or stiff as metals. They should not be
used in applications in which high stresses will be encountered. Creep resistance is
also a limitation. Strength properties vary significantly among plastics, and strengthto-weight ratios for some plastics are competitive with metals in certain applications.
å Impact resistance. The capacity of plastics to absorb impact is generally good;
plastics compare favorably with most metals.
å Service temperatures of plastics are limited relative to engineering metals and ceramics.
å Thermal expansion is greater for plastics than metals; so dimensional changes owing
to temperature variations are much more significant than for metals.
å Many types of plastics are subject to degradation from sunlight and certain other forms
of radiation. Also, some plastics degrade in oxygen and ozone atmospheres. Finally,
plastics are soluble in many common solvents. On the positive side, plastics are resistant
to conventional corrosion mechanisms that afflict many metals. The weaknesses of
specific plastics must be taken into account by the designer.
Extrusion is one of the most widely used plastic shaping processes. Several design
recommendations are presented here for conventional extrusion (compiledmostly from [3]).
å Wall thickness. Uniform wall thickness is desirable in an extruded cross section.
Variations in wall thickness result in nonuniform plastic flow and uneven cooling that
tend to warp the extrudate.
å Hollow sections. Hollow sections complicate die design and plastic flow. It is
desirable to use extruded cross sections that are not hollow yet satisfy functional
requirements.
å Corners. Sharp corners, inside and outside, should be avoided in the cross section,
because they result in uneven flow during processing and stress concentrations in the
final product.
The following guidelines apply to injection molding (the most popular molding
process), compression molding, and transfer molding (compiled from Bralla [3], McCrum
[10], and other sources).
å Economic production quantities. Each molded part requires a unique mold, and the
mold for any of these processes can be costly, particularly for injection molding.
Minimum production quantities for injection molding are usually around 10,000
pieces; for compression molding, minimum quantities are around 1000 parts, because
of the simpler mold designs involved. Transfer molding lies between the other two.
å Part complexity. Although more complex part geometries mean more costly molds,
it may nevertheless be economical to design a complex molding if the alternative
involves many individual components assembled together. An advantage of plastic
molding is that it allows multiple functional features to be combined into one part.
å Wall thickness. Thick cross sections are generally undesirable; they are wasteful of
material, more likely to cause warping caused by shrinkage, and take longer to
harden. Reinforcing ribs can be used in molded plastic parts to achieve increased
stiffness without excessive wall thickness. The ribs should be made thinner than the
walls they reinforce, to minimize sink marks on the outside wall.
å Corner radii and fillets. Sharp corners, both external and internal, are undesirable in
molded parts; they interrupt smooth flow of the melt, tend to create surface defects,
and cause stress concentrations in the finished part.

å Holes. Holes are quite feasible in plastic moldings, but they complicate mold design
and part removal. They also cause interruptions in melt flow.
å Draft. A molded part should be designed with a draft on its sides to facilitate
removal from the mold. This is especially important on the inside wall of a cupshaped part because the molded plastic contracts against the positive mold shape.
The recommended draft for thermosets is around 1/2 to 1 ; for thermoplastics it
usually ranges between 1/8 and 1/2 . Suppliers of plastic molding compounds
provide recommended draft values for their products.
å Tolerances. Tolerances specify the allowable manufacturing variations for a part.
Although shrinkage is predictable under closely controlled conditions, generous
tolerances are desirable for injection moldings because of variations in process
parameters that affect shrinkage and diversity of part geometries encountered. Table
13.2 lists typical tolerances for molded part dimensions of selected plastics.

Many of the shaping processes used for plastics (Chapter 13)
are also applicable to rubbers. However, rubber-processing
technology is different in certain respects, and the rubber
industry is largely separate from the plastics industry. The
rubber industry and goods made of rubber are dominated by
one product: tires. Tires are used in large numbers for
automobiles, trucks, aircraft, and bicycles. Although pneumatic tires date from the late 1880s, rubber technology can
be traced to the discovery in 1839 of vulcanization (Historical Note 8.2), the process by which raw natural rubber is
transformed into a usable material through cross–linking of
the polymer molecules. During its first century, the rubber
industry was concerned only with the processing of natural
rubber. Around World War II, synthetic rubbers were developed (Historical Note 8.3); today they account for the
majority of rubber production.

14.1 RUBBER PROCESSING
AND SHAPING
Production of rubber goods can be divided into two basic
steps: (1) production of the rubber itself, and (2) processing
of the rubber into finished goods. Production of rubber
differs, depending on whether it is natural or synthetic. The
difference results from the source of the raw materials.
Natural rubber (NR) is produced as an agricultural crop,
whereas most synthetic rubbers are made from petroleum.
Production of rubber is followed by processing into
final products; this consists of (1) compounding, (2) mixing,
(3) shaping, and (4) vulcanizing. Processing techniques for
natural and synthetic rubbers are virtually the same, differences being in the chemicals used to effect vulcanization
(cross–linking). This sequence does not apply to thermoplastic elastomers, whose shaping techniques are the same
as for other thermoplastic polymers.

Chapter 14/Rubber-Processing Technology

There are several distinct industries involved in the production and processing of
rubber. Production of raw natural rubber might be classified as farming because latex, the
starting ingredient for natural rubber, is grown on large plantations located in tropical
climates. By contrast, synthetic rubbers are produced by the petrochemical industry.
Finally, the processing of these materials into tires, shoe soles, and other rubber products
occurs at processor (fabricator) plants. The processors are commonly known as the rubber
industry. Some of the great names in this industry include Goodyear, B. F. Goodrich, and
Michelin. The importance of the tire is reflected in these names.

14.1.1 PRODUCTION OF RUBBER
In this section we briefly survey the production of rubber before it goes to the processor.
Our coverage distinguishes natural rubber and synthetic rubber.
Natural Rubber Natural rubber is tapped from rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) as
latex. The trees are grown on plantations in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world.
Latex is a colloidal dispersion of solid particles of the polymer polyisoprene (Section
8.4.2) in water. Polyisoprene is the chemical substance that comprises rubber, and its
content in the emulsion is about 30%. The latex is collected in large tanks, thus blending
the yield of many trees together.
The preferred method of recovering rubber from the latex involves coagulation. The
latex is first diluted with water to about half its natural concentration. An acid such as
formic acid (HCOOH) or acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to cause the latex to coagulate
after about 12 hours. The coagulum, now in the form of soft solid slabs, is then squeezed
through a series of rolls that drive out most of the water and reduce the thickness to about 3
mm (1/8 in). The final rolls have grooves that impart a criss-cross pattern to the resulting
sheets. The sheets are then draped over wooden frames and dried in smokehouses. The hot
smoke contains creosote, which prevents mildew and oxidation of the rubber. Several days
are normally required to complete the drying process. The resulting rubber, now in a form
called ribbed smoked sheet, is folded into large bales for shipment to the processor. This raw
rubber has a characteristic dark brown color. In some cases, the sheets are dried in hot air
rather than smokehouses, and the term air-dried sheet is applied; this is considered to be a
better grade of rubber. A still better grade, called pale crepe rubber, involves two
coagulation steps; the first removes undesirable components of the latex, then the resulting
coagulum is subjected to a more involved washing and mechanical working procedure,
followed by warm air drying. The color of pale crepe rubber approaches a light tan.
Synthetic Rubber The various types of synthetic rubber were identified in Section 8.4.3.
Most synthetics are produced from petroleum by the same polymerization techniques used
to synthesize other polymers (Section 8.1.1). However, unlike thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, which are normally supplied to the fabricator as pellets or liquid resins,
synthetic rubbers are supplied to rubber processors in the form of large bales. The industry
has developed a long tradition of handling natural rubber in these unit loads.

14.1.2 COMPOUNDING
Rubber is always compounded with additives. It is through compounding that the specific
rubber is designed to satisfy the given application in terms of properties, cost, and
processability. Compounding adds chemicals for vulcanization. Sulfur has traditionally

E1C14

11/10/2009

13:21:53

Page 317

Section 14.1/Rubber Processing and Shaping

317

been used for this purpose. The vulcanization process and the chemicals used to
accomplish it are discussed in Section 14.1.5.
Additives include fillers that act either to enhance the rubber’s mechanical
properties (reinforcing fillers) or to extend the rubber to reduce cost (nonreinforcing
fillers). The single most important reinforcing filler in rubber is carbon black, a colloidal
form of carbon, black in color, obtained from the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons (soot). Its effect is to increase tensile strength and resistance to abrasion and
tearing of the final rubber product. Carbon black also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. These enhancements are especially important in tires. Most rubber parts
are black in color because of their carbon black content.
Although carbon black is the most important filler, others are also used. They
include china clays—hydrous aluminum silicates (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), which provide less
reinforcing than carbon black but are used when the black color is not acceptable;
calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is a nonreinforcing filler; and silica (SiO2), which can
serve reinforcing or nonreinforcing functions, depending on particle size; and other
polymers, such as styrene, PVC, and phenolics. Reclaimed (recycled) rubber is also added
as a filler in some rubber products, but usually not in proportions exceeding 10%.
Other additives compounded with the rubber include antioxidants, to retard aging by
oxidation; fatigue- and ozone-protective chemicals; coloring pigments; plasticizers and
softening oils; blowing agents in the production of foamed rubber; and mold-release
compounds.
Many products require filament reinforcement to reduce extensibility but retain the
other desirable properties of rubber. Tires and conveyor belts are notableexamples. Filaments
used for this purpose include cellulose, nylon, and polyester. Fiberglass and steel are also used
as reinforcements (e.g., steel-belted radial tires). These continuous fiber materials must be
added as part of the shaping process; they are not mixed with the other additives.

14.1.3 MIXING
The additives must be thoroughly mixed with the base rubber to achieve uniform
dispersion of the ingredients. Uncured rubbers possess high viscosity. Mechanical working experienced by the rubber can increase its temperature up to 150 C (300 F). If
vulcanizing agents were present from the start of mixing, premature vulcanization would
result—the rubber processor’s nightmare [7]. Accordingly, a two-stage mixing process is
usually employed. In the first stage, carbon black and other nonvulcanizing additives are
combined with the raw rubber. The term masterbatch is used for this first-stage mixture.
After thorough mixing has been accomplished, and time for cooling has been allowed,
the second stage is carried out in which the vulcanizing agents are added.
Equipment for mixing includes the two-roll mill and internal mixers such as the
Banbury mixer (Figure 14.1). The two-roll mill consists of two parallel rolls, supported in
a frame so they can be brought together to obtain a desired ‘‘nip’’ (gap size), and driven to
rotate at the same or slightly different speeds. An internal mixer has two rotors encased
in a jacket, as in Figure 14.1(b) for the Banbury-type internal mixer. The rotors have
blades and rotate in opposite directions at different speeds, causing a complex flow
pattern in the contained mixture.

14.1.4 SHAPING AND RELATED PROCESSES
Shaping processes for rubber products can be divided into four basic categories: (1)
extrusion, (2) calendering, (3) coating, and (4) molding and casting. Most of these

processes are discussed in the previous chapter. We will examine the special issues that
arise when they are applied to rubber. Some products require several basic processes plus
assembly work in their manufacture, for example, tires.
Extrusion Extrusion of polymers is discussed in the preceding chapter. Screw extruders
are generally used for extrusion of rubber. As with extrusion of thermosetting plastics,
the L/D ratio of the extruder barrels is less than for thermoplastics, typically in the range
10 to 15, to reduce the risk of premature cross–linking. Die swell occurs in rubber
extrudates, because the polymer is in a highly plastic condition and exhibits the memory
property. It has not yet been vulcanized.
Calendering This process involves passing rubber stock through a series of gaps of
decreasing size made by a stand of rotating rolls (Section 13.3). The rubber process must be
operated at lower temperatures than for thermoplastic polymers, to avoid premature
vulcanization. Also, equipment used in the rubber industry is of heavier construction than
that used for thermoplastics, because rubber is more viscous and harder to form. The
output of the process is a rubber sheet of thickness determined by the final roll gap; again,
swelling occurs in the sheet, causing its thickness to be slightly greater than the gap size.
Calendering can also be used to coat or impregnate textile fabrics to produce rubberized
fabrics.
There are problems in producing thick sheet by either extrusion or calendering.
Thickness control is difficult in the former process, and air entrapment occurs in the latter.
These problems are largely solved when extrusion and calendering are combined in the
roller die process (Figure 14.2). The extruder die is a slit that feeds the calender rolls.
Coating Coating or impregnating fabrics with rubber is an important process in the
rubber industry. These composite materials are used in automobile tires, conveyor belts,
inflatable rafts, and waterproof cloth for tarpaulins, tents, and rain coats. The coating of
rubber onto substrate fabrics includes a variety of processes. We have previously indicated

that calendering is one of the coating methods. Figure 14.3 illustrates one possible way in
which the fabric is fed into the calendering rolls to obtain a reinforced rubber sheet.
Alternatives to calendering include skimming, dipping, and spraying. In the
skimming process, a thick solution of rubber compound in an organic solvent is applied
to the fabric as it is unreeled from a supply spool. The coated fabric passes under a doctor
blade that skims the solvent to the proper thickness, and then moves into a steam
chamber where the solvent is driven off by heat. As its name suggests, dipping involves
temporary immersion of the fabric into a highly fluid solution of rubber, followed by
drying. Likewise, in spraying, a spray gun is used to apply the rubber solution.
Molding and Casting Molded articles include shoe soles and heels, gaskets and seals,
suction cups, and bottle stops. Many foamed rubber parts are produced by molding. In
addition, molding is an important process in tire production. Principal molding processes
for rubber are (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding, and (3) injection molding.
Compression molding is the most important technique because of its use in tire manufacture. Curing (vulcanizing) is accomplished in the mold in all three processes, this
representing a departure from the shaping methods already discussed, which require a
separate vulcanizing step. With injection molding of rubber, there are risks of premature
curing similar to those faced in the same process when applied to thermosetting plastics.
Advantages of injection molding over traditional methods for producing rubber parts
include better dimensional control, less scrap, and shorter cycle times. In addition to its use
in the molding of conventional rubbers, injection molding is also applied for thermoplastic
elastomers. Because of high mold costs, large production quantities are required to justify
injection molding.
A form of casting, called dip casting, is used for producing rubber gloves and overshoes.
It involves submersion of a positive mold in a liquid polymer (or a heated form into plastisol)
for a certain duration (the process may involve repeated dippings) to form the desired
thickness. The coating is then stripped from the form and cured to cross–link the rubber.

14.1.5 VULCANIZATION
Vulcanization is the treatment that accomplishes cross–linking of elastomer molecules, so
that the rubber becomes stiffer and stronger but retains extensibility. It is a critical step in
the rubber processing sequence. On a submicroscopic scale, the process can be pictured
as in Figure 14.4, in which the long-chain molecules of the rubber become joined at
certain tie points, the effect of which is to reduce the ability of the elastomer to flow. A
typical soft rubber has one or two cross–links per thousand units (mers). As the number
of cross–links increases, the polymer becomes stiffer and behaves more like a thermosetting plastic (hard rubber).
Vulcanization, as it was first invented by Goodyear, involved the use of sulfur (about
8 parts by weight of S mixed with 100 parts of natural rubber) at a temperature of 140 C
(280 F) for about 5 hours. No other chemicals were included in the process. Vulcanization
with sulfur alone is no longer used as a commercial treatment today, because of the long
curing times. Various other chemicals, including zinc oxide (ZnO) and stearic acid
(C18H36O2), are combined with smaller doses of sulfur to accelerate and strengthen the
treatment. The resulting cure time is 15 to 20 minutes for a typical passenger car tire. In
addition, various nonsulfur vulcanizing treatments have been developed.
In rubber-molding processes, vulcanization is accomplished in the mold by maintaining the mold temperature at the proper level for curing. In the other forming processes,
vulcanization is performed after the part has been shaped. The treatments generally divide
between batch processes and continuous processes. Batch methods include the use of an
autoclave, a steam-heated pressure vessel; and gas curing, in which a heated inert gas such
as nitrogen cures the rubber. Many of the basic processes make a continuous product, and if
the output is not cut into discrete pieces, continuous vulcanization is appropriate. Continuous methods include high-pressure steam, suited to the curing of rubber coated wire and
cable; hot-air tunnel, for cellular extrusions and carpet underlays [3]; and continuous drum
cure, in which continuous rubber sheets (e.g., belts and flooring materials) pass through one
or more heated rolls to effect vulcanization.

14.2 MANUFACTURE OF TIRES AND OTHER RUBBER PRODUCTS
Tires are the principal product of the rubber industry, accounting for about three fourths
of total tonnage. Other important products include footwear, hose, conveyor belts, seals,
shock-absorbing components, foamed rubber products, and sports equipment.

14.2.1 TIRES
Pneumatic tires are critical components of the vehicles on which they are used. They are
used on automobiles, trucks, buses, farm tractors, earth-moving equipment, military
vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, and aircraft. Tires support the weight of the vehicle and
the passengers and cargo on board; they transmit the motor torque to propel the vehicle
(except on aircraft); and they absorb vibrations and shock to provide a comfortable ride.
Tire Construction and Production Sequence A tire is an assembly of many parts,
whose manufacture is unexpectedly complex. A passenger car tire consists of about 50
individual pieces; a large earthmover tire may have as many as 175. To begin with, there are
three basic tire constructions: (a) diagonal ply, (b) belted bias, and (c) radial ply, pictured in
Figure 14.5. In all three cases, the internal structure of the tire, known as the carcass,
consists of multiple layers of rubber-coated cords, called plies. The cords are strands of
various materials such as nylon, polyester, fiberglass, and steel, which provide inextensibility to reinforce the rubber in the carcass. The diagonal ply tire has the cords running
diagonally, but in perpendicular directions in adjacent layers. A typical diagonal ply tire
may have four plies. The belted bias tire is constructed of diagonal plies with opposite bias
but adds several more layers around the outside periphery of the carcass. These belts
increase the stiffness of the tire in the tread area and limit its diametric expansion during
inflation. The cords in the belt also run diagonally, as indicated in the sketch.
A radial tire has plies running radially rather than diagonally; it also uses belts
around the periphery for support. A steel-belted radial is a tire in which the circumferential

Chapter 14/Rubber-Processing Technology

belts have cords made of steel. The radial construction provides a more flexible sidewall,
which tends to reduce stress on the belts and treads as they continually deform on contact
with the flat road surface during rotation. This effect is accompanied by greater tread life,
improved cornering and driving stability, and a better ride at high speeds.
In each construction, the carcass is covered by solid rubber that reaches a maximum
thickness in the tread area. The carcass is also lined on the inside with a rubber coating.
For tires with inner tubes, the inner liner is a thin coating applied to the innermost ply
during its fabrication. For tubeless tires, the inner liner must have low permeability
because it holds the air pressure; it is generally a laminated rubber.
Tire production can be summarized in three steps: (1) preforming of components,
(2) building the carcass and adding rubber strips to form the sidewalls and treads, and
(3) molding and curing the components into one integral piece. The descriptions of these
steps that follow are typical; there are variations in processing depending on construction,
tire size, and type of vehicle on which the tire will be used.
Preforming of Components As Figure 14.5 shows, the carcass consists of a number of
separate components, most of which are rubber or reinforced rubber. These, as well as the
sidewall and tread rubber, are produced by continuous processes and then pre-cut to size
and shape for subsequent assembly. The components, labeled in Figure 14.5, and the
preforming processes to fabricate them are:
å Bead coil. Continuous steel wire is rubber-coated, cut, coiled, and the ends joined.
å Plies. Continuous fabric (textile, nylon, fiber glass, steel) is rubber coated in a
calendering process and pre-cut to size and shape.
å Inner lining. For tube tires, the inner liner is calendered onto the innermost ply. For
tubeless tires, the liner is calendered as a two-layered laminate.
å Belts. Continuous fabric is rubber coated (similar to plies), but cut at different angles
for better reinforcement; then made into a multi-ply belt.
å Tread. Extruded as continuous strip; then cut and preassembled to belts.
å Sidewall. Extruded as continuous strip; then cut to size and shape.
Building the Carcass The carcass is traditionally assembled using a machine known as a
building drum, whose main element is a cylindrical arbor that rotates. Pre-cut strips that
form the carcass are built up around this arbor in a step-by-step procedure. The layered
plies that form the cross section of the tire are anchored on opposite sides of the rim by two
bead coils. The bead coils consist of multiple strands of high-strength steel wire. Their
function is to provide a rigid support when the finished tire is mounted on the wheel rim.
Other components are combined with the plies and bead coils. These include various
wrappings and filler pieces to give the tire the proper strength, heat resistance, air retention,
and fitting to the wheel rim. After these parts are placed around the arbor and the proper
number of plies have been added, the belts are applied. This is followed by the outside
rubber that will become the sidewall and tread.1 At this point in the process, the treads are
rubber strips of uniform cross section—the tread design is added later in molding. The
building drum is collapsible, so that the unfinished tire can be removed when finished. The
form of the tire at this stage is roughly tubular, as portrayed in Figure 14.6.
Molding and Curing Tire molds are usually two-piece construction (split molds) and
contain the tread pattern to be impressed on the tire. The mold is bolted into a press, one
half attached to the upper platen (the lid) and the bottom half fastened to the lower

Technically, the tread and sidewall are not usually considered to be components of the carcass.

platen (the base). The uncured tire is placed over an expandable diaphragm and inserted
between the mold halves, as in Figure 14.7. The press is then closed and the diaphragm
expanded, so that the soft rubber is pressed against the cavity of the mold. This causes the
tread pattern to be imparted to the rubber. At the same time, the rubber is heated, both
from the outside by the mold and from the inside by the diaphragm. Circulating hot water
or steam under pressure are used to heat the diaphragm. The duration of this curing step
depends on the thickness of the tire wall. A typical passenger tire can be cured in about 15
minutes. Bicycle tires cure in about 4 minutes, whereas tires for large earth-moving
equipment take several hours to cure. After curing is completed, the tire is cooled and
removed from the press.

14.2.2 OTHER RUBBER PRODUCTS
Most other rubber products are made by less complex processes. Rubber belts are widely
used in conveyors and mechanical power transmission systems. As with tires, rubber is an
ideal material for these products, but the belt must have flexibility but little or no
extensibility to function. Accordingly, it is reinforced with fibers, commonly polyester
or nylon. Fabrics of these polymers are usually coated in calendering operations, assembled
together to obtain the required number of plies and thickness, and subsequently vulcanized
by continuous or batch heating processes.
Rubber hose can be either plain or reinforced. Plain hose is extruded tubing.
Reinforced tube consists of an inner tube, a reinforcing layer (sometimes called
the carcass), and a cover. The internal tubing is extruded of a rubber that has been

compounded for the particular substance that will flow through it. The reinforcement
layer is applied to the tube in the form of a fabric, or by spiraling, knitting, braiding, or
other application method. The outer layer is compounded to resist environmental
conditions. It is applied by extrusion, using rollers, or other techniques.
Footwear components include soles, heels, rubber overshoes, and certain upper
parts. Various rubbers are used to make footwear components (Section 8.4). Molded
parts are produced by injection molding, compression molding, and certain special
molding techniques developed by the shoe industry; the rubbers include both solid
and foamed varieties. In some cases, for low volume production, manual methods are
used to cut rubber from flat stock.
Rubber is widely used in sports equipment and supplies, including ping pong paddle
surfaces, golf club grips, football bladders, and sports balls of various kinds. Tennis balls,
for example, are made in significant numbers. Production of these sports products relies
on the various shaping processes discussed in Section 14.1.4, as well as special techniques
that have been developed for particular items.

14.2.3 PROCESSING OF THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERS
A thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a thermoplastic polymer that possesses the
properties of a rubber (Section 8.4.3); the term thermoplastic rubber is also used.
TPEs can be processed like thermoplastics, but their applications are those of an
elastomer. The most common shaping processes are injection molding and extrusion,
which are generally more economical and faster than the traditional processes used for
rubbers that must be vulcanized. Molded products include shoe soles, athletic footwear,
and automotive components such as fender extensions and corner panels (but not
tires—TPEs have been found to be unsatisfactory for that application). Extruded items
include insulation coating for electrical wire, tubing for medical applications, conveyor
belts, sheet and film stock. Other shaping techniques for TPEs include blow molding
and thermoforming (Sections 13.8 and 13.9); these processes cannot be used for
vulcanized rubbers.

14.3 PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Many of the same guidelines used for plastics apply to rubber products. There are
differences, owing to the elastomeric properties of rubber. The following are compiled
largely from Bralla [4]; they apply to conventional soft rubber, not hard rubber.
å Economic production quantities. Rubber parts produced by compression molding
(the traditional process) can often be produced in quantities of a thousand or less.
The mold cost is relatively low compared with other molding methods. Injection
molding, as with plastic parts, requires higher production quantities to justify the
more expensive mold.
å Draft. Draft is usually unnecessary for rubber molded parts. The flexibility of the
material allows it to deform for removal from the mold. Shallow undercuts, although
undesirable, are possible with rubber-molded parts for the same reason. The low
stiffness and high elasticity of the material permits removal from the mold.
å Holes. Holes are difficult to cut into the rubber after initial forming, due the
flexibility of the material. It is generally desirable to mold holes into the rubber
during the primary shaping process.

å Screw threads. Screw threads are generally not incorporated into molded rubber
parts; the elastic deformability of rubber makes it difficult to assemble parts using the
threads, and stripping is a problem once inserted.

In this chapter we consider manufacturing processes by
which polymer matrix composites are shaped into useful
components and products. A polymer matrix composite
(PMC) is a composite material consisting of a polymer
embedded with a reinforcing phase such as fibers or powders. The technological and commercial importance of the
processes in this chapter derives from the growing use of
this class of material, especially fiber-reinforced polymers
(FRPs). In popular usage, PMC generally refers to fiberreinforced polymers. FRP composites can be designed with
very high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios.
These features make them attractive in aircraft, cars,
trucks, boats, and sports equipment.
Some of the shaping processes described in this chapter are slow and labor intensive. In general, techniques for
shaping composites are less efficient than manufacturing
processes for other materials. There are two reasons for this:
(1) composite materials are more complex than other materials, consisting as they do of two or more phases and the
need to orient the reinforcing phase in the case of fiberreinforced plastics; and (2) processing technologies for
composites have not been the object of improvement and
refinement over as many years as processes for other
materials.
The variety of shaping methods for fiber-reinforced
polymers is sometimes bewildering to students on first
reading. Let us provide a road map for the reader entering
this new territory. FRP composite shaping processes
can be divided into five categories, as organized in Figure 15.1: (1) open mold processes, (2) closed mold processes, (3) filament winding, (4) pultrusion processes, and
(5) other. Open mold processes include some of the original
manual procedures for laying resins and fibers onto forms.
Closed mold processes are much the same as those used in

plastic molding; the reader will recognize the names—compression molding, transfer
molding, and injection molding—although the names are sometimes changed and modifications are sometimes made for PMCs. In filament winding, continuous filaments that
have been dipped in liquid resin are wrapped around a rotating mandrel; when the resin
cures, a rigid, hollow, generally cylindrical shape is created. Pultrusion is a shaping process
for producing long, straight sections of constant cross section; it is similar to extrusion, but
adapted to include continuous fiber reinforcement. The ‘‘other’’ category includes several
operations that do not fit into the previous categories.
Some of these processes are used to shape composites with continuous fibers,
whereas others are used for short fiber PMCs. Figure 15.1 provides an overview of the
processes in each division. Let us begin our coverage by exploring how the individual
phases in a PMC are produced and how these phases are combined into the starting
materials for shaping. For a good overview of the PMC processes, the reader should
view the video clip titled Composite Materials and Manufacturing.

STARTING MATERIALS FOR PMCS
In a PMC, the starting materials are a polymer and a reinforcing phase. They are
processed separately before becoming phases in the composite. This section considers
how these materials are produced before being combined, and then how they are
combined to make the composite part.

15.1.1 POLYMER MATRIX
All three of the basic polymer types—thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers—are
used as matrices in PMCs. Thermosetting (TS) polymers are the most common matrix
materials. The principal TS polymers are phenolics, unsaturated polyesters, and epoxies.
Phenolics are associated with the use of particulate reinforcing phases, whereas polyesters and epoxies are more closely associated with FRPs. Thermoplastic (TP) polymers
are also used in PMCs, and in fact, most molding compounds are composite materials that
include fillers and/or reinforcing agents. Most elastomers are composite materials
because nearly all rubbers are reinforced with carbon black. Shaping processes for
rubbers are covered in Chapter 14. In this chapter, coverage is limited to the processing of
PMCs that use TS and TP polymers as the matrix. Many of the polymer shaping processes
discussed in Chapter 13 are applicable to polymer matrix composites. However, combining the polymer with the reinforcing agent sometimes complicates the operations.

15.1.2 REINFORCING AGENT
The reinforcing phase can be any of several geometries and materials. The geometries
include fibers, particles, and flakes, and the materials are ceramics, metals, other
polymers, or elements such as carbon or boron. The role of the reinforcing phase and
some of its technical features are discussed in Section 9.1.2.
Fibers Common fiber materials in FRPs are glass, carbon, and the polymer Kevlar.
Fibers of these materials are produced by various techniques, some of which we have
covered in other chapters. Glass fibers are produced by drawing through small orifices
(Section 12.2.3). For carbon, a series of heating treatments is performed to convert a
precursor filament containing a carbon compound into a more pure carbon form. The
precursor can be any of several substances, including polyacrylonitrile (PAN), pitch (a
black carbon resin formed in the distillation of coal tar, wood tar, petroleum, etc.), or
rayon (cellulose). Kevlar fibers are produced by extrusion combined with drawing
through small orifices in a spinneret (Section 13.4).
Starting as continuous filaments, the fibers are combined with the polymer matrix in
any of several forms, depending on the properties desired in the material and the processing
method to be used to shape the composite. In some fabrication processes, the filaments are
continuous, whereas in others they are chopped into short lengths. In the continuous form,
individual filaments are usually available as rovings. A roving is a collection of untwisted
(parallel) continuous strands; this is a convenient form for handling and processing.
Rovings typically contain from 12 to 120 individual strands. By contrast, a yarn is a twisted
collection of filaments. Continuous rovings are used in several PMC processes, including
filament winding and pultrusion.
The most familiar form of continuous fiber is a cloth—a fabric of woven yarns. Very
similar to a cloth, but distinguished here, is a woven roving, a fabric consisting of
untwisted filaments rather than yarns. Woven rovings can be produced with unequal

E1C15

Chapter 15/Shaping Processes for Polymer Matrix Composites

numbers of strands in the two directions so that they possess greater strength in one
direction than the other. Such unidirectional woven rovings are often preferred in
laminated FRP composites.
Fibers can also be prepared in the form of a mat—a felt consisting of randomly
oriented short fibers held loosely together with a binder, sometimes in a carrier fabric.
Mats are commercially available as blankets of various weights, thicknesses, and widths.
Mats can be cut and shaped for use as preforms in some of the closed mold processes.
During molding, the resin impregnates the preform and then cures, thus yielding a fiberreinforced molding.
Particles and Flakes Particles and flakes are really in the same class. Flakes are
particles whose length and width are large relative to thickness. We discuss these and
other issues on characterization of engineering powders in Section 16.1. Production
methods for metal powders are discussed in Section 16.2, and techniques for producing
ceramic powders are discussed in Section 17.1.1.

15.1.3 COMBINING MATRIX AND REINFORCEMENT
Incorporation of the reinforcing agent into the polymer matrix either occurs during the
shaping process or beforehand. In the first case, the starting materials arrive at the
fabricating operation as separate entities and are combined into the composite during
shaping. Examples of this case are filament winding and pultrusion. The starting reinforcement in these processes consists of continuous fibers. In the second case, the two
component materials are combined into some preliminary form that is convenient for use in
the shaping process. Nearly all of the thermoplastics and thermosets used in the plastic
shaping processes are really polymers combined with fillers (Section 8.1.5). The fillers are
either short fibers or particulate (including flakes).
Of greatest interest in this chapter are the starting forms used in processes designed
for FRP composites. We might think of the starting forms as prefabricated composites
that arrive ready for use at the shaping process. These forms are molding compounds and
prepregs.
Molding Compounds Molding compounds are similar to those used in plastic molding.
They are designed for use in molding operations, and so they must be capable of flowing.
Most molding compounds for composite processing are thermosetting polymers. Accordingly, they have not been cured before shape processing. Curing is done during and/or after
final shaping. FRP composite molding compounds consist of the resin matrix with short,
randomly dispersed fibers. They come in several forms.
Sheet molding compound (SMC) is a combination of TS polymer resin, fillers and
other additives, and chopped glass fibers (randomly oriented) all rolled into a sheet of
typical thickness ¼ 6.5 mm (0.250 in). The most common resin is unsaturated polyester;
fillers are usually mineral powders such as talc, silica, limestone; and the glass fibers are
typically 12 to 75 mm (0.5 to 3.0 in) long and account for about 30% of the SMC by
volume. SMCs are very convenient for handling and cutting to proper size as molding
charges. Sheet molding compounds are generally produced between thin layers of
polyethylene to limit evaporation of volatiles from the thermosetting resin. The protective coating also improves surface finish on subsequent molded parts. The process for
fabricating continuous SMC sheets is depicted in Figure 15.2.
Bulk molding compound (BMC) consists of similar ingredients as those in SMC,
but the compounded polymer is in billet form rather than sheet. The fibers in BMC are
shorter, typically 2 to 12 mm (0.1 to 0.5 in), because greater fluidity is required in
the molding operations for which these materials are designed. Billet diameter is usually

25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in). The process for producing BMC is similar to that for SMC, except
extrusion is used to obtain the final billet form. BMC is also known as dough molding
compound (DMC), because of its dough-like consistency. Other FRP molding compounds include thick molding compound (TMC), similar to SMC but thicker—up to 50
mm (2 in); and pelletized molding compounds—basically conventional plastic molding
compounds containing short fibers.
Prepregs Another prefabricated form for FRP shaping operations is prepreg, which
consists of fibers impregnated with partially cured thermosetting resins to facilitate shape
processing. Completion of curing must be accomplished during and/or after shaping.
Prepregs are available in the form of tapes or cross-plied sheets or fabrics. The advantage
of prepregs is that they are fabricated with continuous filaments rather than chopped
random fibers, thus increasing strength and modulus of the final product. Prepreg tapes and
sheets are associated with advanced composites (reinforced with boron, carbon/graphite,
and Kevlar) as well as fiberglass.

15.2

OPEN MOLD PROCESSES
The distinguishing feature of this family of FRP shaping processes is its use of a single
positive or negative mold surface (Figure 15.3) to produce laminated FRP structures.
Other names for open mold processes include contact lamination and contact molding.
The starting materials (resins, fibers, mats, and woven rovings) are applied to the mold in
layers, building up to the desired thickness. This is followed by curing and part removal.
Common resins are unsaturated polyesters and epoxies, using fiberglass as the reinforcement. The moldings are usually large (e.g., boat hulls). The advantage of using
an open mold is that the mold costs much less than if two matching molds were used. The
disadvantage is that only the part surface in contact with the mold surface is finished; the

other side is rough. For the best possible part surface on the finished side, the mold itself
must be very smooth.
There are several important open mold FRP processes. The differences are in the
methods of applying the laminations to the mold, alternative curing techniques, and other
variations. In this section we describe the family of open mold processes for shaping fiberreinforced plastics: (1) hand lay-up, (2) spray-up, (3) automated tape-laying machines,
and (4) bag molding. We treat hand lay-up as the base process and the others as
modifications and refinements.

15.2.1 HAND LAY-UP
Hand lay-up is the oldest open mold method for FRP laminates, dating to the 1940s when it
was first used to fabricate boat hulls. It is also the most labor-intensive method. As the name
suggests, hand lay-up is a shaping method in which successive layers of resin and
reinforcement are manually applied to an open mold to build the laminated FRP composite
structure. The basic procedure consists of five steps, illustrated in Figure 15.4. The finished
molding must usually be trimmed with a power saw to size the outside edges. In general,
these same five steps are required for all of the open mold processes; the differences
between methods occur in steps 3 and 4.
In step 3, each layer of fiber reinforcement is dry when placed onto the mold. The
liquid (uncured) resin is then applied by pouring, brushing, or spraying. Impregnation of
resin into the fiber mat or fabric is accomplished by hand rolling. This approach is referred
to as wet lay-up. An alternative approach is to use prepregs, in which the impregnated
layers of fiber reinforcement are first prepared outside the mold and then laid onto the
mold surface. Advantages cited for the prepregs include closer control over fiber–resin
mixture and more efficient methods of adding the laminations [11].
Molds for open mold contact laminating can be made of plaster, metal, glass fiberreinforced plastic, or other materials. Selection of material depends on economics, surface
quality, and other technical factors. For prototype fabrication, in which only one part is
produced, plaster molds are usually adequate. For medium quantities, the mold can be

surface of the molding;
(3) when the gel coat has
partially set, successive
layers of resin and fiber are
applied, the fiber being in
the form of mat or cloth;
each layer is rolled to fully
impregnate the fiber with
resin and remove air
bubbles; (4) the part is
cured; and (5) the fully
hardened part is removed
from the mold.

made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. High production generally requires metal molds.
Aluminum, steel, and nickel are used, sometimes with surface hardening on the mold face
to resist wear. An advantage of metal, in addition to durability, is its high thermal
conductivity that can be used to implement a heat-curing system, or simply to dissipate
heat from the laminate while it cures at room temperature.
Products suited to hand lay-up are generally large in size but low in production
quantity. In addition to boat hulls, other applications include swimming pools, large
container tanks, stage props, radomes, and other formed sheets. Automotive parts have
also been made, but the method is not economical for high production. The largest
moldings ever made by this process were ship hulls for the British Royal Navy: 85 m
(280 ft) long [2].

15.2.2 SPRAY-UP
This represents an attempt to mechanize the application of resin-fiber layers and reduce the
time for lay-up. It is an alternative for step 3 in the hand lay-up procedure. In the spray-up
method, liquid resin and chopped fibers are sprayed onto an open mold to build successive
FRP laminations, as in Figure 15.5. The spray gun is equipped with a chopper mechanism
that feeds in continuous filament rovings and cuts them into fibers of length 25 to 75 mm
(1 to 3 in) that are added to the resin stream as it exits the nozzle. The mixing action results in
random orientation of the fibers in the layer—unlike hand lay-up, in which the filaments
can be oriented if desired. Another difference is that the fiber content in spray-up is limited
to about 35% (compared with a maximum of around 65% in hand lay-up). This is a
shortcoming of the spraying and mixing process.
Spraying can be accomplished manually using a portable spray gun or by an automated
machine in which the path of the spray gun is preprogrammed and computer controlled. The
automated procedure is advantageous for labor efficiency and environmental protection.
Some of the volatile emissions from the liquid resins are hazardous, and the path-controlled
machines can operate in sealed-off areas without humans present. However, rolling is
generally required for each layer, as in hand lay-up.
Products made by the spray-up method include boat hulls, bathtubs, shower
stalls, automobile and truck body parts, recreational vehicle components, furniture,
large structural panels, and containers. Movie and stage props are sometimes made by
this method. Because products made by spray-up have randomly oriented short fibers,
they are not as strong as those made by lay-up, in which the fibers are continuous and
directed.

15.2.3 AUTOMATED TAPE-LAYING MACHINES
This is another attempt to automate and accelerate step 3 in the lay-up procedure.
Automated tape-laying machines operate by dispensing a prepreg tape onto an open
mold following a programmed path. The typical machine consists of an overhead gantry,
to which is attached the dispensing head, as shown in Figure 15.6. The gantry permits x-y-z
travel of the head, for positioning and following a defined continuous path. The head itself
has several rotational axes, plus a shearing device to cut the tape at the end of each path.
Prepreg tape widths are commonly 75 mm (3 in), although 300 mm (12 in) widths have been
reported [10]; thickness is around 0.13 mm (0.005 in). The tape is stored on the machine in
rolls, which are unwound and deposited along the defined path. Each lamination is placed
by following a series of back-and-forth passes across the mold surface until the parallel rows
of tape complete the layer.
Much of the work to develop automated tape-laying machines has been pioneered
by the aircraft industry, which is eager to save labor costs and at the same time achieve the
highest possible quality and uniformity in its manufactured components. The disadvantage of this and other computer numerically controlled machines is that it must
be programmed, and programming takes time.

15.2.4 CURING
Curing (step 4) is required of all thermosetting resins used in FRP laminated composites.
Curing accomplishes cross-linking of the polymer, transforming it from its liquid or
highly plastic condition into a hardened product. There are three principal process
parameters in curing: time, temperature, and pressure.
Curing normally occurs at room temperature for the TS resins used in hand lay-up
and spray-up procedures. Moldings made by these processes are often large (e.g., boat
hulls), and heating would be difficult for such parts. In some cases, days are required
before room temperature curing is sufficiently complete to remove the part. If feasible,
heat is added to speed the curing reaction.

Section 15.3/Closed Mold Processes

335

Heating is accomplished by several means. Oven curing provides heat at closely
controlled temperatures; some curing ovens are equipped to draw a partial vacuum.
Infrared heating can be used in applications in which it is impractical or inconvenient to
place the molding in an oven.
Curing in an autoclave provides control over both temperature and pressure. An
autoclave is an enclosed chamber equipped to apply heat and/or pressure at controlled
levels. In FRP composites processing, it is usually a large horizontal cylinder with doors at
either end. The term autoclave molding is sometimes used to refer to the curing of a
prepreg laminate in an autoclave. This procedure is used extensively in the aerospace
industry to produce advanced composite components of very high quality.

15.3

CLOSED MOLD PROCESSES
These molding operations are performed in molds consisting of two sections that open and
close during each molding cycle. The name matched die molding is used for some of these
processes. One might think that a closed mold is about twice the cost of a comparable open
mold. However, tooling cost is even greater owing to the more complex equipment required
in these processes. Despite their higher cost, advantages of a closed mold are (1) good finish
on all part surfaces, (2) higher production rates,
(3) closer control over tolerances, and
(4) more complex three-dimensional shapes are possible.
We divide the closed mold processes into three classes based on their counterparts
in conventional plastic molding, even though the terminology is often different when
polymer matrix composites are molded: (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding,
and (3) injection molding.

15.3.1 COMPRESSION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES
In compression molding of conventional molding compounds (Section 13.7.1), a charge is
placed in the lower mold section, and the sections are brought together under pressure,
causing the charge to take the shape of the cavity. The mold halves are heated to cure the
thermosetting polymer. When the molding is sufficiently cured, the mold is opened and
the part is removed. There are several shaping processes for PMCs based on compression
molding; the differences are mostly in the form of the starting materials. The flow of the
resin, fibers, and other ingredients during the process is a critical factor in compression
molding of FRP composites.
SMC, TMC, and BMC Molding Several of the FRP molding compounds, namely sheet
molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC), and thick molding compound (TMC), can be cut to proper size and used as the starting charge in compression
molding. Refrigeration is often required to store these materials prior to shape processing. The names of the molding processes are based on the starting molding compound
(i.e., SMC molding is when the starting charge is precut sheet molding compound; BMC
molding uses BMC cut to size as the charge; and so on).
Preform Molding Another form of compression molding, called preform molding [11],
involves placement of a precut mat into the lower mold section along with a polymer
resin charge (e.g., pellets or sheet). The materials are then pressed between heated mold
halves, causing the resin to flow and impregnate the fiber mat to produce a fiber
reinforced molding. Variations of the process use either thermoplastic or thermosetting
polymers.

FIGURE 15.7 Elastic reservoir molding: (1) foam is placed into mold between two fiber layers; (2) mold is closed,
releasing resin from foam into fiber layers.

Elastic Reservoir Molding The starting charge in elastic reservoir molding (ERM) is a
sandwich consisting of a center of polymer foam between two dry fiber layers. The foam
core is commonly open-cell polyurethane, impregnated with liquid resin such as epoxy or
polyester, and the dry fiber layers can be cloth, woven roving, or other starting fibrous
form. As depicted in Figure 15.7, the sandwich is placed in the lower mold section and
pressed at moderate pressure—around 0.7 MPa (100 lb/in2). As the core is compressed, it
releases the resin to wet the dry surface layers. Curing produces a lightweight part
consisting of a low-density core and thin FRP skins.

15.3.2 TRANSFER MOLDING PMC PROCESSES
In conventional transfer molding (Section 13.7.2), a charge of thermosetting resin is
placed in a pot or chamber, heated, and squeezed by ram action into one or more mold
cavities. The mold is heated to cure the resin. The name of the process derives from the
fact that the fluid polymer is transferred from the pot into the mold. It can be used to
mold TS resins in which the fillers include short fibers to produce an FRP composite part.
Another form of transfer molding for PMCs is called resin transfer molding (RTM) [4],
[11]; it refers to a closed mold process in which a preform mat is placed in the lower mold
section, the mold is closed, and a thermosetting resin (e.g., polyester resin) is transferred
into the cavity under moderate pressure to impregnate the preform. To confuse matters,
RTM is sometimes called resin injection molding [4], [13]. (The distinction between
transfer molding and injection molding is blurry anyway, as the reader may have noted in
Chapter 13.) RTM has been used to manufacture such products as bathtubs, swimming
pool shells, bench and chair seats, and hulls for small boats.
Several enhancements of the basic RTM process have been developed [5]. One
enhancement, called advanced RTM, uses high-strength polymers such as epoxy resins and
continuous fiber reinforcement instead of mats. Applications include aerospace components, missile fins, and snow skis. Two additional processes are thermal expansion resin
transfer molding and ultimately reinforced thermoset resin injection. Thermal expansion
resin transfer molding (TERTM) is a patented process of TERTM, Inc. that consists of the
following steps [5]: (1) A rigid polymer foam (e.g., polyurethane) is shaped into a preform.
(2) The preform is enclosed in a fabric reinforcement and placed in a closed mold. (3) A
thermosetting resin (e.g., epoxy) is injected into the mold to impregnate the fabric and
surround the foam. (4) The mold is heated to expand the foam, fill the mold cavity, and
cure the resin. Ultimately, reinforced thermoset resin injection (URTRI) is similar to
TERTM except that the starting foam core is cast epoxy embedded with miniature hollow
glass spheres.

15.3.3 INJECTION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES
Injection molding is noted for low-cost production of plastic parts in large quantities.
Although it is most closely associated with thermoplastics, the process can also be
adapted to thermosets (Section 13.6.5).
Conventional Injection Molding In PMC shape processing, injection molding is used
for both TP- and TS-type FRPs. In the TP category, virtually all thermoplastic polymers
can be reinforced with fibers. Chopped fibers must be used; if continuous fibers were
used, they would be reduced anyway by the action of the rotating screw in the barrel.
During injection from the chamber into the mold cavity, the fibers tend to become
aligned during their journey through the nozzle. Designers can sometimes exploit this
feature to optimize directional properties through part design, location of gates, and
cavity orientation relative to the gate [8].
Whereas TP molding compounds are heated and then injected into a cold mold, TS
polymers are injected into a heated mold for curing. Control of the process with
thermosets is trickier because of the risk of premature cross-linking in the injection
chamber. Subject to the same risk, injection molding can be applied to fiber-reinforced
TS plastics in the form of pelletized molding compound and dough molding compound.
Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding Some thermosets cure by chemical reaction
rather than heat; these resins can be molded by reaction injection molding (Section
13.6.5). In RIM, two reactive ingredients are mixed and immediately injected into a mold
cavity where curing and solidification of the chemicals occur rapidly. A closely related
process includes reinforcing fibers, typically glass, in the mixture. In this case, the process
is called reinforced reaction injection molding (RRIM). Its advantages are similar to
those in RIM, with the added benefit of fiber reinforcement. RRIM is used extensively in
auto body and truck cab applications for bumpers, fenders, and other body parts.

15.4

FILAMENT WINDING
Filament winding is a process in which resin-impregnated continuous fibers are wrapped
around a rotating mandrel that has the internal shape of the desired FRP product. The resin
is subsequently cured and the mandrel removed. Hollow axisymmetric components
(usually circular in cross section) are produced, as well as some irregular shapes. The
most common form of the process is depicted in Figure 15.8. A band of fiber rovings is
pulled through a resin bath immediately before being wound in a helical pattern onto a
cylindrical mandrel. Continuation of the winding pattern finally completes a surface layer
of one filament thickness on the mandrel. The operation is repeated to form additional
layers, each having a criss-cross pattern with the previous, until the desired part thickness
has been obtained.
There are several methods by which the fibers can be impregnated with resin:
(1) wet winding, in which the filament is pulled through the liquid resin just before winding, as in the figure; (2) prepreg winding (also called dry winding), in which filaments
preimpregnated with partially cured resin are wrapped around a heated mandrel; and
(3) postimpregnation, in which filaments are wound onto a mandrel and then impregnated with resin by brushing or other technique.
Two basic winding patterns are used in filament winding: (a) helical and (b) polar
(Figure 15.9). In helical winding, the filament band is applied in a spiral pattern around
the mandrel, at a helix angle u. If the band is wrapped with a helix angle approaching 90 , so
that the winding advance is one bandwidth per revolution (and the filaments form nearly

circular rings around the mandrel), this is referred to as a hoop winding; it is a special case
of helical winding. In polar winding, the filament is wrapped around the long axis of the
mandrel, as in Figure 15.9(b); after each longitudinal revolution, the mandrel is indexed
(partially rotated) by one bandwidth, so that a hollow enclosed shape is gradually created.
Hoop and polar patterns can be combined in successive windings of the mandrel to
produce adjacent layers with filament directions that are approximately perpendicular;
this is called a bi-axial winding [2].
Filament winding machines have motion capabilities similar to those of an engine
lathe (Section 22.2.3). The typical machine has a drive motor to rotate the mandrel and a
powered feed mechanism to move the carriage. Relative motion between mandrel and
carriage must be controlled to accomplish a given winding pattern. In helical winding, the
relationship between helix angle and the machine parameters can be expressed as follows:
tan u ¼

vc
pDN

ð15:1Þ

where u ¼ helix angle of the windings on the mandrel, as in Figure 15.9(a); vc ¼ speed at
which the carriage traverses in the axial direction, m/s (in/sec); D ¼ diameter of the
mandrel, m (in); and N ¼ rotational speed, 1/s (rev/sec).
Various types of control are available in filament winding machines. Modern
equipment uses computer numerical control (CNC, Section 38.3), in which mandrel
rotation and carriage speed are independently controlled to permit greater adjustment
and flexibility in the relative motions. CNC is especially useful in helical winding of
contoured shapes, as in Figure 15.10. As indicated in Eq. (15.1), the ratio vc/DN must
remain fixed to maintain a constant helix angle u. Thus, either vc and/or N must be
adjusted on-line to compensate for changes in D.
The mandrel is the special tooling that determines the geometry of the filamentwound part. For part removal, mandrels must be capable of collapsing after winding and
curing. Various designs are possible, including inflatable/deflatable mandrels, collapsible
metal mandrels, and mandrels made of soluble salts or plasters.

Applications of filament winding are often classified as aerospace or commercial [10],
the engineering requirements being more demanding in the first category. Aerospace
applications include rocket-motor cases, missile bodies, radomes, helicopter blades, and
airplane tail sections and stabilizers. These components are made of advanced composites
and hybrid composites (Section 9.4.1), with epoxy resins being most common and reinforced
with fibers of carbon, boron, Kevlar, and glass. Commercial applications include storage
tanks, reinforced pipes and tubing, drive shafts, wind-turbine blades, and lightning rods; these
are made of conventional FRPs. Polymers include polyester, epoxy, and phenolic resins; glass
is the common reinforcing fiber.

15.5

PULTRUSION PROCESSES
The basic pultrusion process was developed around 1950 for making fishing rods of glass
fiber–reinforced polymer (GFRP). The process is similar to extrusion (hence the
similarity in name), but it involves pulling of the workpiece (so the prefix ‘‘pul-’’ is
used in place of ‘‘ex-’’). Like extrusion, pultrusion produces continuous, straight sections
of constant cross section. A related process, called pulforming, can be used to make parts
that are curved and may have variations in cross section throughout their lengths.

15.5.1 PULTRUSION
Pultrusion is a process in which continuous fiber rovings are dipped into a resin bath and
pulled through a shaping die where the impregnated resin cures. The setup is sketched in
Figure15.11,whichshowsthecuredproductbeingcutintolong,straightsections.Thesections
are reinforced throughout their length by continuous fibers. Like extrusion, the pieces have a
constant cross section, whose profile is determined by the shape of the die opening.
The process consists of five steps (identified in the sketch) performed in a
continuous sequence [2]: (1) filament feeding, in which the fibers are unreeled from

sequence numbers).

a creel (shelves with skewers that hold filament bobbins); (2) resin impregnation, in
which the fibers are dipped in the uncured liquid resin; (3) pre-die forming—the
collection of filaments is gradually shaped into the approximate cross section desired;
(4) shaping and curing, in which the impregnated fibers are pulled through the heated die
whose length is 1 to 1.5 m (3 to 5 ft) and whose inside surfaces are highly polished; and (5)
pulling and cutting—pullers are used to draw the cured length through the die, after which
it is cut by a cut-off wheel with SiC or diamond grits.
Common resins used in pultrusion are unsaturated polyesters, epoxies, and silicones,
all thermosetting polymers. There are difficulties in processing with epoxy polymers
because of sticking on the die surface. Thermoplastics have also been studied for possible
applications [2]. E-glass is by far the most widely used reinforcing material; proportions
range from 30% to 70%. Modulus of elasticity and tensile strength increase with
reinforcement content. Products made by pultrusion include solid rods, tubing, long
and flat sheets, structural sections (such as channels, angled and flanged beams), tool
handles for high-voltage work, and third-rail covers for subways.

15.5.2 PULFORMING
The pultrusion process is limited to straight sections of constant cross section. There is also a
need for long parts with continuous fiber reinforcement that are curved rather than straight
and whose cross sections may vary throughout the length. The pulforming process is suited
to these less-regular shapes. Pulforming can be defined as pultrusion with additional steps to
form the length into a semicircular contour and alter the cross section at one or more
locations along the length. A sketch of the equipment is illustrated in Figure 15.12. After
exiting the shaping die, the continuous workpiece is fed into a rotating table with negative
molds positioned around its periphery. The work is forced into the mold cavities by a
die shoe, which squeezes the cross section at various locations and forms the curvature in the
length. The diameter of the table determines the radius of the part. As the work leaves
the die table, it is cut to length to provide discrete parts. Resins and fibers similar to those for
pultrusion are used in pulforming. An important application of the process is production of
automobile leaf springs.

15.6

OTHER PMC SHAPING PROCESSES
Additional PMC shaping processes worth noting include centrifugal casting, tube rolling,
continuous laminating, and cutting. In addition, many of the traditional thermoplastic
shaping processes are applicable to (short-fiber) FRPs based on TP polymers; these
include blow molding, thermoforming, and extrusion.
Centrifugal Casting This process is ideal for cylindrical products such as pipes and
tanks. The process is the same as its counterpart in metal casting (Section 11.3.5).
Chopped fibers combined with liquid resin are poured into a fast-rotating cylindrical
mold. Centrifugal force presses the ingredients against the mold wall, where curing takes
place. The resulting inner surfaces are quite smooth. Part shrinkage or use of split molds
permits part removal.
Tube Rolling FRP tubes can be fabricated from prepreg sheets by a rolling technique [7],
shown in Figure 15.13. Such tubes are used in bicycle frames and space trusses. In the process,
a precut prepreg sheet is wrapped around a cylindrical mandrel several times to obtain a tube
wall of multiple sheet thicknesses. The rolled sheets are then encased in a heat-shrinking
sleeve and oven cured. As the sleeve contracts, entrapped gases are squeezed out the ends of
the tube. When curing is complete, the mandrel is removed to yield a rolled FRP tube. The
operation is simple, and tooling cost is low. There are variations in the process, such as using
different wrapping methods or using a steel mold to enclose the rolled prepreg tube for better
dimensional control.

Chapter 15/Shaping Processes for Polymer Matrix Composites

Continuous Laminating Fiber-reinforced plastic panels, sometimes translucent and/or
corrugated, are used in construction. The process to produce them consists of (1)
impregnating layers of glass fiber mat or woven fabric by dipping in liquid resin or
by passing beneath a doctor blade; (2) gathering between cover films (cellophane,
polyester, or other polymer); and (3) compacting between squeeze rolls and curing.
Corrugation (4) is added by formed rollers or mold shoes.
Cutting Methods FRP laminated composites must be cut in both uncured and cured
states. Uncured materials (prepregs, preforms, SMCs, and other starting forms) must be cut
to size for lay-up, molding, and so on. Typical cutting tools include knives, scissors, power
shears, and steel-rule blanking dies. Also used are nontraditional cutting methods, such as
laser beam cutting and water jet cutting (Chapter 26).
Cured FRPs are hard, tough, abrasive, and difficult to cut; but cutting is necessary
in many FRP shaping processes to trim excess material, cut holes and outlines, and for
other purposes. For fiberglass-reinforced plastics, cemented carbide cutting tools and
high-speed steel saw blades must be used. For some advanced composites (e.g., boronepoxy), diamond cutting tools obtain best results. Water jet cutting is also used with good
success on cured FRPs; this process reduces the dust and noise problems associated with
conventional sawing methods.

This part of the book is concerned with the processing of
metals and ceramics that are in the form of powders—very
small particulate solids. In the case of traditional ceramics,
the powders are produced by crushing and grinding common
materials that are found in nature, such as silicate minerals
(clay) and quartz. In the case of metals and the new ceramics,
the powders are produced by a variety of industrial processes.
We cover the powder-making processes as well as the methods used to shape products out of powders in two chapters:
Chapter 16 on powder metallurgy and Chapter 17 on particulate processing of ceramics and cermets.
Powder metallurgy (PM) is a metal processing technology in which parts are produced from metallic powders.
In the usual PM production sequence, the powders are
compressed into the desired shape and then heated to cause
bonding of the particles into a hard, rigid mass. Compression, called pressing, is accomplished in a press-type machine using tools designed specifically for the part to be
manufactured. The tooling, which typically consists of a die
and one or more punches, can be expensive, and PM is
therefore most appropriate for medium and high production. The heating treatment, called sintering, is performed
at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. The
video clip titled Powder Metallurgy illustrates PM

production technology. Considerations that make powder metallurgy an important
commercial technology include:
å PM parts can be mass produced to net shape or near net shape, eliminating or
reducing the need for subsequent processing.
å The PM process itself involves very little waste of material; about 97% of the
starting powders are converted to product. This compares favorably with casting
processes in which sprues, runners, and risers are wasted material in the production
cycle.
å Owing to the nature of the starting material in PM, parts having a specified level of
porosity can be made. This feature lends itself to the production of porous metal parts
such as filters and oil-impregnated bearings and gears.
å Certain metals that are difficult to fabricate by other methods can be shaped by
powder metallurgy. Tungsten is an example; tungsten filaments used in incandescent
lamp bulbs are made using PM technology.
å Certain metal alloy combinations and cermets can be formed by PM that cannot be
produced by other methods.
å PM compares favorably with most casting processes in terms of dimensional control
of the product. Tolerances of 0.13 mm (0.005 in) are held routinely.
å PM production methods can be automated for economical production.
VIDEO CLIP
Powder Metallurgy. This clip contains two segments: (1) powder metal parts production
and (2) PM overview.

There are limitations and disadvantages associated with PM processing. These
include the following: (1) tooling and equipment costs are high, (2) metallic powders are
expensive, and (3) there are difficulties with storing and handling metal powders (such as
degradation of the metal over time, and fire hazards with particular metals). Also, (4)
there are limitations on part geometry because metal powders do not readily flow
laterally in the die during pressing, and allowances must be provided for ejection of the
part from the die after pressing. In addition, (5) variations in material density throughout
the part may be a problem in PM, especially for complex part geometries.
Although parts as large as 22 kg (50 lb) can be produced, most PM components are
less than 2.2 kg (5 lb). A collection of typical PM parts is shown in Figure 16.1. The largest
tonnage of metals for PM are alloys of iron, steel, and aluminum. Other PM metals
include copper, nickel, and refractory metals such as molybdenum and tungsten. Metallic
carbides such as tungsten carbide are often included within the scope of powder
metallurgy; however, because these materials are ceramics, we defer their consideration
until the next chapter.
The development of the modern field of powder metallurgy dates back to the 1800s
(Historical Note 16.1). The scope of the modern technology includes not only parts
production, but also preparation of the starting powders. Success in powder metallurgy
depends to a large degree on the characteristics of the starting powders; we discuss this topic
in Section 16.1. Later sections describe powder production, pressing, and sintering. There is
a close correlation between PM technology and aspects of ceramics processing (Chapter 17). In ceramics (except glass), the starting material is also powder, so the methods for
characterizing the powders are closely related to those in PM. Several of the shape-forming
methods are similar, also.

P

Powder metallurgy

owders of metals such as gold and copper, as well
as some of the metallic oxides, have been used for
decorative purposes since ancient times. The uses
included decorations on pottery, bases for paints, and in
cosmetics. It is believed that the Egyptians used PM to
make tools as far back as 3000 BCE.
The modern field of powder metallurgy dates to the
early nineteenth century, when there was a strong
interest in the metal platinum. Around 1815, Englishman
William Wollaston developed a technique for preparing
platinum powders, compacting them under high
pressure, and baking (sintering) them at red heat. The
Wollaston process marks the beginning of powder
metallurgy as it is practiced today.
U.S. patents were issued in 1870 to S. Gwynn that
relate to PM self-lubricating bearings. He used a mixture
of 99% powdered tin and 1% petroleum, mixing,
heating, and finally subjecting the mixture to extreme
pressures to form it into the desired shape inside a mold
cavity.
By the early 1900s, the incandescent lamp had
become an important commercial product. A variety

of filament materials had been tried, including
carbon, zirconium, vanadium, and osmium; but it was
concluded that tungsten was the best filament
material. The problem was that tungsten was difficult
to process because of its high melting point and
unique properties. In 1908, William Coolidge
developed a procedure that made production of
tungsten incandescent lamp filaments feasible. In his
process, fine powders of tungsten oxide (WO3) were
reduced to metallic powders, pressed into compacts,
presintered, hot-forged into rounds, sintered, and
finally drawn into filament wire. The Coolidge process
is still used today to make filaments for incandescent
light bulbs.
In the 1920s, cemented carbide tools (WC–Co) were
being fabricated by PM techniques (Historical Note 7.2).
Self-lubricating bearings were produced in large
quantities starting in the 1930s. Powder metal gears and
other components were mass produced in the 1960s and
1970s, especially in the automotive industry; and in the
1980s, PM parts for aircraft turbine engines were
developed.

CHARACTERIZATION OF ENGINEERING POWDERS
A powder can be defined as a finely divided particulate solid. In this section we
characterize metallic powders. However, most of the discussion applies to ceramic
powders as well.

16.1.1 GEOMETRIC FEATURES
The geometry of the individual powders can be defined by the following attributes: (1)
particle size and distribution, (2) particle shape and internal structure, and (3) surface area.
Particle Size and Distribution Particle size refers to the dimensions of the individual
powders. If the particle shape is spherical, a single dimension is adequate. For other
shapes, two or more dimensions are needed. There are various methods available to
obtain particle size data. The most common method uses screens of different mesh sizes.
The term mesh count is used to refer to the number of openings per linear inch of screen.
Higher mesh count indicates smaller particle size. A mesh count of 200 means there are
200 openings per linear inch. Because the mesh is square, the count is the same in both
directions, and the total number of openings per square inch is 2002 ¼ 40,000.
Particles are sorted by passing them through a series of screens of progressively
smaller mesh size. The powders are placed on a screen of a certain mesh count and
vibrated so that particles small enough to fit through the openings pass through to the
next screen below. The second screen empties into a third, and so forth, so that the
particles are sorted according to size. A certain powder size might be called size 230
through 200, indicating that the powders have passed through the 200 mesh, but not
230. To make the specification easier, we simply say that the particle size is 200. The
procedure of separating the powders by size is called classification.
The openings in the screen are less than the reciprocal of the mesh count because of
the thickness of the wire in the screen, as illustrated in Figure 16.2. Assuming that the
limiting dimension of the particle is equal to the screen opening, we have
1
PS ¼
ð16:1Þ
 tw
MC
where PS ¼ particle size, in; MC ¼ mesh count, openings per linear inch; and tw ¼ wire
thickness of screen mesh, in.
The figure shows how smaller particles would pass through the openings, whereas
larger powders would not. Variations occur in the powder sizes sorted by screening owing
to differences in particle shapes, the range of sizes between mesh count steps, and
variations in screen openings within a given mesh count. Also, the screening method has a

sizes.

practical upper limit of MC ¼ 400 (approximately), because of both the difficulty in
making such fine screens and agglomeration of the small powders. Other methods to
measure particle size include microscopy and X-ray techniques.
Typical particle sizes used in conventional powder metallurgy (press and sinter)
range between 25 and 300 mm (0.001 and 0.012 in).1 The high end of this range corresponds
to a mesh count of around 65. The low end of the range is too small to be measured by the
mesh count method.
Particle Shape and Internal Structure Metal powder shapes can be cataloged into
various types, several of which are illustrated in Figure 16.3. There will be a variation in the
particle shapes in a collection of powders, just as the particle size will vary. A simple and
useful measure of shape is the aspect ratio—the ratio of maximum dimension to minimum
dimension for a given particle. The aspect ratio for a spherical particle is 1.0, but for an
acicular grain the ratio might be 2 to 4. Microscopic techniques are required to determine
shape characteristics.
Any volume of loose powders will contain pores between the particles. These are
called open pores because they are external to the individual particles. Open pores are
spaces into which a fluid such as water, oil, or a molten metal can penetrate. In addition,
there are closed pores—internal voids in the structure of an individual particle. The
existence of these internal pores is usually minimal, and their effect when they do exist is
minor, but they can influence density measurements, as we shall see later.
Surface Area Assuming that the particle shape is a perfect sphere, its area A and
volume V are given by
A ¼ pD2

where D ¼ diameter of the spherical particle, mm (in). The area-to-volume ratio A/V for
a sphere is then given by

where Ks ¼ shape factor; D in the general case ¼ the diameter of a sphere of equivalent
volume as the nonspherical particle, mm (in).
Thus, Ks ¼ 6.0 for a sphere. For particle shapes other than spherical, Ks > 6.
We can infer the following from these equations. Smaller particle size and higher
shape factor (Ks) mean higher surface area for the same total weight of metal powders.
This means greater area for surface oxidation to occur. Small powder size also leads to
more agglomeration of the particles, which is a problem in automatic feeding of the
powders. The reason for using smaller particle sizes is that they provide more uniform
shrinkage and better mechanical properties in the final PM product.

16.1.2 OTHER FEATURES
Other features of engineering powders include interparticle friction, flow characteristics,
packing, density, porosity, chemistry, and surface films.
Interparticle Friction and Flow Characteristics Friction between particles affects the
ability of a powder to flow readily and pack tightly. A common measure of interparticle
friction is the angle of repose, which is the angle formed by a pile of powders as they are
poured from a narrow funnel, as in Figure 16.4. Larger angles indicate greater friction
between particles. Smaller particle sizes generally show greater friction and steeper
angles. Spherical shapes result in the lowest interpartical friction; as shape deviates more
from spherical, friction between particles tends to increase.
Flow characteristics are important in die filling and pressing. Automatic die filling
depends on easy and consistent flow of the powders. In pressing, resistance to flow increases
density variations in the compacted part; these density gradients are generally undesirable.
A common measure of flow is the time required for a certain amount of powder (by weight)
to flow through a standard-sized funnel. Smaller flow times indicate easier flow and lower
interparticle friction. To reduce interparticle friction and facilitate flow during pressing,
lubricants are often added to the powders in small amounts.
Packing, Density, and Porosity Packing characteristics depend on two density measures. First, true density is the density of the true volume of the material. This is the
density when the powders are melted into a solid mass, values of which are given in Table
4.1. Second, bulk density is the density of the powders in the loose state after pouring,
which includes the effect of pores between particles. Because of the pores, bulk density is
less than true density.
The packing factor is the bulk density divided by the true density. Typical values for
loose powders range between 0.5 and 0.7. The packing factor depends on particle shape and

FIGURE 16.4 Interparticle friction as
indicated by the angle of repose of a pile
of powders poured from a narrow funnel.
Larger angles indicate greater
interparticle friction.

E1C16

Chapter 16/Powder Metallurgy

the distribution of particle sizes. If powders of various sizes are present, the smaller powders
will fit into the interstices of the larger ones that would otherwise be taken up by air, thus
resulting in a higher packing factor. Packing can also be increased by vibrating the powders,
causing them to settle more tightly. Finally, we should note that external pressure, as applied
during compaction, greatly increases packing of powders through rearrangement and
deformation of the particles.
Porosity represents an alternative way of considering the packing characteristics of
a powder. Porosity is defined as the ratio of the volume of the pores (empty spaces) in the
powder to the bulk volume. In principle
Porosity þ Packing factor ¼ 1:0

ð16:6Þ

The issue is complicated by the possible existence of closed pores in some of the
particles. If these internal pore volumes are included in the above porosity, then the
equation is exact.
Chemistry and Surface Films Characterization of the powder would not be complete
without an identification of its chemistry. Metallic powders are classified as either
elemental, consisting of a pure metal, or pre-alloyed, wherein each particle is an alloy.
We discuss these classes and the metals commonly used in PM more thoroughly in
Section 16.5.1.
Surface films are a problem in powder metallurgy because of the large area per unit
weight of metal when dealing with powders. The possible films include oxides, silica,
adsorbed organic materials, and moisture [6]. Generally, these films must be removed
before shape processing.

16.2 PRODUCTION OF METALLIC POWDERS
In general, producers of metallic powders are not the same companies as those that make
PM parts. The powder producers are the suppliers; the plants that manufacture components out of powder metals are the customers. It is therefore appropriate to separate the
discussion of powder production (this section) from the processes used to make PM
products (later sections).
Virtually any metal can be made into powder form. There are three principal
methods by which metallic powders are commercially produced, each of which involves
energy input to increase the surface area of the metal. The methods are (1) atomization, (2)
chemical, and (3) electrolytic [13]. In addition, mechanical methods are occasionally used
to reduce powder sizes; however, these methods are much more commonly associated with
ceramic powder production and we treat them in the next chapter.

16.2.1 ATOMIZATION
This method involves the conversion of molten metal into a spray of droplets that solidify into
powders. It is the most versatile and popular method for producing metal powders today,
applicable to almost all metals, alloys as well as pure metals. There are multiple ways of
creating the molten metal spray, several of which are illustrated in Figure 16.5. Two of the
methods shown are based on gas atomization, in which a high velocity gas stream (air or inert
gas) is utilized to atomize the liquid metal. In Figure 16.5(a), the gas flows through an
expansion nozzle, siphoning molten metal from the melt below and spraying it into a
container. The droplets solidify into powder form. In a closely related method shown in
Figure 16.5(b), molten metal flows by gravity through a nozzle and is immediately atomized

by air jets. The resulting metal powders, which tend to be spherical, are collected in a chamber
below.
The approach shown in Figure 16.5(c) is similar to (b), except that a high-velocity
water stream is used instead of air. This is known as water atomization and is the most
common of the atomization methods, particularly suited to metals that melt below
1600 C (2900 F). Cooling is more rapid, and the resulting powder shape is irregular
rather than spherical. The disadvantage of using water is oxidation on the particle surface.
A recent innovation involves the use of synthetic oil rather than water to reduce
oxidation. In both air and water atomization processes, particle size is controlled largely
by the velocity of the fluid stream; particle size is inversely related to velocity.
Several methods are based on centrifugal atomization. In one approach, the
rotating disk method shown in Figure 16.5(d), the liquid metal stream pours onto a
rapidly rotating disk that sprays the metal in all directions to produce powders.

16.2.2 OTHER PRODUCTION METHODS
Other metal powder production methods include various chemical reduction processes,
precipitation methods, and electrolysis.
Chemical reduction includes a variety of chemical reactions by which metallic
compounds are reduced to elemental metal powders. A common process involves liberation
of metals from their oxides by use of reducing agents such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide.
The reducing agent is made to combine with the oxygen in the compound to free the

metallic element. This approach is used to produce powders of iron, tungsten, and copper.
Another chemical process for iron powders involves the decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(Co)5) to produce spherical particles of high purity. Powders produced by this
method are illustrated in the photomicrograph of Figure 16.6. Other chemical processes
include precipitation of metallic elements from salts dissolved in water. Powders of copper,
nickel, and cobalt can be produced by this approach.
In electrolysis, an electrolytic cell is set up in which the source of the desired metal
is the anode. The anode is slowly dissolved under an applied voltage, transported through
the electrolyte, and deposited on the cathode. The deposit is removed, washed, and dried
to yield a metallic powder of very high purity. The technique is used for producing
powders of beryllium, copper, iron, silver, tantalum, and titanium.

16.3 CONVENTIONAL PRESSING AND SINTERING
After the metallic powders have been produced, the conventional PM sequence consists
of three steps: (1) blending and mixing of the powders; (2) compaction, in which the
powders are pressed into the desired part shape; and (3) sintering, which involves heating
to a temperature below the melting point to cause solid-state bonding of the particles and
strengthening of the part. The three steps, sometimes referred to as primary operations in
PM, are portrayed in Figure 16.7. In addition, secondary operations are sometimes
performed to improve dimensional accuracy, increase density, and for other reasons.

16.3.1 BLENDING AND MIXING OF THE POWDERS
To achieve successful results in compaction and sintering, the metallic powders must be
thoroughly homogenized beforehand. The terms blending and mixing are both used in this
context. Blending refers to when powders of the same chemical composition but possibly
different particle sizes are intermingled. Different particle sizes are often blended to reduce
porosity. Mixing refers to powders of different chemistries being combined. An advantage
of PM technology is the opportunity to mix various metals into alloys that would be difficult
or impossible to produce by other means. The distinction between blending and mixing is
not always precise in industrial practice.
Blending and mixing are accomplished by mechanical means. Four alternatives are
illustrated in Figure 16.8: (a) rotation in a drum; (b) rotation in a double-cone container;

(c) agitation in a screw mixer; and (d) stirring in a blade mixer. There is more science to
these devices than one would suspect. Best results seem to occur when the container is
between 20% and 40% full. The containers are usually designed with internal baffles or
other ways of preventing free-fall during blending of powders of different sizes, because
variations in settling rates between sizes result in segregation—just the opposite of what
is wanted in blending. Vibration of the powder is undesirable, because it also causes
segregation.
Other ingredients are usually added to the metallic powders during the blending and/
or mixing step. These additives include (1) lubricants, such as stearates of zinc and
aluminum, in small amounts to reduce friction between particles and at the die wall during
compaction; (2) binders, which are required in some cases to achieve adequate strength in
the pressed but unsintered parts; and (3) deflocculants, which inhibit agglomeration of
powders for better flow characteristics during subsequent processing.

16.3.2 COMPACTION
In compaction, high pressure is applied to the powders to form them into the required
shape. The conventional compaction method is pressing, in which opposing punches
squeeze the powders contained in a die. The steps in the pressing cycle are shown in
Figure 16.9. The workpart after pressing is called a green compact, the word green
meaning not yet fully processed. As a result of pressing, the density of the part, called the
green density, is much greater than the starting bulk density. The green strength of the
part when pressed is adequate for handling but far less than that achieved after sintering.
The applied pressure in compaction results initially in repacking of the powders into
a more efficient arrangement, eliminating ‘‘bridges’’ formed during filling, reducing pore
space, and increasing the number of contacting points between particles. As pressure
increases, the particles are plastically deformed, causing interparticle contact area to
increase and additional particles to make contact. This is accompanied by a further
reduction in pore volume. The progression is illustrated in three views in Figure 16.10

the three views as a function of applied pressure.
Presses used in conventional PM compaction are mechanical, hydraulic, or a
combination of the two. A 450 kN (50 ton) hydraulic unit is shown in Figure 16.11. Because
of differences in part complexity and associated pressing requirements, presses can be
distinguished as (1) pressing from one direction, referred to as single-action presses; or (2)
pressing from two directions, any of several types including opposed ram, double-action,
and multiple action. Current available press technology can provide up to 10 separate
action controls to produce parts of significant geometric complexity. We examine part
complexity and other design issues in Section 16.6.
The capacity of a press for PM production is generally given in tons or kN or MN.
The required force for pressing depends on the projected area of the PM part (area in the
horizontal plane for a vertical press) multiplied by the pressure needed to compact the
given metal powders. Reducing this to equation form
F ¼ Ap pc

ð16:7Þ

where F ¼ required force, N (lb); Ap ¼ projected area of the part, mm2 (in2); and pc ¼
compaction pressure required for the given powder material, MPa (lb/in2).
Compaction pressures typically range from 70 MPa (10,000 lb/in2) for aluminum
powders to 700 MPa (100,000 lb/in2) for iron and steel powders.

16.3.3 SINTERING
After pressing, the green compact lacks strength and hardness; it is easily crumbled under
low stresses. Sintering is a heat treatment operation performed on the compact to bond

its metallic particles, thereby increasing strength and hardness. The treatment is usually
carried out at temperatures between 0.7 and 0.9 of the metal’s melting point (absolute
scale). The terms solid-state sintering or solid-phase sintering are sometimes used for
this conventional sintering because the metal remains unmelted at these treatment
temperatures.
It is generally agreed among researchers that the primary driving force for sintering
is reduction of surface energy [6], [16]. The green compact consists of many distinct
particles, each with its own individual surface, and so the total surface area contained in
the compact is very high. Under the influence of heat, the surface area is reduced through
the formation and growth of bonds between the particles, with associated reduction in
surface energy. The finer the initial powder size, the higher the total surface area, and the
greater the driving force behind the process.
The series of sketches in Figure 16.12 shows on a microscopic scale the changes that
occur during sintering of metallic powders. Sintering involves mass transport to create the
necks and transform them into grain boundaries. The principal mechanism by which this
occurs is diffusion; other possible mechanisms include plastic flow. Shrinkage occurs
during sintering as a result of pore size reduction. This depends to a large extent on the
density of the green compact, which depends on the pressure during compaction.
Shrinkage is generally predictable when processing conditions are closely controlled.
Because PM applications usually involve medium-to-high production, most sintering
furnaces are designed with mechanized flow-through capability for the workparts. The heat
treatment consists of three steps, accomplished in three chambers in these continuous
furnaces: (1) preheat, in which lubricants and binders are burned off; (2) sinter; and (3)
cool down. The treatment is illustrated in Figure 16.13. Typical sintering temperatures and
times are given for selected metals in Table 16.1.
In modern sintering practice, the atmosphere in the furnace is controlled.
The purposes of a controlled atmosphere include (1) protection from oxidation,
(2) providing a reducing atmosphere to remove existing oxides, (3) providing a carburizing atmosphere, and (4) assisting in removing lubricants and binders used in pressing.
Common sintering furnace atmospheres are inert gas, nitrogen-based, dissociated ammonia, hydrogen, and natural gas [6]. Vacuum atmospheres are used for certain metals,
such as stainless steel and tungsten.

16.3.4 SECONDARY OPERATIONS
PM secondary operations include densification, sizing, impregnation, infiltration, heat
treatment, and finishing.

(b) schematic cross
section of a continuous
sintering furnace.

Densification and Sizing A number of secondary operations are performed to increase
density, improve accuracy, or accomplish additional shaping of the sintered part.
Repressing is a pressing operation in which the part is squeezed in a closed die to
increase density and improve physical properties. Sizing is the pressing of a sintered part
to improve dimensional accuracy. Coining is a pressworking operation on a sintered part
to press details into its surface.
Some PM parts require machining after sintering. Machining is rarely done to size
the part, but rather to create geometric features that cannot be achieved by pressing, such
as internal and external threads, side holes, and other details.
Impregnation and Infiltration Porosity is a unique and inherent characteristic of
powder metallurgy technology. It can be exploited to create special products by filling
the available pore space with oils, polymers, or metals that have lower melting temperatures than the base powder metal.
Impregnation is the term used when oil or other fluid is permeated into the pores of a
sintered PM part. The most common products of this process are oil-impregnated bearings,

gears, and similar machinery components. Self-lubricating bearings, usually made of bronze or
iron with 10% to 30% oil by volume, are widely used in the automotive industry. The treatment
is accomplished by immersing the sintered parts in a bath of hot oil.
An alternative application of impregnation involves PM parts that must be made
pressure tight or impervious to fluids. In this case, the parts are impregnated with various
types of polymer resins that seep into the pore spaces in liquid form and then solidify. In
some cases, resin impregnation is used to facilitate subsequent processing, for example, to
permit the use of processing solutions (such as plating chemicals) that would otherwise
soak into the pores and degrade the product, or to improve machinability of the PM
workpart.
Infiltration is an operation in which the pores of the PM part are filled with a molten
metal. The melting point of the filler metal must be below that of the PM part. The process
involves heating the filler metal in contact with the sintered component so that capillary action
draws the filler into the pores. The resulting structure is relatively nonporous, and the
infiltrated part has a more uniform density, as well as improved toughness and strength.
An application of the process is copper infiltration of iron PM parts.

16.3.5 HEAT TREATMENT AND FINISHING
Powder metal components can be heat treated (Chapter 27) and finished (electroplated
or painted, Chapter 28) by most of the same processes used on parts produced by casting
and other metalworking processes. Special care must be exercised in heat treatment
because of porosity; for example, salt baths are not used for heating PM parts. Plating and
coating operations are applied to sintered parts for appearance purposes and corrosion
resistance. Again, precautions must be taken to avoid entrapment of chemical solutions
in the pores; impregnation and infiltration are frequently used for this purpose. Common
platings for PM parts include copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, and cadmium.

16.4 ALTERNATIVE PRESSING AND SINTERING TECHNIQUES
The conventional press and sinter sequence is the most widely used shaping technology in
powder metallurgy. Additional methods for processing PM parts are discussed in this
section.

16.4.1 ISOSTATIC PRESSING
A feature of conventional pressing is that pressure is applied uniaxially. This imposes
limitations on part geometry, because metallic powders do not readily flow in directions
perpendicular to the applied pressure. Uniaxial pressing also leads to density variations in
the compact after pressing. In isostatic pressing, pressure is applied from all directions
against the powders that are contained in a flexible mold; hydraulic pressure is used to
achieve compaction. Isostatic pressing takes two alternative forms: (1) cold isostatic
pressing and (2) hot isostatic pressing.
Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) involves compaction performed at room temperature. The mold, made of rubber or other elastomer material, is oversized to compensate
for shrinkage. Water or oil is used to provide the hydrostatic pressure against the mold
inside the chamber. Figure 16.14 illustrates the processing sequence in cold isostatic
pressing. Advantages of CIP include more uniform density, less expensive tooling, and
greater applicability to shorter production runs. Good dimensional accuracy is difficult to

FIGURE 16.14 Cold isostatic pressing: (1) powders are placed in the flexible mold; (2) hydrostatic pressure is
applied against the mold to compact the powders; and (3) pressure is reduced and the part is removed.

achieve in isostatic pressing because of the flexible mold. Consequently, subsequent
finish shaping operations are often required to obtain the required dimensions, either
before or after sintering.
Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is carried out at high temperatures and pressures, using a
gas such as argon or helium as the compression medium. The mold in which the powders are
contained is made of sheet metal to withstand the high temperatures. HIP accomplishes
pressing and sintering in one step. Despite this apparent advantage, it is a relatively
expensive process and its applications seem to be concentrated in the aerospace industry.
PM parts made by HIP are characterized by high density (porosity near zero), thorough
interparticle bonding, and good mechanical strength.

16.4.2 POWDER INJECTION MOLDING
Injection molding is closely associated with the plastics industry (Section 13.6). The same
basic process can be applied to form parts of metal or ceramic powders, the difference being
that the starting polymer contains a high content of particulate matter, typically from 50%
to 85% by volume. When used in powder metallurgy, the term metal injection molding
(MIM) is used. The more general process is powder injection molding (PIM), which
includes both metal and ceramic powders. The steps in MIM proceed as follows [7]: (1)
Metallic powders are mixed with an appropriate binder. (2) Granular pellets are formed
from the mixture. (3) The pellets are heated to molding temperature, injected into a mold
cavity, and the part is cooled and removed from the mold. (4) The part is processed to
remove the binder using any of several thermal or solvent techniques. (5) The part is
sintered. (6) Secondary operations are performed as appropriate.
The binder in powder injection molding acts as a carrier for the particles. Its
functions are to provide proper flow characteristics during molding and hold the powders
in the molded shape until sintering. The five basic types of binders in PIM are: (1)
thermosetting polymers, such as phenolics; (2) thermoplastic polymers, such as polyethylene; (3) water; (4) gels; and (5) inorganic materials [7]. Polymers are the most
frequently used.
Powder injection molding is suited to part geometries similar to those in plastic
injection molding. It is not cost competitive for simple axisymmetric parts, because the

conventional press-and-sinter process is quite adequate for these cases. PIM seems most
economical for small, complex parts of high value. Dimensional accuracy is limited by the
shrinkage that accompanies densification during sintering.

16.4.3 POWDER ROLLING, EXTRUSION, AND FORGING
Rolling, extrusion, and forging are familiar bulk metal forming processes (Chapter 19).
We describe them here in the context of powder metallurgy.
Powder Rolling Powders can be compressed in a rolling mill operation to form metal
strip stock. The process is usually set up to run continuously or semicontinuously, as shown in
Figure 16.15. The metallic powders are compacted between rolls into a green strip that is fed
directly into a sintering furnace. It is then cold rolled and resintered.
Powder Extrusion Extrusion is one of the basic manufacturing processes (Section
1.3.1). In PM extrusion, the starting powders can be in different forms. In the most
popular method, powders are placed in a vacuum-tight sheet metal can, heated, and
extruded with the container. In another variation, billets are preformed by a conventional
press and sinter process, and then the billet is hot extruded. These methods achieve a high
degree of densification in the PM product.
Powder Forging Forging is an important metal forming process (Section 1.3.1). In
powder forging, the starting workpart is a powder metallurgy part preformed to proper size
by pressing and sintering. Advantages of this approach are: (1) densification of the PM
part, (2) lower tooling costs and fewer forging ‘‘hits’’ (and therefore higher production
rate) because the starting workpart is preformed, and (3) reduced material waste.

16.4.4 COMBINED PRESSING AND SINTERING
Hot isostatic pressing (Section 16.4.1) accomplishes compaction and sintering in one step.
Other techniques that combine the two steps are hot pressing and spark sintering.
Hot Pressing The setup in uniaxial hot pressing is very similar to conventional PM
pressing, except that heat is applied during compaction. The resulting product is generally

E1C16

11/10/2009

16:37:10

Page 361

Section 16.5/Materials and Products for Powder Metallurgy

361

dense, strong, hard, and dimensionally accurate. Despite these advantages, the process
presents certain technical problems that limit its adoption. Principal among these are (1)
selecting a suitable mold material that can withstand the high sintering temperatures; (2)
longer production cycle required to accomplish sintering; and (3) heating and maintaining atmospheric control in the process [2]. Hot pressing has found some application in the
production of sintered carbide products using graphite molds.
Spark Sintering An alternative approach that combines pressing and sintering but
overcomes some of the problems in hot pressing is spark sintering. The process consists of
two basic steps [2], [17]: (1) powder or a green compacted preform is placed in a die; and
(2) upper and lower punches, which also serve as electrodes, compress the part and
simultaneously apply a high-energy electrical current that burns off surface contaminants
and sinters the powders, forming a dense, solid part in about 15 seconds. The process has
been applied to a variety of metals.

16.4.5 LIQUID PHASE SINTERING
Conventional sintering (Section 16.3.3) is solid-state sintering; the metal is sintered at a
temperature below its melting point. In systems involving a mixture of two powder metals,
in which there is a difference in melting temperature between the metals, an alternative
type of sintering is used, called liquid phase sintering. In this process, the two powders are
initially mixed, and then heated to a temperature that is high enough to melt the lowermelting-point metal but not the other. The melted metal thoroughly wets the solid particles,
creating a dense structure with strong bonding between the metals upon solidification.
Depending on the metals involved, prolonged heating may result in alloying of the metals
by gradually dissolving the solid particles into the liquid melt and/or diffusion of the liquid
metal into the solid. In either case, the resulting product is fully densified (no pores) and
strong. Examples of systems that involve liquid phase sintering include Fe–Cu, W–Cu, and
Cu–Co [6].

16.5

MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS FOR POWDER METALLURGY
The raw materials for PM processing are more expensive than for other metalworking
because of the additional energy required to reduce the metal to powder form. Accordingly,
PM is competitive only in a certain range of applications. In this section we identify the
materials and products that seem most suited to powder metallurgy.
Powder Metallurgy Materials From a chemistry standpoint, metal powders can be
classified as either elemental or pre-alloyed. Elemental powders consist of a pure metal
and are used in applications in which high purity is important. For example, pure iron
might be used where its magnetic properties are important. The most common elemental
powders are those of iron, aluminum, and copper.
Elemental powders are also mixed with other metal powders to produce special
alloys that are difficult to formulate using conventional processing methods. Tool steels
are an example; PM permits blending of ingredients that is difficult or impossible by
traditional alloying techniques. Using mixtures of elemental powders to form an alloy
provides a processing benefit, even where special alloys are not involved. Because the
powders are pure metals, they are not as strong as pre-alloyed metals. Therefore, they
deform more readily during pressing, so that density and green strength are higher than
with pre-alloyed compacts.

E1C16

11/10/2009

362

16:37:11

Page 362

Chapter 16/Powder Metallurgy

In pre-alloyed powders, each particle is an alloy composed of the desired chemical
composition. Pre-alloyed powders are used for alloys that cannot be formulated by mixing
elemental powders; stainless steel is an important example. The most common pre-alloyed
powders are certain copper alloys, stainless steel, and high-speed steel.
The commonly used elemental and pre-alloyed powdered metals, in approximate
order of tonnage usage, are: (1) iron, by far the most widely used PM metal, frequently
mixed with graphite to make steel parts, (2) aluminum, (3) copper and its alloys, (4)
nickel, (5) stainless steel, (6) high-speed steel, and (7) other PM materials such as
tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, tin, and precious metals.
Powder Metallurgy Products A substantial advantage offered by PM technology is that
parts can be made to near net shape or net shape; they require little or no additional shaping
after PM processing. Some of the components commonly manufactured by powder
metallurgy are gears, bearings, sprockets, fasteners, electrical contacts, cutting tools, and
various machinery parts. When produced in large quantities, metal gears and bearings are
particularly well suited to PM for two reasons: (1) the geometry is defined principally in two
dimensions, so the part has a top surface of a certain shape, but there are no features along
the sides; and (2) there is a need for porosity in the material to serve as a reservoir for
lubricant. More complex parts with true three-dimensional geometries are also feasible in
powder metallurgy, by adding secondary operations such as machining to complete the
shape of the pressed and sintered part, and by observing certain design guidelines such as
those outlined in the following section.

16.6 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN POWDER METALLURGY
Use of PM techniques is generally suited to a certain class of production situations and
part designs. In this section we attempt to define the characteristics of this class of
applications for which powder metallurgy is most appropriate. We first present a
classification system for PM parts, and then offer some guidelines on component design.
The Metal Powder Industries Federation (MPIF) defines four classes of powder
metallurgy part designs, by level of difficulty in conventional pressing. The system is useful
because it indicates some of the limitations on shape that can be achieved with conventional
PM processing. The four part classes are illustrated in Figure 16.16.

FIGURE 16.16 Four classes of PM parts—side view shown; cross section is circular:
(a) Class I—simple thin shapes that can be pressed from one direction; (b) Class II—simple
but thicker shapes that require pressing from two directions; (c) Class III—two levels of
thickness, pressed from two directions; and (d) Class IV—multiple levels of thickness,
pressed from two directions, with separate controls for each level to achieve proper
densification throughout the compact.

Section 16.6/Design Considerations in Powder Metallurgy

363

The MPIF classification system provides some guidance concerning part geometries that are suited to conventional PM pressing techniques. Additional advice is offered
in the following design guidelines, compiled from [3], [13], and [17].
å Economics of PM processing usually require large part quantities to justify the cost of
equipment and special tooling required. Minimum quantities of 10,000 units are
suggested [17], although exceptions exist.
å Powder metallurgy is unique in its capability to fabricate parts with a controlled level
of porosity. Porosities up to 50% are possible.
å PM can be used to make parts out of unusual metals and alloys—materials that would
be difficult if not impossible to fabricate by other means.
å The geometry of the part must permit ejection from the die after pressing; this
generally means that the part must have vertical or near-vertical sides, although steps
in the part are permissible as suggested by the MPIF classification system (Figure
16.16). Design features such as undercuts and holes on the part sides, as shown in
Figure 16.17, must be avoided. Vertical undercuts and holes, as in Figure 16.18, are
permissible because they do not interfere with ejection. Vertical holes can be of crosssectional shapes other than round (e.g., squares, keyways) without significant
increases in tooling or processing difficulty.
å Screw threads cannot be fabricated by PM pressing; if required, they must be
machined into the PM component after sintering.
å Chamfers and corner radii are possible by PM pressing, as shown in Figure 16.19.
Problems are encountered in punch rigidity when angles are too acute.

Ceramic materials divide into three categories (Chapter 7):
(1) traditional ceramics, (2) new ceramics, and (3) glasses.
The processing of glass involves solidification primarily and
is covered in Chapter 12. In the present chapter we consider
the particulate processing methods used for traditional and
new ceramics. We also consider the processing of metal
matrix composites and ceramic matrix composites.
Traditional ceramics are made from minerals occurring
in nature. They include pottery, porcelain, bricks, and cement.
New ceramics are made from synthetically produced raw
materials and cover a wide spectrum of products such as
cutting tools, artificial bones, nuclear fuels, and substrates for
electronic circuits. The starting material for all of these items
is powder. In the case of the traditional ceramics, the powders
are usually mixed with water to temporarily bind the particles
together and achieve the proper consistency for shaping. For
new ceramics, other substances are used as binders during
shaping. After shaping, the green parts are sintered. This is
often called firing in ceramics, but the function is the same as
in powder metallurgy: to effect a solid-state reaction that
bonds the material into a hard solid mass.
The processing methods discussed in this chapter are
commercially and technologically important because virtually all ceramic products are formed by these methods
(except, of course, glass products). The manufacturing
sequence is similar for traditional and new ceramics because the form of the starting material is the same: powder.
However, the processing methods for the two categories
are sufficiently different that we discuss them separately.

TRADITIONAL CERAMICS

refractories. Bonded grinding wheels are also produced by the same basic methods. What
these products have in common is that their raw materials consist primarily of silicate
ceramics—clays. The processing sequence for most of the traditional ceramics consists of
the steps depicted in Figure 17.1.

17.1.1 PREPARATION OF THE RAW MATERIAL
The shaping processes for traditional ceramics require that the starting material be in the
form of a plastic paste. This paste is made of fine ceramic powders mixed with water, and its
consistency determines the ease of forming the material and the quality of the final product.
The raw ceramic material usually occurs in nature as rocky lumps, and reduction to powder
is the purpose of the preparation step in ceramics processing.
Techniques for reducing particle size in ceramics processing involve mechanical
energy in various forms, such as impact, compression, and attrition. The term comminution
is used for these techniques, which are most effective on brittle materials, including cement,
metallic ores, and brittle metals. Two general categories of comminution operations are
distinguished: crushing and grinding.
Crushing refers to the reduction of large lumps from the mine to smaller sizes for
subsequent further reduction. Several stages may be required (e.g., primary crushing,
secondary crushing), the reduction ratio in each stage being in the range 3 to 6. Crushing of
minerals is accomplished by compression against rigid surfaces or by impact against
surfaces in a rigid constrained motion [1]. Figure 17.2 shows several types of equipment
used to perform crushing: (a) jaw crushers, in which a large jaw toggles back and forth to
crush lumps against a hard, rigid surface; (b) gyratory crushers, which use a gyrating cone
to compress lumps against a rigid surface; (c) roll crushers, in which the ceramic lumps are
squeezed between rotating rolls; and (d) hammer mills, which use rotating hammers
impacting the material to break up the lumps.
Grinding, in the context here, refers to the operation of reducing the small pieces
produced by crushing into a fine powder. Grinding is accomplished by abrasion and impact
of the crushed mineral by the free motion of unconnected hard media such as balls, pebbles,

or rods [1]. Examples of grinding include (a) ball mill, (b) roller mill, and (c) impact
grinding, illustrated in Figure 17.3.
In a ball mill, hard spheres mixed with the stock to be comminuted are tumbled
inside a rotating cylindrical container. The rotation causes the balls and stock to be carried
up the container wall, and then pulled back down by gravity to accomplish a grinding action
by a combination of impact and attrition. These operations are often carried out with water
added to the mixture, so that the ceramic is in the form of a slurry. In a roller mill, stock is
compressed against a flat horizontal grinding table by rollers riding over the table surface.
Although not clearly shown in the sketch, the pressure of the grinding rollers against the
table is regulated by mechanical springs or hydraulic-pneumatic means. In impact grinding,
which seems to be less frequently used, particles of stock are thrown against a hard flat
surface, either in a high velocity air stream or a high-speed slurry. The impact fractures the
pieces into smaller particles.
The plastic paste required for shaping consists of ceramic powders and water. Clay is
usually the main ingredient in the paste because it has ideal forming characteristics. The more

water there is in the mixture, the more plastic and easily formed is the clay paste. However,
when the formed part is later dried and fired, shrinkage occurs that can lead to cracking in the
product.To addressthisproblem,otherceramicrawmaterialsthatdo notshrink on dryingand
firing are usually added to the paste, often in significant amounts. Also, other components can
be included to serve special functions. Thus, the ingredients of the ceramic paste can be
divided into the following three categories [3]: (1) clay, which provides the consistency and
plasticity required for shaping; (2) nonplastic raw materials, such as alumina and silica,
which do not shrink in drying and firing but unfortunately reduce plasticity in the mixture
during forming; and (3) other ingredients, such as fluxes that melt (vitrify) during firing and
promote sintering of the ceramic material, and wetting agents that improve mixing of
ingredients.
These ingredients must be thoroughly mixed, either wet or dry. The ball mill often
serves this purpose in addition to its grinding function. Also, the proper amounts of powder
and water in the paste must be attained, so water must be added or removed, depending on
the prior condition of the paste and its desired final consistency.

17.1.2 SHAPING PROCESSES
The optimum proportions of powder and water depend on the shaping process used.
Some shaping processes require high fluidity; others act on a composition that contains
very low water content. At about 50% water by volume, the mixture is a slurry that flows
like a liquid. As the water content is reduced, increased pressure is required on the paste
to produce a similar flow. Thus, the shaping processes can be divided according to the
consistency of the mixture: (1) slip casting, in which the mixture is a slurry with 25% to
40% water; (2) plastic-forming methods that shape the clay in a plastic condition at 15%
to 25% water; (3) semi-dry pressing, in which the clay is moist (10% to 15% water) but
has low plasticity; and (4) dry pressing, in which the clay is basically dry, containing less
than 5% water. Dry clay has no plasticity. The four categories are represented in the
chart of Figure 17.4, which compares the categories with the condition of the clay used as
starting material. Each category includes several different shaping processes.
Slip Casting In slip casting, a suspension of ceramic powders in water, called a slip, is
poured into a porous plaster of paris (CaSO4–2H2O) mold so that water from the mix is

gradually absorbed into the plaster to form a firm layer of clay at the mold surface. The
composition of the slip is typically 25% to 40% water, the remainder being clay often
mixed with other ingredients. It must be sufficiently fluid to flow into the crevices of the
mold cavity, yet lower water content is desirable for faster production rates. Slip casting
has two principal variations: drain casting and solid casting. In drain casting, which is the
traditional process, the mold is inverted to drain excess slip after the semi-solid layer has
been formed, thus leaving a hollow part in the mold; the mold is then opened and the part
removed. The sequence, which is very similar to slush casting of metals, is illustrated in
Figure 17.5. It is used to make tea pots, vases, art objects, and other hollow-ware products.
In solid casting, used to produce solid products, adequate time is allowed for the entire
body to become firm. The mold must be periodically resupplied with additional slip to
account for shrinkage because of absorbed water.
Plastic Forming Thiscategoryincludesavariety ofmethods,both manual and mechanized.
They all require the starting mixture to have a plastic consistency, which is generally achieved
with 15% to 25% water. Manual methods generally make use of clay at the upper end of the
range because it provides a material that is more easily formed; however, this is accompanied
by greater shrinkage in drying. Mechanized methods generally employ a mixture with lower
water content so that the starting clay is stiffer.
Although manual forming methods date back thousands of years, they are still
used today by skilled artisans, either in production or for artworks. Hand modeling
involves the creation of the ceramic product by manipulating the mass of plastic clay

into the desired geometry. In addition to art pieces, patterns for plaster molds in slip
casting are often made this way. Hand molding is a similar method, only a mold or form
is used to define portions of the geometry. Hand throwing on a potter’s wheel is another
refinement of the handicraft methods. The potter’s wheel is a round table that rotates on
a vertical spindle, powered either by motor or foot-operated treadle. Ceramic products
of circular cross section can be formed on the rotating table by throwing and shaping the
clay, sometimes using a mold to provide the internal shape.
Strictly speaking, use of a motor-driven potter’s wheel is a mechanized method.
However, most mechanized clay-forming methods are characterized by much less
manual participation than the hand-throwing method described above. These more
mechanized methods include jiggering, plastic pressing, and extrusion. Jiggering is an
extension of the potter’s wheel methods, in which hand throwing is replaced by mechanized techniques. It is used to produce large numbers of identical items such as houseware
plates and bowls. Although there are variations in the tools and methods used, reflecting
different levels of automation and refinements to the basic process, a typical sequence is
as follows, depicted in Figure 17.6: (1) a wet clay slug is placed on a convex mold; (2) a
forming tool is pressed into the slug to provide the initial rough shape—the operation is
called batting and the workpiece thus created is called a bat; and (3) a heated jigger tool
is used to impart the final contoured shape to the product by pressing the profile into the
surface during rotation of the workpart. The reason for heating the tool is to produce
steam from the wet clay that prevents sticking. Closely related to jiggering is jolleying, in
which the basic mold shape is concave rather than convex [8]. In both of these processes, a
rolling tool is sometimes used in place of the nonrotating jigger (or jolley) tool; this rolls
the clay into shape, avoiding the need to first bat the slug.
Plastic pressing is a forming process in which a plastic clay slug is pressed between
upper and lower molds, contained in metal rings. The molds are made of a porous material
such as gypsum, so that when a vacuum is drawn on the backs of the mold halves, moisture is
removed from the clay. The mold sections are then opened, using positive air pressure to
prevent sticking of the part in the mold. Plastic pressing achieves a higher production rate
than jiggering and is not limited to radially symmetric parts.
Extrusion is used in ceramics processing to produce long sections of uniform cross
section, which are then cut to required piece length. The extrusion equipment utilizes a
screw-type action to assist in mixing the clay and pushing the plastic material through the
die opening. This production sequence is widely used to make hollow bricks, shaped tiles,
drain pipes, tubes, and insulators. It is also used to make the starting clay slugs for other
ceramics processing methods such as jiggering and plastic pressing.
Semi-dry Pressing In semi-dry pressing, the proportion of water in the starting clay is
typically 10% to 15%. This results in low plasticity, precluding the use of plastic forming
methods that require very plastic clay. Semi-dry pressing uses high pressure to overcome

the material’s low plasticity and force it to flow into a die cavity, as depicted in Figure 17.7.
Flash is often formed from excess clay being squeezed between the die sections.
Dry Pressing The main distinction between semi-dry and dry pressing is the moisture
content of the starting mix. The moisture content of the starting clay in dry pressing is
typically below 5%. Binders are usually added to the dry powder mix to provide sufficient
strength in the pressed part for subsequent handling. Lubricants are also added to prevent
die sticking during pressing and ejection. Because dry clay has no plasticity and is very
abrasive, there are differences in die design and operating procedures, compared with semidry pressing. The dies must be made of hardened tool steel or cemented tungsten carbide to
reduce wear. Because dry clay will not flow during pressing, the geometry of the part must
be relatively simple, and the amount and distribution of starting powder in the die cavity
must be right. No flash is formed in dry pressing, and no drying shrinkage occurs, so drying
time is eliminated and good accuracy can be achieved in the dimensions of the final product.
The process sequence in dry pressing is similar to semi-dry pressing. Typical products
include bathroom tile, electrical insulators, and refractory brick.

17.1.3 DRYING
Water plays an important role in most of the traditional ceramics shaping processes.
Thereafter, it serves no purpose and must be removed from the body of the clay piece
before firing. Shrinkage is a problem during this step in the processing sequence because
water contributes volume to the piece, and when it is removed, the volume is reduced. The
effect can be seen in Figure 17.8. As water is initially added to dry clay, it simply replaces the
air in the pores between ceramic grains, and there is no volumetric change. Increasing the
water content above a certain point causes the grains to become separated and the volume
to grow, resulting in wet clay that has plasticity and formability. As more water is added, the
mixture eventually becomes a liquid suspension of clay particles in water.
The reverse of this process occurs in drying. As water is removed from the wet clay,
the volume of the piece shrinks. The drying process occurs in two stages, as depicted in
Figure 17.9. In the first stage, the rate of drying is rapid and constant, as water is evaporated

different clay compositions.

from the surface of the clay into the surrounding air and water from the interior migrates by
capillary action toward the surface to replace it. It is during this stage that shrinkage occurs,
with the associated risk of warping and cracking owing to variations in drying in different
sections of the piece. In the second stage of drying, the moisture content has been reduced
to where the ceramic grains are in contact, and little or no further shrinkage occurs. The
drying process slows, and this is seen in the decreasing rate in the plot.
In production, drying is usually accomplished in drying chambers in which temperature and humidity are controlled to achieve the proper drying schedule. Care must be taken
so that water is not removed too rapidly, lest large moisture gradients be set up in the piece,
making it more prone to crack. Heating is usually by a combination of convection and
radiation, using infrared sources. Typical drying times range between a quarter of an hour
for thin sections to several days for very thick sections.

17.1.4 FIRING (SINTERING)
After shaping but before firing, the ceramic piece is said to be green (the same term as in
powder metallurgy), meaning not fully processed or treated. The green piece lacks
hardness and strength; it must be fired to fix the part shape and achieve hardness and
strength in the finished ware. Firing is the heat treatment process that sinters the ceramic
material; it is performed in a furnace called a kiln. In sintering, bonds are developed
between the ceramic grains, and this is accompanied by densification and reduction of
porosity. Therefore, shrinkage occurs in the polycrystalline material in addition to the
shrinkage that has already occurred in drying. Sintering in ceramics is basically the same

stage of drying is depicted here as a
straight line (constant rate decrease as
a function of water content); the
function is variously shown as concave
or convex in the literature [3], [8].

mechanism as in powder metallurgy. In the firing of traditional ceramics, certain chemical
reactions between the components in the mixture may also take place, and a glassy phase
also forms among the crystals that acts as a binder. Both of these phenomena depend on
the chemical composition of the ceramic material and the firing temperatures used.
Unglazed ceramic ware is fired only once; glazed products are fired twice. Glazing
refers to the application of a ceramic surface coating to make the piece more impervious to
water and to enhance its appearance (Section 7.2.2). The usual processing sequence with
glazed ware is (1) fire the ware once before glazing to harden the body of the piece, (2) apply
the glaze, and (3) fire the piece a second time to harden the glaze.

17.2 PROCESSING OF NEW CERAMICS
Most of the traditional ceramics are based on clay, which possesses a unique capacity to be
plastic when mixed with water but hard when dried and fired. Clay consists of various
formulations of hydrous aluminum silicate, usually mixed with other ceramic materials, to
form a rather complex chemistry. New ceramics (Section 7.3) are based on simpler chemical
compounds, such as oxides, carbides, and nitrides. These materials do not possess the plasticity
and formabilityoftraditionalclaywhenmixed withwater.Accordingly,otheringredientsmust
be combined with the ceramic powders to achieve plasticity and other desirable properties
during forming, so that conventional shaping methods can be used. The new ceramics are
generallydesignedforapplicationsthatrequirehigherstrength,hardness,andotherproperties
not found in the traditional ceramic materials. These requirements have motivated the
introduction of several new processingtechniques not previouslyused for traditional ceramics.
The manufacturing sequence for the new ceramics can be summarized in the
following steps: (1) preparation of starting materials, (2) shaping, (3) sintering, and
(4) finishing. Although the sequence is nearly the same as for the traditional ceramics,
the details are often quite different, as we shall see in the following.

17.2.1 PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALS
Because the strength specified for these materials is usually much greater than for traditional
ceramics, the starting powders must be more homogeneous in size and composition, and
particle size must be smaller (strength of the resulting ceramic product is inversely related to
grain size). All of this means that greater control of the starting powders is required. Powder
preparation includes mechanical and chemical methods. The mechanical methods consist of
the same ball mill grinding operations used for traditional ceramics. The trouble with these
methods is that the ceramic particles become contaminated from the materials used in the
balls and walls of the mill. This compromises the purity of the ceramic powders and results in
microscopic flaws that reduce the strength of the final product.
Two chemical methods are used to achieve greater homogeneity in the powders of new
ceramics: freeze drying and precipitation from solution. In freeze drying, salts of the
appropriate starting chemistry are dissolved in water and the solution is sprayed to form
small droplets, which are rapidly frozen. The water is then removed from the droplets in a
vacuum chamber, and the resulting freeze-dried salt is decomposed by heating to form the
ceramic powders. Freeze drying is not applicable to all ceramics, because in some cases a
suitable water-soluble salt cannot be identified as the starting material.
Precipitation from solution is another preparation method used for new ceramics.
In the typical process, the desired ceramic compound is dissolved from the starting
mineral, thus permitting impurities to be filtered out. An intermediate compound is then
precipitated from solution, which is converted into the desired compound by heating. An

E1C17

example of the precipitation method is the Bayer process for producing high purity
alumina (also used in the production of aluminum). In this process, aluminum oxide is
dissolved from the mineral bauxite so that iron compounds and other impurities can be
removed. Then, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) is precipitated from solution and
reduced to Al2O3 by heating.
Further preparation of the powders includes classification by size and mixing before
shaping. Very fine powders are required for new ceramics applications, and so the grains must
be separated and classified according to size. Thorough mixing of the particles, especially
when different ceramic powders are combined, is required to avoid segregation.
Various additives are often combined with the starting powders, usually in small
amounts. The additives include (1) plasticizers to improve plasticity and workability;
(2) binders to bond the ceramic particles into a solid mass in the final product, (3) wetting
agents for better mixing; (4) deflocculants, which help to prevent clumping and premature
bonding of the powders; and (5) lubricants, to reduce friction between ceramic grains
during forming and to reduce sticking during mold release.

17.2.2 SHAPING
Many of the shaping processes for new ceramics are borrowed from powder metallurgy
(PM) and traditional ceramics. The press and sinter methods discussed in Section 16.3 have
been adapted to the new ceramic materials. And some of the traditional ceramics-forming
techniques (Section 17.1.2) are used to shape the new ceramics, including slip casting,
extrusion, and dry pressing. The following processes are not normally associated with the
forming of traditional ceramics, although several are associated with PM.
Hot Pressing Hot pressing is similar to dry pressing (Section 17.1.2), except that the
process is carried out at elevated temperatures, so that sintering of the product is
accomplished simultaneously with pressing. This eliminates the need for a separate firing
step in the sequence. Higher densities and finer grain size are obtained, but die life is
reduced by the hot abrasive particles against the die surfaces.
Isostatic Pressing Isostatic pressing of ceramics is the same process used in powder
metallurgy (Section 16.4.1). It uses hydrostatic pressure to compact the ceramic powders
from all directions, thus avoiding the problem of nonuniform density in the final product
that is often observed in the traditional uniaxial pressing method.
Doctor-Blade Process This process is used for making thin sheets of ceramic. One
common application of the sheets is in the electronics industry as a substrate material for
integrated circuits. The process is diagrammed in Figure 17.10. A ceramic slurry is introduced
onto a moving carrier film such as cellophane. Thickness of the ceramic on the carrier is
determined by a wiper, called a doctor-blade. As the slurry moves down the line, it is dried

into a flexible green ceramic tape. At the end of the line, a take-up spool reels in the tape for
later processing. In its green condition, the tape can be cut or otherwise shaped before firing.
Powder Injection Molding Powder injection molding (PIM) is the same as the PM
process (Section 16.4.2), except that the powders are ceramic rather than metallic. Ceramic
particles are mixed with a thermoplastic polymer that acts as a carrier and provides the
proper flow characteristics at molding temperatures. The mix is then heated and injected into
a mold cavity. Upon cooling, which hardens the polymer, the mold is opened and the part is
removed. Because the temperatures needed to plasticize the carrier are much lower than
those required for sintering the ceramic, the piece is green after molding. Before sintering,
the plastic binder must be removed. This is called debinding, which is usually accomplished
by a combination of thermal and solvent treatments.
Applications of ceramic PIM are currently inhibited by difficulties in debinding and
sintering. Burning off the polymer is relatively slow, and its removal significantly weakens
the green strength of the molded part. Warping and cracking often occur during sintering.
Further, ceramic products made by powder injection molding are especially vulnerable to
microstructural flaws that limit their strength.

17.2.3 SINTERING
Because the plasticity needed to shape the new ceramics is not normally based on a water
mixture, the drying step so commonly required to remove water from the traditional
green ceramics can be omitted in the processing of most new ceramic products. The
sintering step, however, is still very much required to obtain maximum possible strength
and hardness. The functions of sintering are the same as before, to: (1) bond individual
grains into a solid mass, (2) increase density, and (3) reduce or eliminate porosity.
Temperatures around 80% to 90% of the melting temperature of the material are
commonly used in sintering ceramics. Sintering mechanisms differ somewhat between the
new ceramics, which are based predominantly on a single chemical compound (e.g., Al2O3),
and the clay-based ceramics, which usually consist of several compounds having different
melting points. In the case of the new ceramics, the sintering mechanism is mass diffusion
across the contacting particle surfaces, probably accompanied by some plastic flow. This
mechanism causes the centers of the particles to move closer together, resulting in
densification of the final material. In the sintering of traditional ceramics, this mechanism
is complicated by the melting of some constituents and the formation of a glassy phase that
acts as a binder between the grains.

17.2.4 FINISHING
Parts made of new ceramics sometimes require finishing. In general, these operations have
one or more of the following purposes, to: (1) increase dimensional accuracy, (2) improve
surface finish, and (3) make minor changes in part geometry. Finishing operations usually
involve grinding and other abrasive processes (Chapter 25). Diamond abrasives must be
used to cut the hardened ceramic materials.

17.3 PROCESSING OF CERMETS
Many metal matrix composites (MMCs) and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are
processed by particulate processing methods. The most prominent examples are
cemented carbides and other cermets.

17.3.1 CEMENTED CARBIDES
The cemented carbides are a family of composite materials consisting of carbide ceramic
particles embedded in a metallic binder. They are classified as metal matrix composites
because the metallic binder is the matrix that holds the bulk material together; however, the
carbide particles constitute the largest proportion of the composite material, normally
ranging between 80% and 96% by volume. Cemented carbides are technically classified as
cermets, although they are often distinguished from the other materials in this class.
The most important cemented carbide is tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder (WC–
Co). Generally included within this category are certain mixtures of WC, TiC, and TaC in a
Co matrix, in which tungsten carbide is the major component. Other cemented carbides
include titanium carbide in nickel (TiC–Ni) and chromium carbide in nickel (Cr3C2–Ni).
These composites are discussed in Section 9.2.1, and the carbide ingredients are described
in Section 7.3.2. In our present discussion we are concerned with the particulate processing
of cemented carbide.
To provide a strong and pore-free part, the carbide powders must be sintered with a
metal binder. Cobalt works best with WC, whereas nickel is better with TiC and Cr3C2. The
usual proportion of binder metal is from around 4% up to 20%. Powders of carbide and
binder metal are thoroughly mixed wet in a ball mill (or other suitable mixing machine) to
form a homogeneous sludge. Milling also serves to refine particle size. The sludge is then dried
in a vacuum or controlled atmosphere to prevent oxidation in preparation for compaction.
Compaction Various methods are used to shape the powder mix into a green compact of
the desired geometry. The most common process is cold pressing, described earlier and used
for high production of cemented carbide parts such as cutting tool inserts. The dies used in
cold pressing must be made oversized to account for shrinkage during sintering. Linear
shrinkage can be 20% or more. For high production, the dies themselves are made with
WC–Co liners to reduce wear, because of the abrasive nature of carbide particles. For
smaller quantities, large flat sections are sometimes pressed and then cut into smaller pieces
of the specified size.
Other compaction methods used for cemented carbide products include isostatic
pressing and hot pressing for large pieces, such as draw dies and ball mill balls; and
extrusion, for long sections of circular, rectangular, or other cross section. Each of these
processes has been described previously, either in this or the preceding chapter.
Sintering Although it is possible to sinter WC and TiC without a binder metal, the
resulting material is somewhat less than 100% of true density. Use of a binder yields a
structure that is virtually free of porosity.
Sintering of WC–Co involves liquid phase sintering (Section 16.4.5). The process can
be explained with reference to the binary phase diagram for these constituents in
Figure 17.11. The typical composition range for commercial cemented carbide products
is identified in the diagram. The usual sintering temperatures for WC–Co are in the range
1370 C to 1425 C (2500 C to 2600 F), which is below cobalt’s melting point of 1495 C
(2716 F). Thus, the pure binder metal does not melt at the sintering temperature. However,
as the phase diagram shows, WC dissolves in Co in the solid state. During the heat
treatment, WC is gradually dissolved into the gamma phase, and its melting point is reduced
so that melting finally occurs. As the liquid phase forms, it flows and wets the WC particles,
further dissolving the solid. The presence of the molten metal also serves to remove gases
from the internal regions of the compact. These mechanisms combine to effect a
rearrangement of the remaining WC particles into a closer packing, which results in
significant densification and shrinkage of the WC–Co mass. Later, during cooling in the
sintering cycle, the dissolved carbide is precipitated and deposited onto the existing crystals
to form a coherent WC skeleton, throughout which the Co binder is embedded.

Secondary Operations Subsequent processing is usually required after sintering to
achieve adequate dimensional control of cemented carbide parts. Grinding with a
diamond abrasive wheel is the most common secondary operation performed for this
purpose. Other processes used to shape the hard cemented carbides include electric
discharge machining and ultrasonic machining, two nontraditional material removal
processes discussed in Chapter 26.

17.3.2 OTHER CERMETS AND CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES
In addition to cemented carbides, other cermets are based on oxide ceramics such as
Al2O3 and MgO. Chromium is a common metal binder used in these composite materials.
The ceramic-to-metal proportions cover a wider range than those of the cemented
carbides; in some cases, the metal is the major ingredient. These cermets are formed into
useful products by the same basic shaping methods used for cemented carbides.
The current technology of ceramic matrix composites (Section 9.3) includes ceramic
materials (e.g., Al2O3, BN, Si3N4, and glass) reinforced by fibers of carbon, SiC, or Al2O3. If
the fibers are whiskers (fibers consisting of single crystals), these CMCs can be processed by
particulate methods used for new ceramics (Section 17.2).

17.4 PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Ceramic materials have special properties that make them attractive to designers if the
application is right. The following design recommendations, compiled from Bralla [2] and
other sources, apply to both new and traditional ceramic materials, although designers
are more likely to find opportunities for new ceramics in engineered products. In general,
the same guidelines apply to cemented carbides.
å Ceramic materials are several times stronger in compression than in tension;
accordingly, ceramic components should be designed to be subjected to compressive
stresses, not tensile stresses.
å Ceramics are brittle and possess almost no ductility. Ceramic parts should not be used
in applications that involve impact loading or high stresses that might cause fracture.

Review Questions

381

å Although many of the ceramic shaping processes allow complex geometries to be
formed, it is desirable to keep shapes simple for both economic and technical reasons.
Deep holes, channels, and undercuts should be avoided, as should large cantilevered
projections.
å Outside edges and corners should have radii or chamfers; likewise, inside corners
should have radii. This guideline is, of course, violated in cutting tool applications, in
which the cutting edge must be sharp to function. The cutting edge is often fabricated
with a very small radius or chamfer to protect it from microscopic chipping, which
could lead to failure.
å Part shrinkage in drying and firing (for traditional ceramics) and sintering (for new
ceramics) may be significant and must be taken into account by the designer in
dimensioning and tolerancing. This is mostly a problem for manufacturing engineers,
who must determine appropriate size allowances so that the final dimensions will be
within the tolerances specified.
å Screw threads in ceramic parts should be avoided. They are difficult to fabricate and
do not have adequate strength in service after fabrication.

Overview of Metal Forming
Material Behavior in Metal Forming
Temperature in Metal Forming
Strain Rate Sensitivity
Friction and Lubrication in Metal Forming

Metal forming includes a large group of manufacturing processes in which plastic deformation is used to change the shape
of metal workpieces. Deformation results from the use of a tool,
usually called a die in metal forming, which applies stresses that
exceed the yield strength of the metal. The metal therefore
deforms to take a shape determined by the geometry of the die.
Metal forming dominates the class of shaping operations identified in Chapter 1 as the deformation processes (Figure 1.4).
Stresses applied to plastically deform the metal are
usually compressive. However, some forming processes
stretch the metal, while others bend the metal, and still others
apply shear stresses to the metal. To be successfully formed, a
metal must possess certain properties. Desirable properties
include low yield strength and high ductility. These properties
are affected by temperature. Ductility is increased and yield
strength is reduced when work temperature is raised. The
effect of temperature gives rise to distinctions between cold
working, warm working, and hot working. Strain rate and
friction are additional factors that affect performance in metal
forming. We examine all of these issues in this chapter, but first
let us provide an overview of the metal forming processes.

processes. These two categories are covered in detail in Chapters 19 and 20, respectively. Each
category includes several major classes of shaping operations, as indicated in Figure 18.1.
Bulk Deformation Processes Bulk deformation processes are generally characterized
by significant deformations and massive shape changes, and the surface area-to-volume of
the work is relatively small. The term bulk describes the workparts that have this low areato-volume ratio. Starting work shapes for these processes include cylindrical billets and
rectangular bars. Figure 18.2 illustrates the following basic operations in bulk deformation:

å Rolling. This is a compressive deformation process in which the thickness of a slab
or plate is reduced by two opposing cylindrical tools called rolls. The rolls rotate so
as to draw the work into the gap between them and squeeze it.
å Forging. In forging, a workpiece is compressed between two opposing dies, so that the
die shapes are imparted to the work. Forging is traditionally a hot working process, but
many types of forging are performed cold.
å Extrusion. This is a compression process in which the work metal is forced to flow
through a die opening, thereby taking the shape of the opening as its own cross section.
å Drawing. In this forming process, the diameter of a round wire or bar is reduced by
pulling it through a die opening.
Sheet Metalworking Sheet metalworking processes are forming and cutting operations
performed on metal sheets, strips, and coils. The surface area-to-volume ratio of the starting
metal is high; thus, this ratio is a useful means to distinguish bulk deformation from sheet
metal processes. Pressworking is the term often applied to sheet metal operations because
the machines used to perform these operations are presses (presses of various types are also
used in other manufacturing processes). A part produced in a sheet metal operation is often
called a stamping.
Sheet metal operations are always performed as cold working processes and are
usually accomplished using a set of tools called a punch and die. The punch is the positive
portion and the die is the negative portion of the tool set. The basic sheet metal operations
are sketched in Figure 18.3 and are defined as follows:
å Bending. Bending involves straining of a metal sheet or plate to take an angle along a
(usually) straight axis.

Chapter 18/Fundamentals of Metal Forming

å Drawing. In sheet metalworking, drawing refers to the forming of a flat metal sheet
into a hollow or concave shape, such as a cup, by stretching the metal. A blankholder
is used to hold down the blank while the punch pushes into the sheet metal, as shown
in Figure 18.3(b). To distinguish this operation from bar and wire drawing, the terms
cup drawing or deep drawing are often used.
å Shearing. This process seems somewhat out-of-place in a list of deformation processes,
because it involves cutting rather than forming. A shearing operation cuts the work using
a punch and die, as in Figure 18.3(c). Although it is not a forming process, it is included
here because it is a necessary and very common operation in sheet metalworking.
The miscellaneous processes within the sheet metalworking classification in Figure 18.1
include a variety of related shaping processes that do not use punch and die tooling. Examples
of these processes are stretch forming, roll bending, spinning, and bending of tube stock.

18.2 MATERIAL BEHAVIOR IN METAL FORMING
Considerable insight about the behavior of metals during forming can be obtained from the
stress–strain curve. The typical stress–strain curve for most metals is divided into an elastic
region and a plastic region (Section 3.1.1). In metal forming, the plastic region is of primary
interest because the material is plastically and permanently deformed in these processes.
The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the yield
point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior in linear and
logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed by the flow curve:
s ¼ Ken
where K ¼ the strength coefficient, MPa (lb/in2); and n is the strain-hardening exponent.
The stress s and strain e in the flow curve are true stress and true strain. The flow curve is
generally valid as a relationship that defines a metal’s plastic behavior in cold working.
Typical values of K and n for different metals at room temperature are listed in Table 3.4.
Flow Stress The flow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region in which
metal forming takes place. It indicates the flow stress of the metal—the strength property
that determines forces and power required to accomplish a particular forming operation.
For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as
the metal is deformed, its strength increases due to strain hardening. The stress required to
continue deformation must be increased to match this increase in strength. Flow stress is
defined as the instantaneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—
to keep the metal ‘‘flowing.’’ It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which can
be expressed:
Y f ¼ Ken

ð18:1Þ

where Yf ¼ flow stress, MPa (lb/in2).
In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the
instantaneous flow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For example,
in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression can be determined from the flow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated based on the flow stress
that results from the final strain at the end of the forging stroke.
In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur
during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,
Figure 18.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion

location of average flow stress Y f in relation
to yield strength Y and final flow stress Yf.

die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather than
determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduction, which
would be not only difficult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to analyze the
process based on the average flow stress during deformation.
Average Flow Stress The average flow stress (also called the mean flow stress) is the
average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain to the final
(maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated in the stress–
strain plot of Figure 18.4. The average flow stress is determined by integrating the flow
curve equation, Eq. (18.1), between zero and the final strain value defining the range of
interest. This yields the equation:
Yf ¼

Ken
1þn

ð18:2Þ

where Y f ¼ average flow stress, MPa (lb/in2); and e ¼ maximum strain value during the
deformation process.
We make extensive use of the average flow stress in our study of the bulk deformation
processes in the following chapter. Given values of K and n for the work material, a method
of computing final strain will be developed for each process. Based on this strain, Eq. (18.2)
can be used to determine the average flow stress to which the metal is subjected during the
operation.

18.3

TEMPERATURE IN METAL FORMING
The flow curve is a valid representation of stress–strain behavior of a metal during plastic
deformation, particularly for cold working operations. For any metal, the values of K and n
depend on temperature. Strength and strain hardening are both reduced at higher temperatures. These property changes are important because they result in lower forces and power
during forming. In addition, ductility is increased at higher temperatures, which allows
greater plastic deformation of the work metal. We can distinguish three temperature ranges
that are used in metal forming: cold, warm, and hot working.
Cold Working Cold working (also known as cold forming) is metal forming performed
at room temperature or slightly above. Significant advantages of cold forming compared

E1C18

Chapter 18/Fundamentals of Metal Forming

to hot working are (1) greater accuracy, meaning closer tolerances can be achieved; (2)
better surface finish; (3) higher strength and hardness of the part due to strain hardening;
(4) grain flow during deformation provides the opportunity for desirable directional
properties to be obtained in the resulting product; and (5) no heating of the work is
required, which saves on furnace and fuel costs and permits higher production rates.
Owing to this combination of advantages, many cold forming processes have become
important mass-production operations. They provide close tolerances and good surfaces,
minimizing the amount of machining required so that these operations can be classified
as net shape or near net shape processes (Section 1.3.1).
There are certain disadvantages or limitations associated with cold forming
operations: (1) higher forces and power are required to perform the operation;
(2) care must be taken to ensure that the surfaces of the starting workpiece are free
of scale and dirt; and (3) ductility and strain hardening of the work metal limit the amount
of forming that can be done to the part. In some operations, the metal must be annealed
(Section 27.1) in order to allow further deformation to be accomplished. In other cases,
the metal is simply not ductile enough to be cold worked.
To overcome the strain-hardening problem and reduce force and power requirements,
many forming operations are performed at elevated temperatures. There are two elevated
temperature ranges involved, giving rise to the terms warm working and hot working.
Warm Working Because plastic deformation properties are normally enhanced by
increasing workpiece temperature, forming operations are sometimes performed at
temperatures somewhat above room temperature but below the recrystallization temperature. The term warm working is applied to this second temperature range. The dividing
line between cold working and warm working is often expressed in terms of the melting
point for the metal. The dividing line is usually taken to be 0.3 Tm, where Tm is the melting
point (absolute temperature) for the particular metal.
The lower strength and strain hardening at the intermediate temperatures, as well
as higher ductility, provide warm working with the following advantages over cold
working: (1) lower forces and power, (2) more intricate work geometries possible,
and (3) need for annealing may be reduced or eliminated.
Hot Working Hot working (also called hot forming) involves deformation at temperatures above the recrystallization temperature (Section 3.3). The recrystallization temperature for a given metal is about one-half of its melting point on the absolute scale. In practice,
hot working is usually carried out at temperatures somewhat above 0.5Tm. The work metal
continues to soften as temperature is increased beyond 0.5Tm, thus enhancing the advantage
of hot working above this level. However, the deformation process itself generates heat,
which increases work temperatures in localized regions of the part. This can cause melting in
these regions, which is highly undesirable. Also, scale on the work surface is accelerated at
higher temperatures. Accordingly, hot working temperatures are usually maintained within
the range 0.5Tm to 0.75Tm.
The most significant advantage of hot working is the capability to produce substantial
plastic deformation of the metal—far more than is possible with cold working or warm
working. The principal reason for this is that the flow curve of the hot-worked metal has a
strength coefficient that is substantially less than at room temperature, the strain-hardening
exponent is zero (at least theoretically), and the ductility of the metal is significantly
increased. All of this results in the following advantages relative to cold working: (1) the
shape of the workpart can be significantly altered, (2) lower forces and power are required
to deform the metal, (3) metals that usually fracture in cold working can be hot formed, (4)
strength properties are generally isotropic because of the absence of the oriented grain
structure typically created in cold working, and (5) no strengthening of the part occurs
from work hardening. This last advantage may seem inconsistent, since strengthening of

the metal is often considered an advantage for cold working. However, there are
applications in which it is undesirable for the metal to be work hardened because it
reduces ductility, for example, if the part is to be subsequently processed by cold forming.
Disadvantages of hot working include (1) lower dimensional accuracy, (2) higher total
energy required (due to the thermal energy to heat the workpiece), (3) work surface
oxidation (scale), (4) poorer surface finish, and (5) shorter tool life.
Recrystallization of the metal in hot working involves atomic diffusion, which is a
time-dependent process. Metal forming operations are often performed at high speeds that
do not allow sufficient time for complete recrystallization of the grain structure during the
deformation cycle itself. However, because of the high temperatures, recrystallization
eventually does occur. It may occur immediately following the forming process or later, as
the workpiece cools. Even though recrystallization may occur after the actual deformation,
its eventual occurrence, and the substantial softening of the metal at high temperatures, are
the features that distinguish hot working from warm working or cold working.
Isothermal Forming Certain metals, such as highly alloyed steels, many titanium alloys,
and high-temperature nickel alloys, possess good hot hardness, a property that makes them
useful for high-temperature service. However, this very property that makes them attractive in these applications also makes them difficult to form with conventional methods. The
problem is that when these metals are heated to their hot working temperatures and then
come in contact with the relatively cold forming tools, heat is quickly transferred away from
the part surfaces, thus raising the strength in these regions. The variations in temperature
and strength in different regions of the workpiece cause irregular flow patterns in the metal
during deformation, leading to high residual stresses and possible surface cracking.
Isothermal forming refers to forming operations that are carried out in such a way
as to eliminate surface cooling and the resulting thermal gradients in the workpart. It is
accomplished by preheating the tools that come in contact with the part to the same
temperature as the work metal. This weakens the tools and reduces tool life, but it avoids
the problems described above when these difficult metals are formed by conventional
methods. In some cases, isothermal forming represents the only way in which these work
materials can be formed. The procedure is most closely associated with forging, and we
discuss isothermal forging in the following chapter.

18.4

STRAIN RATE SENSITIVITY
Theoretically, a metal in hot working behaves like a perfectly plastic material, with strainhardening exponent n ¼ 0. This means that the metal should continue to flow under the
same level of flow stress, once that stress level is reached. However, there is an additional
phenomenon that characterizes the behavior of metals during deformation, especially at
the elevated temperatures of hot working. That phenomenon is strain rate sensitivity. Let
us begin our discussion of this topic by defining strain rate.
The rate at which the metal is strained in a forming process is directly related to the
speed of deformation, v. In many forming operations, deformation speed is equal to the
velocity of the ram or other moving element of the equipment. It is most easily visualized
in a tensile test as the velocity of the testing machine head relative to its fixed base. Given
the deformation speed, strain rate is defined:
v
ð18:3Þ
e_ ¼
h
where e_ ¼ true strain rate, m/s/m (in/sec/in), or simply s–1; and h ¼ instantaneous height of
the workpiece being deformed, m (in). If deformation speed v is constant during the
operation, strain rate will change as h changes. In most practical forming operations,

work temperature.

plotted on log–log
coordinates.

valuation of strain rate is complicated by the geometry of the workpart and variations in
strain rate in different regions of the part. Strain rate can reach 1000 s–1 or more for some
metal forming processes such as high-speed rolling and forging.
We have already observed that the flow stress of a metal is a function of
temperature. At the temperatures of hot working, flow stress depends on strain rate.
The effect of strain rate on strength properties is known as strain rate sensitivity. The
effect can be seen in Figure 18.5. As strain rate is increased, resistance to deformation
increases. This usually plots approximately as a straight line on a log–log graph, thus
leading to the relationship:
Y f ¼ Ce_ m

ð18:4Þ

where C is the strength constant (similar but not equal to the strength coefficient in the
flow curve equation), and m is the strain rate sensitivity exponent. The value of C is
determined at a strain rate of 1.0, and m is the slope of the curve in Figure 18.5(b).

FIGURE 18.6 Effect of temperature on flow
stress for a typical metal. The constant C in
Eq. (18.4), indicated by the intersection of
each plot with the vertical dashed line at
strain rate ¼ 1.0, decreases, and m (slope of
each plot) increases with increasing
temperature.

The effect of temperature on the parameters of Eq. (18.4) is pronounced. Increasing temperature decreases the value of C (consistent with its effect on K in the flow curve
equation) and increases the value of m. The general result can be seen in Figure 18.6. At
room temperature, the effect of strain rate is almost negligible, indicating that the flow
curve is a good representation of the material behavior. As temperature is increased,
strain rate plays a more important role in determining flow stress, as indicated by the
steeper slopes of the strain rate relationships. This is important in hot working because
deformation resistance of the material increases so dramatically as strain rate is
increased. To give a sense of the effect, typical values of m for the three temperature
ranges of metal working are given in Table 18.1.
Thus we see that even in cold working, strain rate can have an effect, if small, on flow
stress. In hot working, the effect can be significant. A more complete expression for flow
stress as a function of both strain and strain rate would be the following:
Y f ¼ Aen e_ m

ð18:5Þ

where A ¼ a strength coefficient, combining the effects of the previous K and C values. Of
course, A, n, and m would all be functions of temperature, and the enormous task of testing
and compiling the values of these parameters for different metals and various temperatures would be forbidding.
In our coverage of the various bulk deformation processes in Chapter 19, many of
which are performed hot, we neglect the effect of strain rate in analyzing forces and
power. For cold working and warm working, and for hot working operations at relatively
low deformation speeds, this neglect represents a reasonable assumption.

18.5

FRICTION AND LUBRICATION IN METAL FORMING
Friction in metal forming arises because of the close contact between the tool and work
surfaces and the high pressures that drive the surfaces together in these operations. In
most metal forming processes, friction is undesirable for the following reasons: (1) metal
flow in the work is retarded, causing residual stresses and sometimes defects in the
product; (2) forces and power to perform the operation are increased, and (3) tool wear
can lead to loss of dimensional accuracy, resulting in defective parts and requiring
replacement of the tooling. Since tools in metal forming are generally expensive, tool
wear is a major concern. Friction and tool wear are more severe in hot working because of
the much harsher environment.
Friction in metal forming is different from that encountered in most mechanical
systems, such as gear trains, shafts and bearings, and other components involving relative
motion between surfaces. These other cases are generally characterized by low contact
pressures, low to moderate temperatures, and ample lubrication to minimize metal-tometal contact. By contrast, the metal forming environment features high pressures between
a hardened tool and a soft workpart, plastic deformation of the softer material, and high

E1C18

Chapter 18/Fundamentals of Metal Forming

temperatures (at least in hot working). These conditions can result in relatively high
coefficients of friction in metal working, even in the presence of lubricants. Typical values of
coefficient of friction for the three categories of metal forming are listed in Table 18.1.
If the coefficient of friction becomes large enough, a condition known as sticking
occurs. Sticking in metalworking (also called sticking friction) is the tendency for the two
surfaces in relative motion to adhere to each other rather than slide. It means that the
friction stress between the surfaces exceeds the shear flow stress of the work metal, thus
causing the metal to deform by a shear process beneath the surface rather than slip at the
surface. Sticking occurs in metal forming operations and is a prominent problem in rolling;
we discuss it in that context in the following chapter.
Metalworking lubricants are applied to the tool–work interface in many forming
operations to reduce the harmful effects of friction. Benefits include reduced sticking,
forces, power, and tool wear; and better surface finish on the product. Lubricants also serve
other functions, such as removing heat from the tooling. Considerations in choosing an
appropriate metalworking lubricant include (1) type of forming process (rolling, forging,
sheet metal drawing, and so on), (2) whether used in hot working or cold working, (3) work
material, (4) chemical reactivity with the tool and work metals (it is generally desirable for
the lubricant to adhere to the surfaces to be most effective in reducing friction), (5) ease of
application, (6) toxicity, (7) flammability, and (8) cost.
Lubricants used for cold working operations include [4], [7] mineral oils, fats and
fatty oils, water-based emulsions, soaps, and other coatings. Hot working is sometimes
performed dry for certain operations and materials (e.g., hot rolling of steel and extrusion
of aluminum). When lubricants are used in hot working, they include mineral oils,
graphite, and glass. Molten glass becomes an effective lubricant for hot extrusion of steel
alloys. Graphite contained in water or mineral oil is a common lubricant for hot forging of
various work materials. More detailed treatments of lubricants in metalworking are
found in references [7] and [9].

The deformation processes described in this chapter accomplish significant shape change in metal parts whose
initial form is bulk rather than sheet. The starting forms
include cylindrical bars and billets, rectangular billets and
slabs, and similar elementary geometries. The bulk deformation processes refine the starting shapes, sometimes
improving mechanical properties, and always adding commercial value. Deformation processes work by stressing the
metal sufficiently to cause it to plastically flow into the
desired shape.
Bulk deformation processes are performed as cold,
warm, and hot working operations. Cold and warm working
is appropriate when the shape change is less severe, and there
is a need to improve mechanical properties and achieve good
finish on the part. Hot working is generally required when
massive deformation of large workparts is involved.
The commercial and technological importance of
bulk deformation processes derives from the following:
å When performed as hot working operations, they can
achieve significant change in the shape of the workpart.
å When performed as cold working operations, they can
be used not only to shape the product, but also to
increase its strength through strain hardening.
å These processes produce little or no waste as a byproduct of the operation. Some bulk deformation operations are near net shape or net shape processes; they
achieve final product geometry with little or no subsequent machining.
The bulk deformation processes covered in this chapter are (1) rolling, (2) forging, (3) extrusion, and (4) wire
and bar drawing. The chapter also documents the variations
and related operations of the four basic processes that have
been developed over the years.

Chapter 19/Bulk Deformation Processes in Metal Working

19.1 ROLLING
Rolling is a deformation process in which the thickness of the work is reduced by compressive
forces exerted by two opposing rolls. The rolls rotate as illustrated in Figure 19.1 to pull and
simultaneously squeeze the work between them. The basic process shown in our figure is flat
rolling, used to reduce the thickness of a rectangular cross section. A closely related process is
shape rolling, in which a square cross section is formed into a shape such as an I-beam.
Most rolling processes are very capital intensive, requiring massive pieces of equipment, called rolling mills, to perform them. The high investment cost requires the mills to be
used for production in large quantities of standard items such as sheets and plates. Most
rolling is carried out by hot working, called hot rolling, owing to the large amount of
deformation required. Hot-rolled metal is generally free of residual stresses, and its
properties are isotropic. Disadvantages of hot rolling are that the product cannot be
held to close tolerances, and the surface has a characteristic oxide scale.
Steelmaking provides the most common application of rolling mill operations (Historical Note 19.1). Let us follow the sequence of steps in a steel rolling mill to illustrate the
variety of products made. Similar steps occur in other basic metal industries. The work starts
out as a cast steel ingot that has just solidified. While it is still hot, the ingot is placed in a
furnace where it remains for many hours until it has reached a uniform temperature
throughout, so that the metal will flow consistently during rolling. For steel, the desired
temperature for rolling is around 1200 C (2200 F). The heating operation is called soaking,
and the furnaces in which it is carried out are called soaking pits.
From soaking, the ingot is moved to the rolling mill, where it is rolled into one of three
intermediate shapes called blooms, billets, or slabs. A bloom has a square cross section 150
mm  150 mm (6 in  6 in) or larger. A slab is rolled from an ingot or a bloom and has a
rectangular cross section of width 250 mm (10 in) or more and thickness 40 mm (1.5 in) or
more. A billet is rolled from a bloom and is square with dimensions 40 mm (1.5 in) on a side
or larger. These intermediate shapes are subsequently rolled into final product shapes.
Blooms are rolled into structural shapes and rails for railroad tracks. Billets are rolled
into bars and rods. These shapes are the raw materials for machining, wire drawing, forging,
and other metalworking processes. Slabs are rolled into plates, sheets, and strips. Hot-rolled
plates are used in shipbuilding, bridges, boilers, welded structures for various heavy
machines, tubes and pipes, and many other products. Figure 19.2 shows some of these
rolled steel products. Further flattening of hot-rolled plates and sheets is often accomplished by cold rolling, in order to prepare them for subsequent sheet metal operations
(Chapter 20). Cold rolling strengthens the metal and permits a tighter tolerance on
thickness. In addition, the surface of the cold-rolled sheet is absent of scale and generally
superior to the corresponding hot-rolled product. These characteristics make cold-rolled
sheets, strips, and coils ideal for stampings, exterior panels, and other parts of products
ranging from automobiles to appliances and office furniture.

Rolling

R

olling of gold and silver by manual methods dates
from the fourteenth century. Leonardo da Vinci designed
one of the first rolling mills in 1480, but it is doubtful that
his design was ever built. By around 1600, cold rolling of
lead and tin was accomplished on manually operated
rolling mills. By around 1700, hot rolling of iron was
being done in Belgium, England, France, Germany, and
Sweden. These mills were used to roll iron bars into
sheets. Prior to this time, the only rolls in steelmaking
were slitting mills—pairs of opposing rolls with collars
(cutting disks) used to slit iron and steel into narrow strips
for making nails and similar products. Slitting mills were
not intended to reduce thickness.

Modern rolling practice dates from 1783 when a patent
was issued in England for using grooved rolls to produce
iron bars. The Industrial Revolution created a tremendous
demand for iron and steel, stimulating developments in
rolling. The first mill for rolling railway rails was started in
1820 in England. The first I-beams were rolled in France in
1849. In addition, the size and capacity of flat rolling mills
increased dramatically during this period.
Rolling is a process that requires a very large power
source. Water wheels were used to power rolling mills
until the eighteenth century. Steam engines increased the
capacity of these rolling mills until soon after 1900 when
electric motors replaced steam.

19.1.1 FLAT ROLLING AND ITS ANALYSIS
Flat rolling is illustrated in Figures 19.1 and 19.3. It involves the rolling of slabs, strips,
sheets, and plates—workparts of rectangular cross section in which the width is greater
than the thickness. In flat rolling, the work is squeezed between two rolls so that its
thickness is reduced by an amount called the draft:
d ¼ to  tf

ð19:1Þ

where d ¼ draft, mm (in); to ¼ starting thickness, mm (in); and tf ¼ final thickness, mm
(in). Draft is sometimes expressed as a fraction of the starting stock thickness, called the

ð19:2Þ

where r ¼ reduction. When a series of rolling operations are used, reduction is taken as
the sum of the drafts divided by the original thickness.
In addition to thickness reduction, rolling usually increases work width. This is
called spreading, and it tends to be most pronounced with low width-to-thickness ratios
and low coefficients of friction. Conservation of matter is preserved, so the volume of
metal exiting the rolls equals the volume entering
t o wo Lo ¼ t f wf Lf

ð19:3Þ

where wo and wf are the before and after work widths, mm (in); and Lo and Lf are the before
and after work lengths, mm (in). Similarly, before and after volume rates of material flow
must be the same, so the before and after velocities can be related:
to wo vo ¼ tf wf vf

ð19:4Þ

where vo and vf are the entering and exiting velocities of the work.
The rolls contact the work along an arc defined by the angle u. Each roll has radius
R, and its rotational speed gives it a surface velocity vr. This velocity is greater than the
entering speed of the work vo and less than its exiting speed vf. Since the metal flow is
continuous, there is a gradual change in velocity of the work between the rolls. However,
there is one point along the arc where work velocity equals roll velocity. This is called the
no-slip point, also known as the neutral point. On either side of this point, slipping and
friction occur between roll and work. The amount of slip between the rolls and the work
can be measured by means of the forward slip, a term used in rolling that is defined:
s¼

vf  vr

ð19:5Þ

where s ¼ forward slip; vf ¼ final (exiting) work velocity, m/s (ft/sec); and vr ¼ roll speed,
m/s (ft/sec).
The true strain experienced by the work in rolling is based on before and after stock
thicknesses. In equation form,
e ¼ ln

ð19:6Þ

The true strain can be used to determine the average flow stress Y f applied to the work
material in flat rolling. Recall from the previous chapter, Eq. (18.2), that
Yf ¼

ð19:7Þ

The average flow stress is used to compute estimates of force and power in rolling.
Friction in rolling occurs with a certain coefficient of friction, and the compression force
of the rolls, multiplied by this coefficient of friction, results in a friction force between the rolls
and the work. On the entrance side of the no-slip point, friction force is in one direction, and on
the other side it is in the opposite direction. However, the two forces are not equal. The friction
force on the entrance side is greater, so that the net force pulls the work through the rolls. If this
were not the case, rolling would not be possible. There is a limit to the maximum possible
draft that can be accomplished in flat rolling with a given coefficient of friction, defined by:
dmax ¼ m2 R

where dmax ¼ maximum draft, mm (in); m ¼ coefficient of friction; and R ¼ roll radius mm
(in). The equation indicates that if friction were zero, draft would be zero, and it would be
impossible to accomplish the rolling operation.
Coefficient of friction in rolling depends on lubrication, work material, and
working temperature. In cold rolling, the value is around 0.1; in warm working, a typical
value is around 0.2; and in hot rolling, m is around 0.4 [16]. Hot rolling is often
characterized by a condition called sticking, in which the hot work surface adheres
to the rolls over the contact arc. This condition often occurs in the rolling of steels and
high-temperature alloys. When sticking occurs, the coefficient of friction can be as high
as 0.7. The consequence of sticking is that the surface layers of the work are restricted to
move at the same speed as the roll speed vr; and below the surface, deformation is more
severe in order to allow passage of the piece through the roll gap.
Given a coefficient of friction sufficient to perform rolling, roll force F required to
maintain separation between the two rolls can be computed by integrating the unit roll
pressure (shown as p in Figure 19.3) over the roll-work contact area. This can be expressed:
ZL
F¼w

ð19:9Þ

0

where F ¼ rolling force, N (lb); w ¼ the width of the work being rolled, mm (in); p ¼
roll pressure, MPa (lb/in2); and L ¼ length of contact between rolls and work, mm (in).
The integration requires two separate terms, one for either side of the neutral point.
Variation in roll pressure along the contact length is significant. A sense of this
variation can be obtained from the plot in Figure 19.4. Pressure reaches a maximum
at the neutral point, and trails off on either side to the entrance and exit points. As
friction increases, maximum pressure increases relative to entrance and exit values. As
friction decreases, the neutral point shifts away from the entrance and toward the exit
in order to maintain a net pull force in the direction of rolling. Otherwise, with low
friction, the work would slip rather than pass between the rolls.
An approximation of the results obtained by Eq. (19.9) can be calculated based
on the average flow stress experienced by the work material in the roll gap. That is,
F ¼ Y f wL

The torque in rolling can be estimated by assuming that the roll force is centered on
the work as it passes between the rolls, and that it acts with a moment arm of one-half the
contact length L. Thus, torque for each roll is
T ¼ 0:5 FL

ð19:12Þ

The power required to drive each roll is the product of torque and angular velocity.
Angular velocity is 2pN, where N ¼ rotational speed of the roll. Thus, the power for each
roll is 2pNT. Substituting Eq. (19.12) for torque in this expression for power, and
doubling the value to account for the fact that a rolling mill consists of two powered
rolls, we get the following expression:
P ¼ 2pNFL

where P ¼ power, J/s or W (in-lb/min); N ¼ rotational speed, 1/s (rev/min); F ¼ rolling
force, N (lb); and L ¼ contact length, m (in).

Example 19.1 Flat
Rolling

A 300-mm-wide strip 25-mm thick is fed through a rolling mill with two powered rolls
each of radius ¼ 250 mm. The work thickness is to be reduced to 22 mm in one pass at a
roll speed of 50 rev/min. The work material has a flow curve defined by K ¼ 275 MPa and
n ¼ 0.15, and the coefficient of friction between the rolls and the work is assumed to be
0.12. Determine if the friction is sufficient to permit the rolling operation to be
accomplished. If so, calculate the roll force, torque, and horsepower.

From Eq. (19.8), the maximum possible draft for the given coefficient of friction is
dmax ¼ (0:12)2 (250) ¼ 3:6 mm
Since the maximum allowable draft exceeds the attempted reduction, the rolling
operation is feasible. To compute rolling force, we need the contact length L and the
average flow stress Y f . The contact length is given by Eq. (19.11):

Rolling force is determined from Eq. (19.10):

Torque required to drive each roll is given by Eq. (19.12):
T ¼ 0:5(1; 444; 786)(27; 4)(103 ) ¼ 19; 786 N-m
and the power is obtained from Eq. (19.13):

It can be seen from this example that large forces and power are required in rolling.
Inspection of Eqs. (19.10) and (19.13) indicates that force and/or power to roll a strip of a
given width and work material can be reduced by any of the following: (1) using hot rolling
rather than cold rolling to reduce strength and strain hardening (K and n) of the work
material; (2) reducing the draft in each pass; (3) using a smaller roll radius R to reduce force;
and (4) using a lower rolling speed N to reduce power.

19.1.2 SHAPE ROLLING
In shape rolling, the work is deformed into a contoured cross section. Products made by
shape rolling include construction shapes such as I-beams, L-beams, and U-channels; rails
for railroad tracks; and round and square bars and rods (see Figure 19.2). The process is
accomplished by passing the work through rolls that have the reverse of the desired shape.
Most of the principles that apply in flat rolling are also applicable to shape rolling.
Shaping rolls are more complicated; and the work, usually starting as a square shape,
requires a gradual transformation through several rolls in order to achieve the final cross
section. Designing the sequence of intermediate shapes and corresponding rolls is called
roll-pass design. Its goal is to achieve uniform deformation throughout the cross section in
each reduction. Otherwise, certain portions of the work are reduced more than others,
causing greater elongation in these sections. The consequence of nonuniform reduction can

E1C19

Chapter 19/Bulk Deformation Processes in Metal Working

be warping and cracking of the rolled product. Both horizontal and vertical rolls are utilized
to achieve consistent reduction of the work material.

19.1.3 ROLLING MILLS
Various rolling mill configurations are available to deal with the variety of applications and
technical problems in the rolling process. The basic rolling mill consists of two opposing rolls
and is referred to as a two-high rolling mill, shown in Figure 19.5(a). The rolls in these mills
have diameters in the range of 0.6 to 1.4 m (2.0–4.5 ft). The two-high configuration can be
either reversing or nonreversing. In the nonreversing mill, the rolls always rotate in the same
direction, and the work always passes through from the same side. The reversing mill allows
the direction of roll rotation to be reversed, so that the work can be passed through in either
direction. This permits a series of reductions to be made through the same set of rolls, simply
by passing through the work from opposite directions multiple times. The disadvantage of
the reversing configuration is the significant angular momentum possessed by large rotating
rolls and the associated technical problems involved in reversing the direction.
Several alternative arrangements are illustrated in Figure 19.5. In the three-high
configuration, Figure 19.5(b), there are three rolls in a vertical column, and the direction of
rotation of each roll remains unchanged. To achieve a series of reductions, the work can be
passed through from either side by raising or lowering the strip after each pass. The
equipment in a three-high rolling mill becomes more complicated, because an elevator
mechanism is needed to raise and lower the work.
As several of the previous equations indicate, advantages are gained in reducing roll
diameter. Roll-work contact length is reduced with a lower roll radius, and this leads to
lower forces, torque, and power. The four-high rolling mill uses two smaller-diameter rolls
to contact the work and two backing rolls behind them, as in Figure 19.5(c). Owing to the
high roll forces, these smaller rolls would deflect elastically between their end bearings as
the work passes through unless the larger backing rolls were used to support them. Another

roll configuration that allows smaller working rolls against the work is the cluster rolling
mill (Figure 19.5(d)).
To achieve higher throughput rates in standard products, a tandem rolling mill is often
used. This configuration consists of a series of rolling stands, as represented in Figure 19.5(e).
Although only three stands are shown in our sketch, a typical tandem rolling mill may have
eight or ten stands, each making a reduction in thickness or a refinement in shape of the work
passing through. With each rolling step, work velocity increases, and the problem of
synchronizing the roll speeds at each stand is a significant one.
Modern tandem rolling mills are often supplied directly by continuous casting
operations (Section 7.2.2). These setups achieve a high degree of integration among the
processes required to transform starting raw materials into finished products. Advantages
include elimination of soaking pits, reduction in floor space, and shorter manufacturing lead
times. These technical advantages translate into economic benefits for a mill that can
accomplish continuous casting and rolling.

19.2

OTHER DEFORMATION PROCESSES RELATED TO ROLLING
Several other bulk deformation processes use rolls to form the workpart. The operations
include thread rolling, ring rolling, gear rolling, and roll piercing.
Thread Rolling Thread rolling is used to form threads on cylindrical parts by rolling them
between two dies. It is the most important commercial process for mass producing external
threaded components (e.g., bolts and screws). The competing process is thread cutting
(Section 22.7.1). Most thread rolling operations are performed by cold working in thread
rolling machines. These machines are equipped with special dies that determine the size and
form of the thread. The dies are of two types: (1) flat dies, which reciprocate relative to each
other, as illustrated in Figure 19.6; and (2) round dies, which rotate relative to each other to
accomplish the rolling action.
Production rates in thread rolling can be high, ranging up to eight parts per second for
small bolts and screws. Not only are these rates significantly higher than thread cutting, but
there are other advantages over machining as well: (1) better material utilization,
(2) stronger threads due to work hardening, (3) smoother surface, and (4) better fatigue
resistance due to compressive stresses introduced by rolling.
Ring Rolling Ring rolling is a deformation process in which a thick-walled ring of smaller
diameter is rolled into a thin-walled ring of larger diameter. The before and after views of the

process are illustrated in Figure 19.7. As the thick-walled ring is compressed, the deformed
material elongates, causing the diameter of the ring to be enlarged. Ring rolling is usually
performed as a hot-working process for large rings and as a cold-working process for smaller
rings.
Applications of ring rolling include ball and roller bearing races, steel tires for railroad
wheels, and rings for pipes, pressure vessels, and rotating machinery. The ring walls are not
limited to rectangular cross sections; the process permits rolling of more complex shapes.
Thereareseveraladvantagesofringrollingoveralternativemethodsofmakingthesameparts:
raw material savings, ideal grain orientation for the application, and strengthening through
cold working.
Gear Rolling Gear rolling is a cold working process to produce certain gears. The
automotive industry is an important user of these products. The setup in gear rolling is
similar to thread rolling, except that the deformed features of the cylindrical blank or
disk are oriented parallel to its axis (or at an angle in the case of helical gears) rather
than spiraled as in thread rolling. Alternative production methods for gears include
several machining operations, discussed in Section 22.7.2. Advantages of gear rolling
compared to machining are similar to those of thread rolling: higher production rates,
better strength and fatigue resistance, and less material waste.
Roll Piercing Ring rolling is a specialized hot working process for making seamless
thick-walled tubes. It utilizes two opposing rolls, and hence it is grouped with the
rolling processes. The process is based on the principle that when a solid cylindrical
part is compressed on its circumference, as in Figure 19.8(a), high tensile stresses are

FIGURE 19.8 Roll piercing: (a) formation of internal stresses and cavity by compression of cylindrical part; and
(b) setup of Mannesmann roll mill for producing seamless tubing.

developed at its center. If compression is high enough, an internal crack is formed. In
roll piercing, this principle is exploited by the setup shown in Figure 19.8(b). Compressive stresses on a solid cylindrical billet are applied by two rolls, whose axes are
oriented at slight angles (6 ) from the axis of the billet, so that their rotation tends to
pull the billet through the rolls. A mandrel is used to control the size and finish of the
hole created by the action. The terms rotary tube piercing and Mannesmann process
are also used for this tube-making operation.

19.3

FORGING
Forging is a deformation process in which the work is compressed between two dies, using
either impact or gradual pressure to form the part. It is the oldest of the metal forming
operations, dating back to perhaps 5000 BCE (Historical Note 19.2). Today, forging is an
important industrial process used to make a variety of high-strength components for
automotive, aerospace, and other applications. These components include engine crankshafts
and connecting rods, gears, aircraft structural components, and jet engine turbine parts. In
addition, steel and other basic metals industries use forging to establish the basic form of large
components that are subsequently machined to final shape and dimensions.

Historical Note 19.2

T

Forging

he forging process dates from the earliest written
records of man, around 7000 years ago. There is
evidence that forging was used in ancient Egypt, Greece,
Persia, India, China, and Japan to make weapons,
jewelry, and a variety of implements. Craftsmen in the art
of forging during these times were held in high regard.
Engraved stone platens were used as impression dies
in the hammering of gold and silver in ancient Crete

around 1600 BCE. This evolved into the fabrication of
coins by a similar process around 800 BCE. More
complicated impression dies were used in Rome around
200 CE. The blacksmith’s trade remained relatively
unchanged for many centuries until the drop hammer
with guided ram was introduced near the end of the
eighteenth century. This development brought forging
practice into the Industrial Age.

Forging is carried out in many different ways. One way to classify the operations is by
working temperature. Most forging operations are performed hot or warm, owing to the
significant deformation demanded by the process and the need to reduce strength and
increase ductility of the work metal. However, cold forging is also very common for certain
products. The advantage of cold forging is the increased strength that results from strain
hardening of the component.
Either impact or gradual pressure is used in forging. The distinction derives more
from the type of equipment used than differences in process technology. A forging machine
that applies an impact load is called a forging hammer, while one that applies gradual
pressure is called a forging press.
Another difference among forging operations is the degree to which the flow of the
work metal is constrained by the dies. By this classification, there are three types of forging
operations, shown in Figure 19.9: (a) open-die forging, (b) impression-die forging, and (c)
flashless forging. In open-die forging, the work is compressed between two flat (or almost
flat) dies, thus allowing the metal to flow without constraint in a lateral direction relative to
the die surfaces. In impression-die forging, the die surfaces contain a shape or impression
that is imparted to the work during compression, thus constraining metal flow to a
significant degree. In this type of operation, a portion of the work metal flows beyond the

trimmed off later. In flashless forging, the work is completely constrained within the die
and no excess flash is produced. The volume of the starting workpiece must be controlled
very closely so that it matches the volume of the die cavity. The reader can obtain a good
sense of these operations in our video clip on forging.

and (3) impression-die forging.

19.3.1 OPEN-DIE FORGING
The simplest case of open-die forging involves compression of a workpart of cylindrical
cross section between two flat dies, much in the manner of a compression test (Section
3.1.2). This forging operation, known as upsetting or upset forging, reduces the height of
the work and increases its diameter.
Analysis of Open-Die Forging If open-die forging is carried out under ideal conditions of
no friction between work and die surfaces, then homogeneous deformation occurs, and the
radial flow of the material is uniform throughout its height, as pictured in Figure 19.10. Under
these ideal conditions, the true strain experienced by the work during the process can be
determined by

where ho ¼ starting height of the work, mm (in); and h ¼ the height at some intermediate
point in the process, mm (in). At the end of the compression stroke, h ¼ its final value hf,
and the true strain reaches its maximum value.
Estimates of force to perform upsetting can be calculated. The force required to
continue the compression at any given height h during the process can be obtained by
multiplying the corresponding cross-sectional area by the flow stress:
F ¼ Yf A

ð19:15Þ

where F ¼ force, lb (N); A ¼ cross-sectional area of the part, mm2 (in2); and Yf ¼ flow stress
corresponding to the strain given by Eq. (19.14), MPa (lb/in2). Area A continuously
increases during the operation as height is reduced. Flow stress Yf also increases as a result
of work hardening, except when the metal is perfectly plastic (e.g., in hot working). In this
case, the strain-hardening exponent n ¼ 0, and flow stress Yf equals the metal’s yield
strength Y. Force reaches a maximum value at the end of the forging stroke, when both area
and flow stress are at their highest values.
An actual upsetting operation does not occur quite as shown in Figure 19.10 because
friction opposes the flow of work metal at the die surfaces. This creates the barreling effect
shown in Figure 19.11. When performed on a hot workpart with cold dies, the barreling
effect is even more pronounced. This results from a higher coefficient of friction typical in
hot working and heat transfer at and near the die surfaces, which cools the metal and
increases its resistance to deformation. The hotter metal in the middle of the part flows more
readily than the cooler metal at the ends. These effects are more significant as the diameter-

to-height ratio of the workpart increases, due to the greater contact area at the work–die
interface.
All of these factors cause the actual upsetting force to be greater than what is
predicted by Eq. (19.15). As an approximation, we can apply a shape factor to Eq. (19.15)
to account for effects of the D/h ratio and friction:
F ¼ Kf Y f A

where m ¼ coefficient of friction; D ¼ workpart diameter or other dimension representing

Example 19.2
Open-Die Forging

A cylindrical workpiece is subjected to a cold upset forging operation. The starting piece is 75
mm in height and 50 mm in diameter. It is reduced in the operation to a height of 36 mm. The
work material has a flow curve defined by K ¼ 350 MPa and n ¼ 0.17. Assume a coefficient of
friction of 0.1. Determine the force as the process begins, at intermediate heights of 62 mm,
49 mm, and at the final height of 36 mm.
Solution: Workpiece volume V ¼ 75p(502=4) ¼ 147,262 mm3. At the moment contact is
made by the upper die, h ¼ 75 mm and the force F ¼ 0. At the start of yielding, h is slightly less
than 75 mm, and we assume that strain ¼ 0.002, at which the flow stress is
Y f ¼ Ken ¼ 350(0:002)0:17 ¼ 121:7 MPa
The diameter is still approximately D ¼ 50 mm and area A ¼ p(502=4) ¼ 1963.5 mm2. For

rings. In some applications, the dies have slightly contoured surfaces that help to shape the
work. In addition, the work must often be manipulated (e.g., rotating in steps) to effect the
desired shape change. Skill of the human operator is a factor in the success of these
operations. An example of open-die forging in the steel industry is the shaping of a large
square cast ingot into a round cross section. Open-die forging operations produce rough
forms, and subsequent operations are required to refine the parts to final geometry and
dimensions. An important contribution of open-die hot-forging is that it creates a favorable
grain flow and metallurgical structure in the metal.
Operations classified as open-die forging or related operations include fullering,
edging, and cogging, illustrated in Figure 19.13. Fullering is a forging operation performed to reduce the cross section and redistribute the metal in a workpart in preparation
for subsequent shape forging. It is accomplished by dies with convex surfaces. Fullering
die cavities are often designed into multi-cavity impression dies, so that the starting bar
can be rough formed before final shaping. Edging is similar to fullering, except that the
dies have concave surfaces.
A cogging operation consists of a sequence of forging compressions along the
length of a workpiece to reduce cross section and increase length. It is used in the steel
industry to produce blooms and slabs from cast ingots. It is accomplished using open dies
with flat or slightly contoured surfaces. The term incremental forging is sometimes used
for this process.

19.3.2 IMPRESSION-DIE FORGING
Impression-die forging, sometimes called closed-die forging, is performed with dies that
contain the inverse of the desired shape of the part. The process is illustrated in a three-step
sequence in Figure 19.14. The raw workpiece is shown as a cylindrical part similar to that used
in the previous open-die operation. As the die closes to its final position, flash is formed by
metal that flows beyond the die cavity and into the small gap between the die plates. Although
this flash must be cut away from the part in a subsequent trimming operation, it actually
serves an important function during impression-die forging. As the flash begins to form in the

die gap, friction resists continued flow of metal into the gap, thus constraining the bulk of the
work material to remain in the die cavity. In hot forging, metal flow is further restricted
because the thin flash cools quickly against the die plates, thereby increasing its resistance to
deformation. Restricting metal flow in the gap causes the compression pressures on the part
to increase significantly, thus forcing the material to fill the sometimes intricate details of the
die cavity to ensure a high-quality product.

Several forming steps are often required in impression-die forging to transform the
starting blank into the desired final geometry. Separate cavities in the die are needed for
each step. The beginning steps are designed to redistribute the metal in the workpart to
achieve a uniform deformation and desired metallurgical structure in the subsequent steps.
The final steps bring the part to its final geometry. In addition, when drop forging is used,
several blows of the hammer may be required for each step. When impression-die drop
forging is done manually, as it often is, considerable operator skill is required under adverse
conditions to achieve consistent results.
Because of flashformation inimpression-dieforging and the more complex partshapes
made with these dies, forces in this process are significantly greater and more difficult to
analyzethaninopen-dieforging. Relatively simpleformulas anddesign factors areoftenused
to estimate forces in impression-die forging. The force formula is the same as previous Eq.
(19.16) for open-die forging, but its interpretation is slightly different:
F ¼ Kf Y f A

ð19:18Þ

where F ¼ maximum force in the operation, N (lb); A ¼ projected area of the part including
flash, mm2 (in2); Yf ¼ flow stress of the material, MPa (lb/in2); and Kf ¼ forging shape
factor. In hot forging, the appropriate value of Yf is the yield strength of the metal at the
elevated temperature. In other cases, selecting the proper value of flow stress is difficult
because the strain varies throughout the workpiece for complex shapes. Kf in Eq. (19.18) is a
factor intended to account for increases in force required to forge part shapes of various
complexities. Table 19.1 indicates the range of values of Kf for different part geometries.
Obviously, the problem of specifying the proper Kf value for a given workpart limits the
accuracy of the force estimate.
Eq. (19.18) applies to the maximum force during the operation, since this is the load that
will determine the required capacity of the press or hammer used in the operation. The
maximum force is reached at the end of the forging stroke, when the projected area is greatest
and friction is maximum.
Impression-die forging is not capable of close tolerance work, and machining is
often required to achieve the accuracies needed. The basic geometry of the part is
obtained from the forging process, with machining performed on those portions of the
part that require precision finishing (e.g., holes, threads, and surfaces that mate with other
components). The advantages of forging, compared to machining the part completely, are
higher production rates, conservation of metal, greater strength, and favorable grain
orientation of the metal that results from forging. A comparison of the grain flow in
forging and machining is illustrated in Figure 19.15.
Improvements in the technology of impression-die forging have resulted in the
capability to produce forgings with thinner sections, more complex geometries, drastic
reductions in draft requirements on the dies, closer tolerances, and the virtual elimination
of machining allowances. Forging processes with these features are known as precision
forging. Common work metals used for precision forging include aluminum and titanium. A
comparison of precision and conventional impression-die forging is presented in Figure 19.16.
Note that precision forging in this example does not eliminate flash, although it reduces it.

Some precision forging operations are accomplished without producing flash. Depending on
whether machining is required to finish the part geometry, precision forgings are properly
classified as near net shape or net shape processes.

19.3.3 FLASHLESS FORGING
As mentioned above, impression-die forging is sometimes called closed-die forging in
industry terminology. However, there is a technical distinction between impression-die
forging and true closed-die forging. The distinction is that in closed-die forging, the raw
workpiece is completely contained within the die cavity during compression, and no flash is
formed. The process sequence is illustrated in Figure 19.17. The term flashless forging is
appropriate to identify this process.
Flashless forging imposes requirements on process control that are more demanding than impression-die forging. Most important is that the work volume must equal the
space in the die cavity within a very close tolerance. If the starting blank is too large,
excessive pressures may cause damage to the die or press. If the blank is too small, the
cavity will not be filled. Because of the special demands made by flashless forging, the
process lends itself best to part geometries that are usually simple and symmetrical, and to
work materials such as aluminum and magnesium and their alloys. Flashless forging is often
classified as a precision forging process [5].
Forces in flashless forging reach values comparable to those in impression-die
forging. Estimates of these forces can be computed using the same methods as for
impression-die forging: Eq. (19.18) and Table 19.1.
Coining is a special application of closed-die forging in which fine details in the die
are impressed into the top and bottom surfaces of the workpart. There is little flow of
metal in coining, yet the pressures required to reproduce the surface details in the die
cavity are high, as indicated by the value of Kf in Table 19.1. A common application of

coining is, of course, in the minting of coins, shown in Figure 19.18. The process is also
used to provide good surface finish and dimensional accuracy on workparts made by
other operations.

19.3.4 FORGING HAMMERS, PRESSES, AND DIES
Equipment used in forging consists of forging machines, classified as hammers or presses,
and forging dies, which are the special tooling used in these machines. In addition, auxiliary
equipment is needed, such as furnaces to heat the work, mechanical devices to load and
unload the work, and trimming stations to cut away the flash in impression-die forging.
Forging Hammers Forging hammers operate by applying an impact loading against the
work. The term drop hammer is often used for these machines, owing to the means of
delivering impact energy (see Figures 19.19 and 19.20). Drop hammers are most frequently

used for impression-die forging. The upper portion of the forging die is attached to the ram,
and the lower portion is attached to the anvil. In the operation, the work is placed on the lower
die, and the ram is lifted and then dropped. When the upper die strikes the work, the impact
energy causes the part to assume the form of the die cavity. Several blows of the hammer are
often required to achieve the desired change in shape. Drop hammers can be classified as
gravity drop hammers and power drop hammers. Gravity drop hammers achieve their energy
by the falling weight of a heavy ram. The force of the blow is determined by the height of the
drop and the weight of the ram. Power drop hammers accelerate the ram by pressurized air or
steam. One of the disadvantages of drop hammers is that a large amount of the impact energy
is transmitted through the anvil and into the floor of the building.

FIGURE 19.21
Terminology for a
conventional impressiondie in forging.

Forging Presses Presses apply gradual pressure, rather than sudden impact, to accomplish
the forging operation. Forging presses include mechanical presses, hydraulic presses, and
screw presses. Mechanical presses operate by means of eccentrics, cranks, or knuckle joints,
which convert the rotating motion of a drive motor into the translation motion of the ram.
These mechanisms are very similar to those used in stamping presses (Section 20.5.2).
Mechanical presses typically achieve very high forces at the bottom of the forging stroke.
Hydraulic presses use a hydraulically driven piston to actuate the ram. Screw presses apply
force by a screw mechanism that drives the vertical ram. Both screw drive and hydraulic drive
operate at relatively low ram speeds and can provide a constant force throughout the stroke.
These machines are therefore suitable for forging (and other forming) operations that require
a long stroke.
Forging Dies Proper die design is important in the success of a forging operation. Parts to
be forged must be designed based on knowledge of the principles and limitations of this
process. Our purpose here is to describe some of the terminology and guidelines used in the
design of forgings and forging dies. Design of open dies is generally straightforward because
the dies are relatively simple in shape. Our comments apply to impression dies and closed
dies. Figure 19.21 defines some of the terminology in an impression die.
We indicate some of the principles and limitations that must be considered in the
part design or in the selection of forging as the manufacturing process to make the part in
the following discussion of forging die terminology [5]:
å Parting line. The parting line is the plane that divides the upper die from the lower die.
Called the flash line in impression-die forging, it is the plane where the two die halves
meet. Its selection by the designer affects grain flow in the part, required load, and flash
formation.
å Draft. Draft is the amount of taper on the sides of the part required to remove it from
the die. The term also applies to the taper on the sides of the die cavity. Typical draft
angles are 3 on aluminum and magnesium parts and 5 to 7 on steel parts. Draft angles
on precision forgings are near zero.
å Webs and ribs. A web is a thin portion of the forging that is parallel to the parting line,
while a rib is a thin portion that is perpendicular to the parting line. These part features
cause difficulty in metal flow as they become thinner.
å Fillet and corner radii. Fillet and corner radii are illustrated in Figure 19.21. Small
radii tend to limit metal flow and increase stresses on die surfaces during forging.
å Flash. Flash formation plays a critical role in impression-die forging by causing
pressure buildup inside the die to promote filling of the cavity. This pressure buildup

E1C19

Chapter 19/Bulk Deformation Processes in Metal Working

is controlled by designing a flash land and gutter into the die, as pictured in Figure 19.21.
The land determines the surface area along which lateral flow of metal occurs, thereby
controlling the pressure increase inside the die. The gutter permits excess metal to
escape without causing the forging load to reach extreme values.

19.4 OTHER DEFORMATION PROCESSES RELATED TO FORGING
In addition to the conventional forging operations discussed in the preceding sections,
other metal forming operations are closely associated with forging.
Upsetting and Heading Upsetting (also called upset forging) is a deformation operation
in which a cylindrical workpart is increased in diameter and reduced in length. This operation
was analyzed in our discussion of open-die forging (Section 19.3.1). However, as an industrial
operation, it can also be performed as closed-die forging, as seen in Figure 19.22.
Upsetting is widely used in the fastener industry to form heads on nails, bolts, and
similar hardware products. In these applications, the term heading is often used to denote the
operation. Figure 19.23 illustrates a variety of heading applications, indicating various
possible die configurations. Owing to these types of applications, more parts are produced

follows: (1) wire stock is fed to the stop; (2) gripping dies close on the stock and the stop is retracted; (3) punch
moves forward; and (4) bottoms to form the head.

by upsetting than by any other forging operation. It is performed as a mass-production
operation—cold, warm, or hot—on special upset forging machines, called headers or formers.
These machines are usually equipped with horizontal slides, rather than vertical slides as in
conventional forging hammers and presses. Long wire or bar stock is fed into the machines,
the end of the stock is upset forged, and then the piece is cut to length to make the desired
hardware item. For bolts and screws, thread rolling (Section 19.2) is used to form the threads.
There are limits on the amount of deformation that can be achieved in upsetting,
usually defined as the maximum length of stock to be forged. The maximum length that can
be upset in one blow is three times the diameter of the starting stock. Otherwise, the metal
bends or buckles instead of compressing properly to fill the cavity.
Swaging and Radial Forging Swaging and radial forging are forging processes used to
reduce the diameter of a tube or solid rod. Swaging is often performed on the end of a
workpiece to create a tapered section. The swaging process, shown in Figure 19.24, is
accomplished by means of rotating dies that hammer a workpiece radially inward to taper it
as the piece is fed into the dies. Figure 19.25 illustrates some of the shapes and products that
are made by swaging. A mandrel is sometimes required to control the shape and size of the
internal diameter of tubular parts that are swaged. Radial forging is similar to swaging in its
action against the work and is used to create similar part shapes. The difference is that in radial
forging the dies do not rotate around the workpiece; instead, the work is rotated as it feeds
into the hammering dies.
Roll Forging Roll forging is a deformation process used to reduce the cross section of a
cylindrical (or rectangular) workpiece by passing it through a set of opposing rolls that have
grooves matching the desired shape of the final part. The typical operation is illustrated in
Figure 19.26. Roll forging is generally classified as a forging process even though it utilizes
rolls. The rolls do not turn continuously in roll forging, but rotate through only a portion of
one revolution corresponding to the desired deformation to be accomplished on the part.

FIGURE 19.26
Roll forging.

Roll-forged parts are generally stronger and possess favorable grain structure compared to
competing processes such as machining that might be used to produce the same part
geometry.
Orbital Forging In this process, deformation occurs by means of a cone-shaped upper die
that is simultaneously rolled and pressed into the workpart. As illustrated in Figure 19.27,
the work is supported on a lower die, which has a cavity into which the work is compressed.
Because the axis of the cone is inclined, only a small area of the work surface is compressed
at any moment. As the upper die revolves, the area under compression also revolves. These
operating characteristics of orbital forging result in a substantial reduction in press load
required to accomplish deformation of the work.

Hubbing: (1) before

the process is completed.
Note that the excess
material formed by the
penetration of the hub
must be machined away.

Hubbing Hubbing is a deformation process in which a hardened steel form is pressed
into a soft steel (or other soft metal) block. The process is often used to make mold cavities
for plastic molding and die casting, as sketched in Figure 19.28. The hardened steel form,
called the hub, is machined to the geometry of the part to be molded. Substantial pressures
are required to force the hub into the soft block, and this is usually accomplished by a
hydraulic press. Complete formation of the die cavity in the block often requires several
steps—hubbing followed by annealing to recover the work metal from strain hardening.
When significant amounts of material are deformed in the block, as shown in our
figure, the excess must be machined away. The advantage of hubbing in this application is
that it is generally easier to machine the positive form than the mating negative cavity.
This advantage is multiplied in cases where more than one cavity are made in the die
block.
Isothermal Forging Isothermal forging is a term applied to a hot-forging operation in
which the workpart is maintained at or near its starting elevated temperature during
deformation, usually by heating the forging dies to the same elevated temperature. By
avoiding chill of the workpiece on contact with the cold die surfaces as in conventional
forging, the metal flows more readily and the force required to perform the process is
reduced. Isothermal forging is more expensive than conventional forging and is usually
reserved for difficult-to-forge metals, such as titanium and superalloys, and for complex
part shapes. The process is sometimes carried out in a vacuum to avoid rapid oxidation of
the die material. Similar to isothermal forging is hot-die forging, in which the dies are
heated to a temperature that is somewhat below that of the work metal.
Trimming Trimming is an operation used to remove flash on the workpart in impression-die forging. In most cases, trimming is accomplished by shearing, as in Figure 19.29,
in which a punch forces the work through a cutting die, the blades for which have the
profile of the desired part. Trimming is usually done while the work is still hot, which
means that a separate trimming press is included at each forging hammer or press. In
cases where the work might be damaged by the cutting process, trimming may be done by
alternative methods, such as grinding or sawing.

19.5 EXTRUSION
Extrusion is a compression process in which the work metal is forced to flow through a die
opening to produce a desired cross-sectional shape. The process can be likened to squeezing
toothpaste out of a toothpaste tube. Extrusion dates from around 1800 (Historical Note
19.3). There are several advantages of the modern process: (1) a variety of shapes are
possible, especially with hot extrusion; (2) grain structure and strength properties are
enhanced in cold and warm extrusion; (3) fairly close tolerances are possible, especially in
cold extrusion; and (4) in some extrusion operations, little or no wasted material is created.
However, a limitation is that the cross section of the extruded part must be uniform
throughout its length.

Historical Note 19.3

Extrusion

E

xtrusion as an industrial process was invented around
1800 in England, during the Industrial Revolution when
that country was leading the world in technological
innovations. The invention consisted of the first hydraulic
press for extruding lead pipes. An important step forward

was made in Germany around 1890, when the first
horizontal extrusion press was built for extruding metals
with higher melting points than lead. The feature that
made this possible was the use of a dummy block that
separated the ram from the work billet.

19.5.1 TYPES OF EXTRUSION
Extrusion is carried out in various ways. One important distinction is between direct extrusion
and indirect extrusion. Another classification is by working temperature: cold, warm, or hot
extrusion. Finally, extrusion is performed as either a continuous process or a discrete process.
Direct versus Indirect Extrusion Direct extrusion (also called forward extrusion) is
illustrated in Figure 19.30. A metal billet is loaded into a container, and a ram
compresses the material, forcing it to flow through one or more openings in a die at
the opposite end of the container. As the ram approaches the die, a small portion of the
billet remains that cannot be forced through the die opening. This extra portion, called
the butt, is separated from the product by cutting it just beyond the exit of the die.

421

Direct

One of the problems in direct extrusion is the significant friction that exists between the
work surface and the walls of the container as the billet is forced to slide toward the die
opening. This friction causes a substantial increase in the ram force required in direct
extrusion. In hot extrusion, the friction problem is aggravated by the presence of an oxide
layer on the surface of the billet. This oxide layer can cause defects in the extruded product. To
address these problems, a dummy block is often used between the ram and the work billet.
The diameter of the dummy block is slightly smaller than the billet diameter, so that a narrow
ring of work metal (mostly the oxide layer) is left in the container, leaving the final product
free of oxides.
Hollow sections (e.g., tubes) are possible in direct extrusion by the process setup in
Figure19.31.Thestartingbilletispreparedwithaholeparalleltoitsaxis.Thisallowspassageofa
mandrel that is attached to the dummy block. As the billet is compressed, the material is forced
to flow through the clearance between the mandrel and the die opening. The resulting cross
section is tubular. Semi-hollow cross-sectional shapes are usually extruded in the same way.
The starting billet in direct extrusion is usually round in cross section, but the final
shape is determined by the shape of the die opening. Obviously, the largest dimension of
the die opening must be smaller than the diameter of the billet.
In indirect extrusion, also called backward extrusion and reverse extrusion, Figure 19.32(a), the die is mounted to the ram rather than at the opposite end of the container.
As the ram penetrates into the work, the metal is forced to flow through the clearance in a

direction opposite to the motion of the ram. Since the billet is not forced to move relative
to the container, there is no friction at the container walls, and the ram force is therefore lower
than in direct extrusion. Limitations of indirect extrusion are imposed by the lower rigidity of
the hollow ram and the difficulty in supporting the extruded product as it exits the die.
Indirect extrusion can produce hollow (tubular) cross sections, as in Figure 19.32(b). In
this method, the ram is pressed into the billet, forcing the material to flow around the ram and
take a cup shape. There are practical limitations on the length of the extruded part that can be
made by this method. Support of the ram becomes a problem as work length increases.
Hot versus Cold Extrusion Extrusion can be performed either hot or cold, depending on
work metal and amount of strain to which it is subjected during deformation. Metals that are
typically extruded hot include aluminum, copper, magnesium, zinc, tin, and their alloys.
These same metals are sometimes extruded cold. Steel alloys are usually extruded hot,
although the softer, more ductile grades are sometimes cold extruded (e.g., low carbon steels
and stainless steel). Aluminum is probably the most ideal metal for extrusion (hot and cold),
and many commercial aluminum products are made by this process (structural shapes, door
and window frames, etc.).
Hot extrusion involves prior heating of the billet to a temperature above its
recrystallization temperature. This reduces strength and increases ductility of the
metal, permitting more extreme size reductions and more complex shapes to be
achieved in the process. Additional advantages include reduction of ram force,
increased ram speed, and reduction of grain flow characteristics in the final product.
Cooling of the billet as it contacts the container walls is a problem, and isothermal
extrusion is sometimes used to overcome this problem. Lubrication is critical in hot
extrusion for certain metals (e.g., steels), and special lubricants have been developed
that are effective under the harsh conditions in hot extrusion. Glass is sometimes used
as a lubricant in hot extrusion; in addition to reducing friction, it also provides effective
thermal insulation between the billet and the extrusion container.
Cold extrusion and warm extrusion are generally used to produce discrete parts, often
in finished (or near finished) form. The term impact extrusion is used to indicate high-speed
cold extrusion, and this method is described in more detail in Section 19.5.4. Some important
advantages of cold extrusion include increased strength due to strain hardening, close
tolerances, improved surface finish, absence of oxide layers, and high production rates. Cold
extrusion at room temperature also eliminates the need for heating the starting billet.
Continuous versus Discrete Processing A true continuous process operates in steady
state mode for an indefinite period of time. Some extrusion operations approach this ideal

E1C19

423

by producing very long sections in one cycle, but these operations are ultimately limited by
the size of the starting billet that can be loaded into the extrusion container. These processes
are more accurately described as semi-continuous operations. In nearly all cases, the long
section is cut into smaller lengths in a subsequent sawing or shearing operation.
In a discrete extrusion operation, a single part is produced in each extrusion cycle.
Impact extrusion is an example of the discrete processing case.

19.5.2 ANALYSIS OF EXTRUSION
Let us use Figure 19.33 as a reference in discussing some of the parameters in extrusion. The
diagram assumes that both billet and extrudate are round in cross section. One important
parameter is the extrusion ratio, also called the reduction ratio. The ratio is defined:
Ao
rx ¼
ð19:19Þ
Af
where rx ¼ extrusion ratio; Ao ¼ cross-sectional area of the starting billet, mm2 (in2); and Af ¼
final cross-sectional area of the extruded section, mm2 (in2). The ratio applies for both direct
and indirect extrusion. The value of rx can be used to determine true strain in extrusion, given
that ideal deformation occurs with no friction and no redundant work:
Ao
e ¼ lnrx ¼ ln
ð19:20Þ
Af
Under the assumption of ideal deformation (no friction and no redundant work), the
pressure applied by the ram to compress the billet through the die opening depicted in our
figure can be computed as follows:
p ¼ Y f ln rx

ð19:21Þ

where Y f ¼ average flow stress during deformation, MPa (lb/in2). For convenience, we
restate Eq. (18.2) from the previous chapter:
Yf ¼

Ken
1þn

In fact, extrusion is not a frictionless process, and the previous equations grossly
underestimate the strain and pressure in an extrusion operation. Friction exists between
the die and the work as the billet squeezes down and passes through the die opening. In
direct extrusion, friction also exists between the container wall and the billet surface. The
effect of friction is to increase the strain experienced by the metal. Thus, the actual
pressure is greater than that given by Eq. (19.21), which assumes no friction.

Chapter 19/Bulk Deformation Processes in Metal Working

Various methods have been suggested to calculate the actual true strain and
associated ram pressure in extrusion [1], [3], [6], [11], [12], and [19]. The following
empirical equation proposed by Johnson [11] for estimating extrusion strain has gained
considerable recognition:
ex ¼ a þ b ln rx

ð19:22Þ

where ex ¼ extrusion strain; and a and b are empirical constants for a given die angle.
Typical values of these constants are: a ¼ 0.8 and b ¼ 1.2 to 1.5. Values of a and b tend to
increase with increasing die angle.
The ram pressure to perform indirect extrusion can be estimated based on
Johnson’s extrusion strain formula as follows:
p ¼ Y f ex

ð19:23aÞ

where Y f is calculated based on ideal strain from Eq. (19.20), rather than extrusion strain
in Eq. (19.22).
In direct extrusion, the effect of friction between the container walls and the billet
causes the ram pressure to be greater than for indirect extrusion. We can write the following
expression which isolates the friction force in the direct extrusion container:
pf pD2o
¼ mpc pDo L
4
where pf ¼ additional pressure required to overcome friction, MPa (lb/in2); pDo2=4 ¼
billet cross-sectional area, mm2 (in2); m ¼ coefficient of friction at the container wall; pc ¼
pressure of the billet against the container wall, MPa (lb/in2); and pDoL ¼ area of the
interface between billet and container wall, mm2 (in2). The right-hand side of this equation
indicates the billet-container friction force, and the left-hand side gives the additional ram
force to overcome that friction. In the worst case, sticking occurs at the container wall so
that friction stress equals shear yield strength of the work metal:
mps pDo L ¼ Y s pDo L
where Ys ¼ shear yield strength, MPa (lb/in2). If we assume that Y s ¼ Y f =2, then pf
reduces to the following:
pf ¼ Y f

2L
Do

Based on this reasoning, the following formula can be used to compute ram pressure in
direct extrusion:


2L
p ¼ Y f ex þ
ð19:23bÞ
Do
where the term 2L/Do accounts for the additional pressure due to friction at the container–
billet interface. L is the portion of the billet length remaining to be extruded, and Do is the
original diameter of the billet. Note that p is reduced as the remaining billet length decreases
during the process. Typical plots of ram pressure as a function of ram stroke for direct and
indirect extrusion are presented in Figure 19.34. Eq. (19.23b) probably overestimates ram
pressure. With good lubrication, ram pressures would be lower than values calculated by this
equation.
Ram force in indirect or direct extrusion is simply pressure p from Eqs. (19.23a) or
(19.23b), respectively, multiplied by billet area Ao:
F ¼ pAo

Example 19.3
Extrusion
Pressures

A billet 75 mm long and 25 mm in diameter is to be extruded in a direct extrusion operation
with extrusion ratio rx ¼ 4.0. The extrudate has a round cross section. The die angle (halfangle) ¼ 90 . The work metal has a strength coefficient ¼ 415 MPa, and strain-hardening
exponent ¼ 0.18. Use the Johnson formula with a ¼ 0.8 and b ¼ 1.5 to estimate extrusion
strain. Determine the pressure applied to the end of the billet as the ram moves forward.
Solution: Let us examine the ram pressure at billet lengths of L ¼ 75 mm (starting value),
L ¼ 50 mm, L ¼ 25 mm, and L ¼ 0. We compute the ideal true strain, extrusion strain using
Johnson’s formula, and average flow stress:
e ¼ ln rx ¼ ln 4:0 ¼ 1:3863
ex ¼ 0:8 þ 1:5(1:3863) ¼ 2:8795
Yf ¼

415(1:3863)0:18
¼ 373 MPa
1:18

L ¼ 75 mm: With a die angle of 90 , the billet metal is assumed to be forced through the die
opening almost immediately; thus, our calculation assumes that maximum pressure is
reached at the billet length of 75 mm. For die angles less than 90 , the pressure would build
to a maximum as in Figure 19.34 as the starting billet is squeezed into the cone-shaped
portion of the extrusion die. Using Eq. (19.23b),

L ¼ 0: Zero length is a hypothetical value in direct extrusion. In reality, it is impossible to
squeeze all of the metal through the die opening. Instead, a portion of the billet (the
‘‘butt’’) remains unextruded and the pressure begins to increase rapidly as L approaches
zero. This increase in pressure at the end of the stroke is seen in the plot of ram pressure
versus ram stroke in Figure 19.34. Calculated below is the hypothetical minimum value of
ram pressure that would result at L ¼ 0.

19.5.3 EXTRUSION DIES AND PRESSES
Important factors in an extrusion die are die angle and orifice shape. Die angle, more
precisely die half-angle, is shown as a in Figure 19.35(a). For low angles, surface area of the
die is large, leading to increased friction at the die–billet interface. Higher friction results in
larger ram force. On the other hand, a large die angle causes more turbulence in the metal
flow during reduction, increasing the ram force required. Thus, the effect of die angle on
ram force is a U-shaped function, as in Figure 19.35(b). An optimum die angle exists, as
suggested by our hypothetical plot. The optimum angle depends on various factors (e.g.,
work material, billet temperature, and lubrication) and is therefore difficult to determine
for a given extrusion job. Die designers rely on rules of thumb and judgment to decide the
appropriate angle.
Our previous equations for ram pressure, Eqs. (19.23a), apply to a circular die
orifice. The shape of the die orifice affects the ram pressure required to perform an
extrusion operation. A complex cross section, such as the one shown in Figure 19.36,
requires a higher pressure and greater force than a circular shape. The effect of the die
orifice shape can be assessed by the die shape factor, defined as the ratio of the pressure
required to extrude a cross section of a given shape relative to the extrusion pressure for a
round cross section of the same area. We can express the shape factor as follows:
 2:25
Cx
ð19:26Þ
Kx ¼ 0:98 þ 0:02
Cc
where Kx ¼ die shape factor in extrusion; Cx ¼ perimeter of the extruded cross section, mm
(in); and Cc ¼ perimeter of a circle of the same area as the extruded shape, mm (in). Eq.

(19.26) is based on empirical data in Altan et al. [1] over a range of Cx/Cc values from 1.0 to
about 6.0. The equation may be invalid much beyond the upper limit of this range.
As indicated by Eq. (19.26), the shape factor is a function of the perimeter of the
extruded cross section divided by the perimeter of a circular cross section of equal area. A
circular shape is the simplest shape, with a value of Kx ¼ 1.0. Hollow, thin-walled sections
have higher shape factors and are more difficult to extrude. The increase in pressure is not
included in our previous pressure equations, Eqs. (19.23a and 19.23b), which apply only
to round cross sections. For shapes other than round, the corresponding expression for
indirect extrusion is

and for direct extrusion,

p ¼ K x Y f ex



p ¼ K x Y f ex þ

ð19:27bÞ

where p ¼ extrusion pressure, MPa (lb/in2); Kx ¼ shape factor; and the other terms have
the same interpretation as before. Values of pressure given by these equations can be
used in Eq. (19.24) to determine ram force.
Die materials used for hot extrusion include tool and alloy steels. Important
properties of these die materials include high wear resistance, high hot hardness, and
high thermal conductivity to remove heat from the process. Die materials for cold
extrusion include tool steels and cemented carbides. Wear resistance and ability to retain
shape under high stress are desirable properties. Carbides are used when high production
rates, long die life, and good dimensional control are required.

Extrusion presses are either horizontal or vertical, depending on orientation of the
work axis. Horizontal types are more common. Extrusion presses are usually hydraulically
driven. This drive is especially suited to semi-continuous production of long sections, as in
direct extrusion. Mechanical drives are often used for cold extrusion of individual parts,
such as in impact extrusion.

19.5.4 OTHER EXTRUSION PROCESSES
Direct and indirect extrusion are the principal methods of extrusion. Various names are
given to operations that are special cases of the direct and indirect methods described here.
Other extrusion operations are unique. In this section we examine some of these special
forms of extrusion and related processes.
Impact Extrusion Impact extrusion is performed at higher speeds and shorter strokes
than conventional extrusion. It is used to make individual components. As the name
suggests, the punch impacts the workpart rather than simply applying pressure to it.
Impacting can be carried out as forward extrusion, backward extrusion, or combinations of these. Some representative examples are shown in Figure 19.37.

FIGURE 19.37 Several examples of impact extrusion: (a) forward, (b) backward, and (c) combination of forward
and backward.

Section 19.5/Extrusion

FIGURE 19.38
Hydrostatic extrusion.

Impact extrusion is usually done cold on a variety of metals. Backward impact
extrusion is most common. Products made by this process include toothpaste tubes and
battery cases. As indicated by these examples, very thin walls are possible on impact
extruded parts. The high-speed characteristics of impacting permit large reductions and
high production rates, making this an important commercial process.
Hydrostatic Extrusion One of the problems in direct extrusion is friction along the billet–
container interface. This problem can be addressed by surrounding the billet with fluid inside
the container and pressurizing the fluid by the forward motion of the ram, as in Figure 19.38.
This way, there is no friction inside the container, and friction at the die opening is reduced.
Consequently, ram force is significantly lower than in direct extrusion. The fluid pressure
acting on all surfaces of the billet gives the process its name. It can be carried out at room
temperature or at elevated temperatures. Special fluids and procedures must be used at
elevated temperatures. Hydrostatic extrusion is an adaptation of direct extrusion.
Hydrostatic pressure on the work increases the material’s ductility. Accordingly, this
process can be used on metals that would be too brittle for conventional extrusion operations.
Ductile metals can also be hydrostatically extruded, and high reduction ratios are possible on
these materials. One of the disadvantages of the process is the required preparation of the
starting work billet. The billet must be formed with a taper at one end to fit snugly into the die
entry angle. This establishes a seal to prevent fluid from squirting out the die hole when the
container is initially pressurized.

19.5.5 DEFECTS IN EXTRUDED PRODUCTS
Owing to the considerable deformation associated with extrusion operations, a number
of defects can occur in extruded products. The defects can be classified into the following
categories, illustrated in Figure 19.39:

FIGURE 19.39 Some common
defects in extrusion: (a) centerburst,
(b) piping, and (c) surface cracking.

Chapter 19/Bulk Deformation Processes in Metal Working

(a) Centerburst. This defect is an internal crack that develops as a result of tensile stresses
along the centerline of the workpart during extrusion. Although tensile stresses may
seem unlikely in a compression process such as extrusion, they tend to occur under
conditions that cause large deformation in the regions of the work away from the central
axis. The significant material movement in these outer regions stretches the material
along the center of the work. If stresses are great enough, bursting occurs. Conditions
that promote centerburst are high die angles, low extrusion ratios, and impurities in the
work metal that serve as starting points for crack defects. The difficult aspect of
centerburst is its detection. It is an internal defect that is usually not noticeable by
visual observation. Other names sometimes used for this defect include arrowhead
fracture, center cracking, and chevron cracking.
(b) Piping. Piping is a defect associated with direct extrusion. As in Figure 19.39(b), it is
the formation of a sink hole in the end of the billet. The use of a dummy block whose
diameter is slightly less than that of the billet helps to avoid piping. Other names given
to this defect include tailpipe and fishtailing.
(c) Surface cracking. This defect results from high workpart temperatures that cause cracks
to develop at the surface. They often occur when extrusion speed is too high, leading to
high strain rates and associated heat generation. Other factors contributing to surface
cracking are high friction and surface chilling of high temperature billets in hot extrusion.

19.6 WIRE AND BAR DRAWING
In the context of bulk deformation, drawing is an operation in which the cross section of a
bar, rod, or wire is reduced by pulling it through a die opening, as in Figure 19.40. The
general features of the process are similar to those of extrusion. The difference is that the
work is pulled through the die in drawing, whereas it is pushed through the die in
extrusion. Although the presence of tensile stresses is obvious in drawing, compression
also plays a significant role because the metal is squeezed down as it passes through the
die opening. For this reason, the deformation that occurs in drawing is sometimes
referred to as indirect compression. Drawing is a term also used in sheet metalworking
(Section 20.3). The term wire and bar drawing is used to distinguish the drawing process
discussed here from the sheet metal process of the same name.
The basic difference between bar drawing and wire drawing is the stock size that is
processed. Bar drawing is the term used for large diameter bar and rod stock, while wire
drawing applies to small diameter stock. Wire sizes down to 0.03 mm (0.001 in) are
possible in wire drawing. Although the mechanics of the process are the same for the two
cases, the methods, equipment, and even the terminology are somewhat different.
Bar drawing is generally accomplished as a single-draft operation—the stock is
pulled through one die opening. Because the beginning stock has a large diameter, it is in

the form of a straight cylindrical piece rather than coiled. This limits the length of the
work that can be drawn, necessitating a batch type operation. By contrast, wire is drawn
from coils consisting of several hundred (or even several thousand) feet of wire and is
passed through a series of draw dies. The number of dies varies typically between 4 and
12. The term continuous drawing is used to describe this type of operation because of the
long production runs that are achieved with the wire coils, which can be butt-welded each
to the next to make the operation truly continuous.
In a drawing operation, the change in size of the work is usually given by the area
reduction, defined as follows:
r¼

Ao  Af
Ao

ð19:28Þ

where r ¼ area reduction in drawing; Ao ¼ original area of work, mm2 (in2); and Af ¼ final
area, mm2 (in2). Area reduction is often expressed as a percentage.
In bar drawing, rod drawing, and in drawing of large diameter wire for upsetting
and heading operations, the term draft is used to denote the before and after difference in
size of the processed work. The draft is simply the difference between original and final
stock diameters:
d ¼ D o  Df

ð19:29Þ

where d ¼ draft, mm (in); Do ¼ original diameter of work, mm (in); and Df ¼ final work
diameter, mm (in).

19.6.1 ANALYSIS OF DRAWING
In this section, we consider the mechanics of wire and bar drawing. How are stresses and
forces computed in the process? We also consider how large a reduction is possible in a
drawing operation.
Mechanics of Drawing If no friction or redundant work occurred in drawing, true
strain could be determined as follows:
Ao

where Ao and Af are the original and final cross-sectional areas of the work, as previously

this ideal deformation is given by

where Y f ¼ 1þn
¼ average flow stress based on the value of strain given by Eq. (19.30).
Because friction is present in drawing and the work metal experiences inhomogeneous deformation, the actual stress is larger than provided by Eq. (19.31). In
addition to the ratio Ao/Af, other variables that influence draw stress are die angle and
coefficient of friction at the work–die interface. A number of methods have been proposed
for predicting draw stress based on values of these parameters [1], [3], and [19]. We present
the equation suggested by Schey [19]:

f ¼ 0:88  0:12

D
Lc

ð19:33Þ

where D ¼ average diameter of work during drawing, mm (in); and Lc ¼ contact length of
the work with the draw die in Figure 19.40, mm (in). Values of D and Lc can be determined
from the following:
D¼

Do þ Df

ð19:34aÞ

Lc ¼

ð19:35Þ

where F ¼ draw force, N (lb); and the other terms are defined above. The power required
in a drawing operation is the draw force multiplied by exit velocity of the work.

Example 19.4
Stress and Force
in Wire Drawing

Wire is drawn through a draw die with entrance angle ¼ 15 . Starting diameter is 2.5 mm and
final diameter ¼ 2.0 mm. The coefficient of friction at the work–die interface ¼ 0.07. The
metal has a strength coefficient K ¼ 205 MPa and a strain-hardening exponent n ¼ 0.20.
Determine the draw stress and draw force in this operation.
Solution: The values of D and Lc for Eq. (19.33) can be determined using Eqs. (19.34). D ¼
2.25 mm and Lc ¼ 0.966 mm. Thus,
2:25
f ¼ 0:88 þ 0:12
¼ 1:16
0:966
The areas before and after drawing are computed as Ao ¼ 4.91 mm2 and Af ¼ 3.14 mm2. The
resulting true strain e ¼ ln(4.91/3.14) ¼ 0.446, and the average flow stress in the operation is
computed:
Yf ¼

wire:
F ¼ 94:1(3:14) ¼ 295:5 N

Maximum Reduction per Pass A question that may occur to the reader is: Why is more
than one step required to achieve the desired reduction in wire drawing? Why not take the
entire reduction in a single pass through one die, as in extrusion? The answer can be
explained as follows. From the preceding equations, it is clear that as the reduction increases,
draw stress increases. If the reduction is large enough, draw stress will exceed the yield

16:35:40

Page 433

Section 19.6/Wire and Bar Drawing

433

strength of the exiting metal. When that happens, the drawn wire will simply elongate
instead of new material being squeezed through the die opening. For wire drawing to be
successful, maximum draw stress must be less than the yield strength of the exiting metal.
It is a straightforward matter to determine this maximum draw stress and the resulting
maximum possible reduction that can be made in one pass, under certain assumptions. Let us
assume a perfectly plastic metal (n ¼ 0), no friction, and no redundant work. In this ideal case,
the maximum possible draw stress is equal to the yield strength of the work material.
Expressing this using the equation for draw stress under conditions of ideal deformation, Eq.
(19.31), and setting Y f ¼ Y (because n ¼ 0),
s d ¼ Y f ln

Ao

This means that ln(Ao=Af) ¼ ln (1=(1  r)) ¼ 1. That is, emax ¼ 1.0. In order for emax to be
zero, then Ao=Af ¼ 1=(1  r) must equal the natural logarithm base e. Accordingly, the
maximum possible area ratio is
Ao
¼ e ¼ 2:7183

ð19:36Þ

and the maximum possible reduction is
rmax ¼

ð19:37Þ

The value given by Eq. (19.37) is often used as the theoretical maximum reduction possible in
a single draw, even though it ignores (1) the effects of friction and redundant work, which
would reduce the maximum possible value, and (2) strain hardening, which would increase
the maximum possible reduction because the exiting wire would be stronger than the starting
metal. In practice, draw reductions per pass are quite below the theoretical limit. Reductions
of 0.50 for single-draft bar drawing and 0.30 for multiple-draft wire drawing seem to be the
upper limits in industrial operations.

19.6.2 DRAWING PRACTICE
Drawing is usually performed as a cold working operation. It is most frequently used to
produce round cross sections, but squares and other shapes are also drawn. Wire drawing
is an important industrial process, providing commercial products such as electrical wire
and cable; wire stock for fences, coat hangers, and shopping carts; and rod stock to
produce nails, screws, rivets, springs, and other hardware items. Bar drawing is used to
produce metal bars for machining, forging, and other processes.
Advantages of drawing in these applications include (1) close dimensional control,
(2) good surface finish, (3) improved mechanical properties such as strength and hardness,
and (4) adaptability to economical batch or mass production. Drawing speeds are as high as
50 m/s (10,000 ft/min) for very fine wire. In the case of bar drawing to provide stock for
machining, the operation improves the machinability of the bar (Section 24.1).
Drawing Equipment Bar drawing is accomplished on a machine called a draw bench,
consisting of an entry table, die stand (which contains the draw die), carriage, and exit rack.
The arrangement is shown in Figure 19.41. The carriage is used to pull the stock through the
draw die. It is powered by hydraulic cylinders or motor-driven chains. The die stand is often
designed to hold more than one die, so that several bars can be pulled simultaneously
through their respective dies.

Hydraulically operated

Wire drawing is done on continuous drawing machines that consist of multiple draw
dies, separated by accumulating drums between the dies, as in Figure 19.42. Each drum,
called a capstan, is motor driven to provide the proper pull force to draw the wire stock
through the upstream die. It also maintains a modest tension on the wire as it proceeds to
the next draw die in the series. Each die provides a certain amount of reduction in the wire,
so that the desired total reduction is achieved by the series. Depending on the metal to be
processed and the total reduction, annealing of the wire is sometimes required between
groups of dies in the series.
Draw Dies Figure 19.43 identifies the features of a typical draw die. Four regions of the die
can be distinguished: (1) entry, (2) approach angle, (3) bearing surface (land), and (4) back
relief. The entry region is usually a bell-shaped mouth that does not contact the work. Its
purpose is to funnel the lubricant into the die and prevent scoring of work and die surfaces.
The approach is where the drawing process occurs. It is cone-shaped with an angle (halfangle) normally ranging from about 6 to 20 . The proper angle varies according to work

material. The bearing surface, or land, determines the size of the final drawn stock. Finally,
the back relief is the exit zone. It is provided with a back relief angle (half-angle) of about
30 . Draw dies are made of tool steels or cemented carbides. Dies for high-speed wire
drawing operations frequently use inserts made of diamond (both synthetic and natural) for
the wear surfaces.
Preparation of the Work Prior to drawing, the beginning stock must be properly
prepared. This involves three steps: (1) annealing, (2) cleaning, and (3) pointing. The
purpose of annealing is to increase the ductility of the stock to accept deformation during
drawing. As previously mentioned, annealing is sometimes needed between steps in
continuous drawing. Cleaning of the stock is required to prevent damage of the work
surface and draw die. It involves removal of surface contaminants (e.g., scale and rust) by
means of chemical pickling or shot blasting. In some cases, prelubrication of the work
surface is accomplished subsequent to cleaning.
Pointing involves the reduction in diameter of the starting end of the stock so that it
can be inserted through the draw die to start the process. This is usually accomplished by
swaging, rolling, or turning. The pointed end of the stock is then gripped by the carriage
jaws or other device to initiate the drawing process.

19.6.3 TUBE DRAWING
Drawing can be used to reduce the diameter or wall thickness of seamless tubes and pipes,
after the initial tubing has been produced by some other process such as extrusion. Tube
drawing can be carried out either with or without a mandrel. The simplest method uses no
mandrel and is used for diameter reduction, as in Figure 19.44. The term tube sinking is
sometimes applied to this operation.

FIGURE 19.45

Tube drawing with mandrels: (a) fixed mandrel, (b) floating plug.

The problem with tube drawing in which no mandrel is used, as in Figure 19.44, is that
it lacks control over the inside diameter and wall thickness of the tube. This is why mandrels
of various types are used, two of which are illustrated in Figure 19.45. The first, Figure 19.45
(a), uses a fixed mandrel attached to a long support bar to establish inside diameter and wall
thickness during the operation. Practical limitations on the length of the support bar in this
method restrict the length of the tube that can be drawn. The second type, shown in (b), uses
a floating plug whose shape is designed so that it finds a ‘‘natural’’ position in the reduction
zone of the die. This method removes the limitations on work length present with the fixed
mandrel.

operation. As the thickness is reduced, the plate
widens by 4%. The yield strength of the steel plate
is 174 MPa and the tensile strength is 290 MPa. The
entrance speed of the plate is 15.0 m/min. The roll
radius is 325 mm and the rotational speed is 49.0

coefficient of friction that would make this rolling
operation possible, (b) exit velocity of the plate,
and (c) forward slip.
19.2. A 2.0-in-thick slab is 10.0 in wide and 12.0 ft long.
Thickness is to be reduced in three steps in a hot

75% of its previous thickness. It is expected that for
this metal and reduction, the slab will widen by 3%
in each step. If the entry speed of the slab in the first
step is 40 ft/min, and roll speed is the same for the
three steps, determine: (a) length and (b) exit
velocity of the slab after the final reduction.

Sheet metalworking includes cutting and forming operations performed on relatively thin sheets of metal. Typical
sheet-metal thicknesses are between 0.4 mm (1/64 in) and 6
mm (1/4 in). When thickness exceeds about 6 mm, the stock
is usually referred to as plate rather than sheet. The sheet or
plate stock used in sheet metalworking is produced by flat
rolling (Section 19.1). The most commonly used sheet
metal is low carbon steel (0.06%–0.15% C typical). Its
low cost and good formability, combined with sufficient
strength for most product applications, make it ideal as a
starting material.
The commercial importance of sheet metalworking is
significant. Consider the number of consumer and industrial
products that include sheet or plate metal parts: automobile
and truck bodies, airplanes, railway cars, locomotives, farm
and construction equipment, appliances, office furniture,
and more. Although these examples are conspicuous because they have sheet-metal exteriors, many of their internal
components are also made of sheet or plate stock. Sheetmetal parts are generally characterized by high strength,
good dimensional accuracy, good surface finish, and relatively low cost. For components that must be made in large
quantities, economical mass-production operations can be
designed to process the parts. Aluminum beverage cans are a
prime example.
Sheet-metal processing is usually performed at room
temperature (cold working). The exceptions are when the
stock is thick, the metal is brittle, or the deformation is
significant. These are usually cases of warm working rather
than hot working.
Most sheet-metal operations are performed on machine tools called presses. The term stamping press is used
to distinguish these presses from forging and extrusion
presses. The tooling that performs sheet metalwork is
called a punch-and-die; the term stamping die is also
used. The sheet-metal products are called stampings. To
facilitate mass production, the sheet metal is often presented to the press as long strips or coils. Various types of

punch-and-die tooling and stamping presses are described in Section 20.5. Final sections
of the chapter cover various operations that do not utilize conventional punch-and-die
tooling, and most of them are not performed on stamping presses. Two video clips on our
DVD illustrate many of the topics discussed in this chapter.

Sheet-Metal Stamping Dies and Processes. Two segments are included: (1) sheet metal
formability and (2) basic stamping die operations.

The three major categories of sheet-metal processes are (1) cutting,
(2)
bending, and (3) drawing. Cutting is used to separate large sheets into smaller pieces, to
cut out part perimeters, and to make holes in parts. Bending and drawing are used to form
sheet-metal parts into their required shapes.

20.1 CUTTING OPERATIONS
Cutting of sheet metal is accomplished by a shearing action between two sharp cutting
edges. The shearing action is depicted in the four stop-action sketches of Figure 20.1, in
which the upper cutting edge (the punch) sweeps down past a stationary lower cutting edge
(the die). As the punch begins to push into the work, plastic deformation occurs in the
surfaces of the sheet. As the punch moves downward, penetration occurs in which the
punch compresses the sheet and cuts into the metal. This penetration zone is generally
about one-third the thickness of the sheet. As the punch continues to travel into the work,
fracture is initiated in the work at the two cutting edges. If the clearance between the punch

and die is correct, the two fracture lines meet, resulting in a clean separation of the work
into two pieces.
The sheared edges of the sheet have characteristic features as in Figure 20.2. At the
top of the cut surface is a region called the rollover. This corresponds to the depression
made by the punch in the work prior to cutting. It is where initial plastic deformation
occurred in the work. Just below the rollover is a relatively smooth region called the
burnish. This results from penetration of the punch into the work before fracture began.
Beneath the burnish is the fractured zone, a relatively rough surface of the cut edge where
continued downward movement of the punch caused fracture of the metal. Finally, at the
bottom of the edge is a burr, a sharp corner on the edge caused by elongation of the metal
during final separation of the two pieces.

20.1.1 SHEARING, BLANKING, AND PUNCHING
The three most important operations in pressworking that cut metal by the shearing
mechanism just described are shearing, blanking, and punching.
Shearing is a sheet-metal cutting operation along a straight line between two
cutting edges, as shown in Figure 20.3(a). Shearing is typically used to cut large sheets
into smaller sections for subsequent pressworking operations. It is performed on a
machine called a power shears, or squaring shears. The upper blade of the power
shears is often inclined, as shown in Figure 20.3(b), to reduce the required cutting force.
Blanking involves cutting of the sheet metal along a closed outline in a single
step to separate the piece from the surrounding stock, as in Figure 20.4(a). The part
that is cut out is the desired product in the operation and is called the blank. Punching
is similar to blanking except that it produces a hole, and the separated piece is scrap,
called the slug. The remaining stock is the desired part. The distinction is illustrated in
Figure 20.4(b).

20.1.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF SHEET-METAL CUTTING
Process parameters in sheet-metal cutting are clearance between punch and die, stock
thickness, type of metal and its strength, and length of the cut. Let us define these
parameters and some of the relationships among them.
Clearance The clearance c in a shearing operation is the distance between the punch
and die, as shown in Figure 20.1(a). Typical clearances in conventional pressworking
range between 4% and 8% of the sheet-metal thickness t. The effect of improper
clearances is illustrated in Figure 20.5. If the clearance is too small, then the fracture
lines tend to pass each other, causing a double burnishing and larger cutting forces. If the
clearance is too large, the metal becomes pinched between the cutting edges and an
excessive burr results. In special operations requiring very straight edges, such as shaving
and fine blanking (Section 20.1.3), clearance is only about 1% of stock thickness.
The correct clearance depends on sheet-metal type and thickness. The recommended clearance can be calculated by the following formula:
c ¼ Ac t

ð20:1Þ

where c ¼ clearance, mm (in); Ac ¼ clearance allowance; and t ¼ stock thickness, mm (in).
The clearance allowance is determined according to type of metal. For convenience,
metals are classified into three groups given in Table 20.1, with an associated allowance
value for each group.

These calculated clearance values can be applied to conventional blanking and holepunching operations to determine the proper punch and die sizes. The die opening must
always be larger than the punch size (obviously). Whether to add the clearance value to the
die size or subtract it from the punch size depends on whether the part being cut out is a
blank or a slug, as illustrated in Figure 20.6 for a circular part. Because of the geometry of
the sheared edge, the outer dimension of the part cut out of the sheet will be larger than the
hole size. Thus, punch and die sizes for a round blank of diameter Db are determined as
Blanking punch diameter ¼ Db  2c

ð20:2aÞ

Blanking die diameter ¼ Db

ð20:2bÞ

Punch and die sizes for a round hole of diameter Dh are determined as:
Hole punch diameter ¼ Dh

ð20:3aÞ

Hole die diameter ¼ Dh þ 2c

ð20:3bÞ

In order for the slug or blank to drop through the die, the die opening must have an
angular clearance (see Figure 20.7) of 0.25 to 1.5 on each side.
Cutting Forces Estimates of cutting force are important because this force determines
the size (tonnage) of the press needed. Cutting force F in sheet metalworking can be
determined by
F ¼ StL
ð20:4Þ
where S ¼ shear strength of the sheet metal, MPa (lb/in2); t ¼ stock thickness, mm (in),
and L ¼ length of the cut edge, mm (in). In blanking, punching, slotting, and similar
operations, L is the perimeter length of the blank or hole being cut. The minor effect of
clearance in determining the value of L can be neglected. If shear strength is unknown, an

alternative way of estimating the cutting force is to use the tensile strength:
F ¼ 0:7ðTSÞtL

ð20:5Þ

where TS ¼ ultimate tensile strength MPa (lb/in2).
These equations for estimating cutting force assume that the entire cut along the
sheared edge length L is made at the same time. In this case the cutting force will be a
maximum. It is possible to reduce the maximum force by using an angled cutting edge on
the punch or die, as in Figure 20.3(b). The angle (called the shear angle), spreads the cut
over time and reduces the force experienced at any one moment. However, the total energy
required in the operation is the same, whether it is concentrated into a brief moment or
distributed over a longer time period.

A round disk of 150-mm diameter is to be blanked from a strip of 3.2-mm, half-hard coldrolled steel whose shear strength ¼ 310 MPa. Determine (a) the appropriate punch and
die diameters, and (b) blanking force.
Solution: (a) From Table 20.1, the clearance allowance for half-hard cold-rolled steel is
Ac ¼ 0.075. Accordingly,
c ¼ 0:075ð3:2 mmÞ ¼ 0:24 mm
The blank is to have a diameter ¼ 150 mm, and die size determines blank size.
Therefore,
Die opening diameter ¼ 150:00 mm
Punch diameter ¼ 150  2ð0:24Þ ¼ 149:52 mm
(b) To determine the blanking force, we assume that the entire perimeter of the part is
blanked at one time. The length of the cut edge is

20.1.3 OTHER SHEET-METAL-CUTTING OPERATIONS
In addition to shearing, blanking, and punching, there are several other cutting operations in pressworking. The cutting mechanism in each case involves the same shearing
action discussed above.

FIGURE 20.8 (a) Cutoff
and (b) parting.

Cutoff and Parting Cutoff is a shearing operation in which blanks are separated
from a sheet-metal strip by cutting the opposite sides of the part in sequence, as shown in
Figure 20.8(a). With each cut, a new part is produced. The features of a cutoff operation
that distinguish it from a conventional shearing operation are (1) the cut edges are not
necessarily straight, and (2) the blanks can be nested on the strip in such a way that scrap
is avoided.
Parting involves cutting a sheet-metal strip by a punch with two cutting edges that
match the opposite sides of the blank, as shown in Figure 20.8(b). This might be required
because the part outline has an irregular shape that precludes perfect nesting of the
blanks on the strip. Parting is less efficient than cutoff in the sense that it results in some
wasted material.
Slotting, Perforating, and Notching Slotting is the term sometimes used for a punching
operation that cuts out an elongated or rectangular hole, as pictured in Figure 20.9(a).
Perforating involves the simultaneous punching of a pattern of holes in sheet metal, as in
Figure 20.9(b). The hole pattern is usually for decorative purposes, or to allow passage of
light, gas, or fluid.
To obtain the desired outline of a blank, portions of the sheet metal are often
removed by notching and seminotching. Notching involves cutting out a portion of metal
from the side of the sheet or strip. Seminotching removes a portion of metal from the
interior of the sheet. These operations are depicted in Figure 20.9(c). Seminotching might
seem to the reader to be the same as a punching or slotting operation. The difference is

that the metal removed by seminotching creates part of the blank outline, while punching
and slotting create holes in the blank.
Trimming, Shaving, and Fine Blanking Trimming is a cutting operation performed on a
formed part to remove excess metal and establish size. The term has the same basic
meaning here as in forging (Section 19.4). A typical example in sheet metalwork is
trimming the upper portion of a deep drawn cup to leave the desired dimensions on
the cup.
Shaving is a shearing operation performed with very small clearance to obtain
accurate dimensions and cut edges that are smooth and straight, as pictured in
Figure 20.10(a). Shaving is typically performed as a secondary or finishing operation
on parts that have been previously cut.
Fine blanking is a shearing operation used to blank sheet-metal parts with close
tolerances and smooth, straight edges in one step, as illustrated in Figure 20.10(b). At the
start of the cycle, a pressure pad with a V-shaped projection applies a holding force Fh
against the work adjacent to the punch in order to compress the metal and prevent
distortion. The punch then descends with a slower-than-normal velocity and smaller
clearances to provide the desired dimensions and cut edges. The process is usually reserved
for relatively small stock thicknesses.

20.2 BENDING OPERATIONS
Bending in sheet-metal work is defined as the straining of the metal around a straight axis, as
in Figure 20.11. During the bending operation, the metal on the inside of the neutral plane is
compressed, while the metal on the outside of the neutral plane is stretched. These strain
conditions can be seen in Figure 20.11(b). The metal is plastically deformed so that the bend
takes a permanent set upon removal of the stresses that caused it. Bending produces little or
no change in the thickness of the sheet metal.

20.2.1 V-BENDING AND EDGE BENDING
Bending operations are performed using punch and die tooling. The two common
bending methods and associated tooling are V-bending, performed with a V-die; and
edge bending, performed with a wiping die. These methods are illustrated in Figure 20.12.

In V-bending, the sheet metal is bent between a V-shaped punch and die. Included
angles ranging from very obtuse to very acute can be made with V-dies. V-bending is
generally used for low-production operations. It is often performed on a press brake (Section
20.5.2), and the associated V-dies are relatively simple and inexpensive.
Edge bending involves cantilever loading of the sheet metal. A pressure pad is used
to apply a force Fh to hold the base of the part against the die, while the punch forces the
part to yield and bend over the edge of the die. In the setup shown in Figure 20.12(b),
edge bending is limited to bends of 90 or less. More complicated wiping dies can be
designed for bend angles greater than 90 . Because of the pressure pad, wiping dies are
more complicated and costly than V-dies and are generally used for high-production
work.

20.2.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF BENDING
Some of the important terms in sheet-metal bending are identified in Figure 20.11. The
metal of thickness t is bent through an angle called the bend angle a. This results in a
sheet-metal part with an included angle a0, where a + a0 ¼ 180 . The bend radius R is
normally specified on the inside of the part, rather than at the neutral axis, and
is determined by the radius on the tooling used to perform the operation. The bend
is made over the width of the workpiece w.
Bend Allowance If the bend radius is small relative to stock thickness, the metal tends
to stretch during bending. It is important to be able to estimate the amount of stretching

that occurs, if any, so that the final part length will match the specified dimension. The
problem is to determine the length of the neutral axis before bending to account for
stretching of the final bent section. This length is called the bend allowance, and it can be
estimated as follows:
Ab ¼ 2p

a
ðR þ K ba tÞ
360

ð20:6Þ

where Ab ¼ bend allowance, mm (in); a ¼ bend angle, degrees; R ¼ bend radius, mm (in);
t ¼ stock thickness, mm (in); and Kba is factor to estimate stretching. The following design
values are recommended for Kba [3]: if <2t, Kba ¼ 0.33; and if R  2t, Kba ¼ 0.50. The
values of Kba predict that stretching occurs only if bend radius is small relative to sheet
thickness.
Springback When the bending pressure is removed at the end of the deformation
operation, elastic energy remains in the bent part, causing it to recover partially toward its
original shape. This elastic recovery is called springback, defined as the increase in included
angle of the bent part relative to the included angle of the forming tool after the tool is
removed. This is illustrated in Figure 20.13 and is expressed:
SB ¼

a0  a0 t
a0 t

ð20:7Þ

where SB ¼ springback; a0 ¼ included angle of the sheet-metal part, degrees; and a0 t ¼
included angle of the bending tool, degrees. Although not as obvious, an increase in the
bend radius also occurs due to elastic recovery. The amount of springback increases with
modulus of elasticity E and yield strength Y of the work metal.
Compensation for springback can be accomplished by several methods. Two
common methods are overbending and bottoming. In overbending, the punch angle
and radius are fabricated slightly smaller than the specified angle on the final part so
that the sheet metal springs back to the desired value. Bottoming involves squeezing
the part at the end of the stroke, thus plastically deforming it in the bend region.
Bending Force The force required to perform bending depends on the geometry of the
punch-and-die and the strength, thickness, and length of the sheet metal. The maximum

FIGURE 20.13
Springback in bending shows itself as a decrease in bend angle and an
increase in bend radius: (1) during the operation, the work is forced to take the radius
Rt and included angle a0 t ¼ determined by the bending tool (punch in V-bending); (2) after
the punch is removed, the work springs back to radius R and included angle a0 . Symbol:

bending force can be estimated by means of the following equation:

ð20:8Þ

where F ¼ bending force, N (lb); TS ¼ tensile strength of the sheet metal, MPa (lb/in2); w ¼
width of part in the direction of the bend axis, mm (in); t ¼ stock thickness, mm (in); and
D ¼ die opening dimension as defined in Figure 20.14, mm (in). Eq. (20.8) is based on
bending of a simple beam in mechanics, and Kbf is a constant that accounts for differences
encountered in an actual bending process. Its value depends on type of bending: for
V-bending, Kbf ¼ 1.33; and for edge bending, Kbf ¼ 0.33.

Example 20.2
Sheet-Metal
Bending

A sheet-metal blank is to be bent as shown in Figure 20.15. The metal has a modulus of
elasticity ¼ 205 (103) MPa, yield strength ¼ 275 MPa, and tensile strength ¼ 450 MPa.
Determine (a) the starting blank size and (b) the bending force if a V-die is used with a die
opening dimension ¼ 25 mm.
Solution: (a) The starting blank ¼ 44.5 mm wide. Its length ¼ 38 þ Ab þ 25 (mm). For the
included angle a0 ¼ 120 , the bend angle a ¼ 60 . The value of Kba in Eq. (20.6) ¼ 0.33 since
R=t ¼ 4.75=3.2 ¼ 1.48 (less than 2.0).
Ab ¼ 2p

20.2.3 OTHER BENDING AND FORMING OPERATIONS

Flanging, Hemming, Seaming, and Curling Flanging is a bending operation in which
the edge of a sheet-metal part is bent at a 90 angle (usually) to form a rim or flange. It is
often used to strengthen or stiffen sheet metal. The flange can be formed over a straight
bend axis, as illustrated in Figure 20.16(a), or it can involve some stretching or shrinking
of the metal, as in (b) and (c).
Hemming involves bending the edge of the sheet over on itself, in more than one
bending step. This is often done to eliminate the sharp edge on the piece, to increase stiffness,
and to improve appearance. Seaming is a related operation in which two sheet-metal edges
are assembled. Hemming and seaming are illustrated in Figure 20.17(a) and (b).
Curling, also called beading, forms the edges of the part into a roll or curl, as in Figure
20.17(c). As in hemming, it is done for purposes of safety, strength, and aesthetics. Examples
of products in which curling is used include hinges, pots and pans, and pocket-watch cases.
These examples show that curling can be performed over straight or curved bend axes.
Miscellaneous Bending Operations Various other bending operations are depicted in
Figure 20.18 to illustrate the variety of shapes that can be bent. Most of these operations
are performed in relatively simple dies similar to V-dies.

20.3 DRAWING
Drawing is a sheet-metal-forming operation used to make cup-shaped, box-shaped, or
other complex-curved and concave parts. It is performed by placing a piece of sheet metal
over a die cavity and then pushing the metal into the opening with a punch, as in Figure
20.19. The blank must usually be held down flat against the die by a blankholder.
Common parts made by drawing include beverage cans, ammunition shells, sinks,
cooking pots, and automobile body panels.

20.3.1 MECHANICS OF DRAWING
Drawing of a cup-shaped part is the basic drawing operation, with dimensions and
parameters as pictured in Figure 20.19. A blank of diameter Db is drawn into a die cavity
by means of a punch with diameter Dp. The punch and die must have corner radii, given by

Rp and Rd. If the punch and die were to have sharp corners (Rp and Rd ¼ 0), a hole-punching
operation (and not a very good one) would be accomplished rather than a drawing
operation. The sides of the punch and die are separated by a clearance c. This clearance
in drawing is about 10% greater than the stock thickness:
c ¼ 1:1 t

ð20:9Þ

The punch applies a downward force F to accomplish the deformation of the metal, and a
downward holding force Fh is applied by the blankholder, as shown in the sketch.
As the punch proceeds downward toward its final bottom position, the work
experiences a complex sequence of stresses and strains as it is gradually formed into the
shape defined by the punch and die cavity. The stages in the deformation process are
illustrated in Figure 20.20. As the punch first begins to push into the work, the metal is
subjected to a bending operation. The sheet is simply bent over the corner of the punch
and the corner of the die, as in Figure 20.20(2). The outside perimeter of the blank moves
in toward the center in this first stage, but only slightly.
As the punch moves further down, a straightening action occurs in the metal that
was previously bent over the die radius, as in Figure 20.20(3). The metal at the bottom of
the cup, as well as along the punch radius, has been moved downward with the punch, but
the metal that was bent over the die radius must now be straightened in order to be pulled
into the clearance to form the wall of the cylinder. At the same time, more metal must be
added to replace that being used in the cylinder wall. This new metal comes from the

outside edge of the blank. The metal in the outer portions of the blank is pulled or drawn
toward the die opening to resupply the previously bent and straightened metal now
forming the cylinder wall. This type of metal flow through a constricted space gives the
drawing process its name.
During this stage of the process, friction and compression play important roles in
the flange of the blank. In order for the material in the flange to move toward the die
opening, friction between the sheet metal and the surfaces of the blankholder and the die
must be overcome. Initially, static friction is involved until the metal starts to slide; then,
after metal flow begins, dynamic friction governs the process. The magnitude of the
holding force applied by the blankholder, as well as the friction conditions at the two
interfaces, are determining factors in the success of this aspect of the drawing operation.
Lubricants or drawing compounds are generally used to reduce friction forces. In
addition to friction, compression is also occurring in the outer edge of the blank. As
the metal in this portion of the blank is drawn toward the center, the outer perimeter
becomes smaller. Because the volume of metal remains constant, the metal is squeezed
and becomes thicker as the perimeter is reduced. This often results in wrinkling of the
remaining flange of the blank, especially when thin sheet metal is drawn, or when the
blankholder force is too low. It is a condition which cannot be corrected once it has
occurred. The friction and compression effects are illustrated in Figure 20.20(4).
The holding force applied by the blankholder is now seen to be a critical factor in
deep drawing. If it is too small, wrinkling occurs. If it is too large, it prevents the metal
from flowing properly toward the die cavity, resulting in stretching and possible tearing of
the sheet metal. Determining the proper holding force involves a delicate balance
between these opposing factors.
Progressive downward motion of the punch results in a continuation of the metal
flow caused by drawing and compression. In addition, some thinning of the cylinder wall
occurs, as in Figure 20.20(5). The force being applied by the punch is opposed by the
metal in the form of deformation and friction in the operation. A portion of the
deformation involves stretching and thinning of the metal as it is pulled over the
edge of the die opening. Up to 25% thinning of the side wall may occur in a successful
drawing operation, mostly near the base of the cup.

20.3.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF DRAWING
It is important to assess the limitations on the amount of drawing that can be accomplished. This is often guided by simple measures that can be readily calculated for a given
operation. In addition, drawing force and holding force are important process variables.
Finally, the starting blank size must be determined.
Measures of Drawing One of the measures of the severity of a deep drawing operation
is the drawing ratio DR. This is most easily defined for a cylindrical shape as the ratio of
blank diameter Db to punch diameter Dp. In equation form,
DR ¼

Db
Dp

ð20:10Þ

The drawing ratio provides an indication, albeit a crude one, of the severity of a given
drawing operation. The greater the ratio, the more severe the operation. An approximate
upper limit on the drawing ratio is a value of 2.0. The actual limiting value for a given
operation depends on punch and die corner radii (Rp and Rd), friction conditions, depth
of draw, and characteristics of the sheet metal (e.g., ductility, degree of directionality of
strength properties in the metal).

E1C20

11/11/2009

458

16:3:57

Page 458

Chapter 20/Sheet Metalworking

Another way to characterize a given drawing operation is by the reduction r, where
r¼

Db  Dp
Db

ð20:11Þ

It is very closely related to drawing ratio. Consistent with the previous limit on DR
(DR  2.0), the value of reduction r should be less than 0.50.
A third measure in deep drawing is the thickness-to-diameter ratio t/Db (thickness
of the starting blank t divided by the blank diameter Db). Often expressed as a
percentage, it is desirable for the t/Db ratio to be greater than 1%. As t/Db decreases,
tendency for wrinkling (Section 20.3.4) increases.
In cases where these limits on drawing ratio, reduction, and t/Db ratio are exceeded
by the design of the drawn part, the blank must be drawn in two or more steps, sometimes
with annealing between the steps.

Example 20.3 Cup
Drawing

A drawing operation is used to form a cylindrical cup with inside diameter ¼ 75 mm and
height ¼ 50 mm. The starting blank size ¼ 138 mm and the stock thickness ¼ 2.4 mm. Based
on these data, is the operation feasible?
Solution: To assess feasibility, we determine the drawing ratio, reduction, and thicknessto-diameter ratio.
DR ¼ 138=75 ¼ 1:84
r ¼ ð138  75Þ=138 ¼ 0:4565 ¼ 45:65%
t=Db ¼ 2:4=138 ¼ 0:017 ¼ 1:7%
According to these measures, the drawing operation is feasible. The drawing ratio is less
than 2.0, the reduction is less than 50%, and the t/Db ratio is greater than 1%. These are
n
general guidelines frequently used to indicate technical feasibility.
Forces The drawing force required to perform a given operation can be estimated
roughly by the formula:


Db
F ¼ pDp tðTSÞ
 0:7
ð20:12Þ
Dp
where F ¼ drawing force, N (lb); t ¼ original blank thickness, mm (in); TS ¼ tensile
strength, MPa (lb/in2); and Db and Dp are the starting blank diameter and punch
diameter, respectively, mm (in). The constant 0.7 is a correction factor to account for
friction. Eq. (20.12) estimates the maximum force in the operation. The drawing force
varies throughout the downward movement of the punch, usually reaching its maximum
value at about one-third the length of the punch stroke.
The holding force is an important factor in a drawing operation. As a rough
approximation, the holding pressure can be set at a value ¼ 0.015 of the yield strength of
the sheet metal [8]. This value is then multiplied by that portion of the starting area of the
blank that is to be held by the blankholder. In equation form,
n

2 o
F h ¼ 0:015Yp D2b  Dp þ 2:2t þ 2Rd

ð20:13Þ

where Fh ¼ holding force in drawing, N (lb); Y ¼ yield strength of the sheet metal, MPa
(lb/in2); t ¼ starting stock thickness, mm (in); Rd ¼ die corner radius, mm (in); and the
other terms have been previously defined. The holding force is usually about one-third
the drawing force [10].

Blank Size Determination For the final dimensions to be achieved on the cylindrical
drawn shape, the correct starting blank diameter is needed. It must be large enough to
supply sufficient metal to complete the cup. Yet if there is too much material, unnecessary
waste will result. For drawn shapes other than cylindrical cups, the same problem of
estimating the starting blank size exists, only the shape of the blank may be other than round.
The following is a reasonable method for estimating the starting blank diameter in
a deep drawing operation that produces a round part (e.g., cylindrical cup and more
complex shapes so long as they are axisymmetric). Because the volume of the final
product is the same as that of the starting sheet-metal blank, then the blank diameter can
be calculated by setting the initial blank volume equal to the final volume of the product
and solving for diameter Db. To facilitate the calculation, it is often assumed that
negligible thinning of the part wall occurs.

20.3.3 OTHER DRAWING OPERATIONS
Our discussion has focused on a conventional cup-drawing operation that produces a
simple cylindrical shape in a single step and uses a blankholder to facilitate the process.
Let us consider some of the variations of this basic operation.
Redrawing If the shape change required by the part design is too severe (drawing ratio
is too high), complete forming of the part may require more than one drawing step. The
second drawing step, and any further drawing steps if needed, are referred to as
redrawing. A redrawing operation is illustrated in Figure 20.21.
When the part design indicates a drawing ratio that is too large to form the part in a
single step, the following is a general guide to the amount of reduction that can be taken in

FIGURE 20.21

each drawing operation [10]: For the first draw, the maximum reduction of the starting blank
should be 40% to 45%; for the second draw (first redraw), the maximum reduction should be
30%; and for the third draw (second redraw), the maximum reduction should be 16%.
A related operation is reverse drawing, in which a drawn part is positioned face
down on the die so that the second drawing operation produces a configuration such as
that shown in Figure 20.22. Although it may seem that reverse drawing would produce a
more severe deformation than redrawing, it is actually easier on the metal. The reason is
that the sheet metal is bent in the same direction at the outside and inside corners of the
die in reverse drawing; while in redrawing the metal is bent in the opposite directions at
the two corners. Because of this difference, the metal experiences less strain hardening in
reverse drawing and the drawing force is lower.
Drawing of Shapes Other than Cylindrical Cups Many products require drawing of
shapes other than cylindrical cups. The variety of drawn shapes include square or
rectangular boxes (as in sinks), stepped cups, cones, cups with spherical rather than flat
bases, and irregular curved forms (as in automobile body panels). Each of these shapes
presents unique technical problems in drawing. Eary and Reed [2] provide a detailed
discussion of the drawing of these kinds of shapes.
Drawing Without a Blankholder One of the primary functions of the blankholder is to
prevent wrinkling of the flange while the cup is being drawn. The tendency for wrinkling
is reduced as the thickness-to-diameter ratio of the blank increases. If the t=Db ratio is
large enough, drawing can be accomplished without a blankholder, as in Figure 20.23.

FIGURE 20.24 Common defects in drawn parts: (a) wrinkling can occur either in the flange or (b) in the
wall, (c) tearing, (d) earing, and (e) surface scratches.

The limiting condition for drawing without a blankholder can be estimated from the
following [5]:
Db  Dp < 5t

ð20:14Þ

The draw die must have the shape of a funnel or cone to permit the material to be drawn
properly into the die cavity. When drawing without a blankholder is feasible, it has the
advantages of lower cost tooling and a simpler press, because the need to separately control
the movements of the blankholder and punch can be avoided.

20.3.4 DEFECTS IN DRAWING
Sheet-metal drawing is a more complex operation than cutting or bending, and more
things can go wrong. A number of defects can occur in a drawn product, some of
which we have already alluded to. Following is a list of common defects, with sketches in
Figure 20.24:
(a) Wrinkling in the flange. Wrinkling in a drawn part consists of a series of ridges that
form radially in the undrawn flange of the workpart due to compressive buckling.
(b) Wrinkling in the wall. If and when the wrinkled flange is drawn into the cup, these
ridges appear in the vertical wall.
(c) Tearing. Tearing is an open crack in the vertical wall, usually near the base of the
drawn cup, due to high tensile stresses that cause thinning and failure of the metal at
this location. This type of failure can also occur as the metal is pulled over a sharp die
corner.
(d) Earing. This is the formation of irregularities (called ears) in the upper edge of a deep
drawn cup, caused by anisotropy in the sheet metal. If the material is perfectly
isotropic, ears do not form.
(e) Surface scratches. Surface scratches can occur on the drawn part if the punch and die
are not smooth or if lubrication is insufficient.

20.4

OTHER SHEET-METAL-FORMING OPERATIONS
In addition to bending and drawing, several other sheet-metal-forming operations can be
accomplished on conventional presses. We classify these as (1) operations performed with
metal tooling and (2) operations performed with flexible rubber tooling.

Note thinning and elongation of
walls. Symbols v and F indicate
motion and applied force,
respectively.

20.4.1 OPERATIONS PERFORMED WITH METAL TOOLING
Operations performed with metal tooling include (1) ironing, (2) coining and embossing,
(3) lancing, and (4) twisting.
Ironing In deep drawing the flange is compressed by the squeezing action of the blank
perimeter seeking a smaller circumference as it is drawn toward the die opening. Because
of this compression, the sheet metal near the outer edge of the blank becomes thicker as it
moves inward. If the thickness of this stock is greater than the clearance between the
punch and die, it will be squeezed to the size of the clearance, a process known as ironing.
Sometimes ironing is performed as a separate step that follows drawing. This
case is illustrated in Figure 20.25. Ironing makes the cylindrical cup more uniform in
wall thickness. The drawn part is therefore longer and more efficient in terms of
material usage. Beverage cans and artillery shells, two very high-production items,
include ironing among their processing steps to achieve economy in material usage.
Coining and Embossing Coining is a bulk deformation operation discussed in the
previous chapter. It is frequently used in sheet-metal work to form indentations and
raised sections in the part. The indentations result in thinning of the sheet metal, and the
raised sections result in thickening of the metal.
Embossing is a forming operation used to create indentations in the sheet, such as
raised (or indented) lettering or strengthening ribs, as depicted in Figure 20.26. Some
stretching and thinning of the metal are involved. This operation may seem similar to
coining. However, embossing dies possess matching cavity contours, the punch containing the positive contour and the die containing the negative; whereas coining dies may
have quite different cavities in the two die halves, thus causing more significant metal
deformation than embossing.

Lancing Lancing is a combined cutting and bending or cutting and forming operation
performed in one step to partially separate the metal from the sheet. Several examples are
shown in Figure 20.27. Among other applications, lancing is used to make louvers in sheetmetal air vents for heating and air conditioning systems in buildings.
Twisting Twisting subjects the sheet metal to a torsion loading rather than a bending
load, thus causing a twist in the sheet over its length. This type of operation has limited
applications. It is used to make such products as fan and propeller blades. It can be
performed in a conventional punch and die which has been designed to deform the part in
the required twist shape.

20.4.2 RUBBER FORMING PROCESSES
The two operations discussed in this article are performed on conventional presses, but
the tooling is unusual in that it uses a flexible element (made of rubber or similar
material) to effect the forming operation. The operations are (1) the Guerin process, and
(2) hydroforming.
Guerin Process The Guerin process uses a thick rubber pad (or other flexible material)
to form sheet metal over a positive form block, as in Figure 20.28. The rubber pad is
confined in a steel container. As the ram descends, the rubber gradually surrounds the
sheet, applying pressure to deform it to the shape of the form block. It is limited to relatively

shallow forms, because the pressures developed by the rubber—up to about 10 MPa
(1500 lb/in2)—are not sufficient to prevent wrinkling in deeper formed parts.
The advantage of the Guerin process is the relatively low cost of the tooling. The
form block can be made of wood, plastic, or other materials that are easy to shape, and the
rubber pad can be used with different form blocks. These factors make rubber forming
attractive in small-quantity production, such as the aircraft industry, where the process was
developed.
Hydroforming Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference is that it
substitutes a rubber diaphragm filled with hydraulic fluid in place of the thick rubber pad, as
illustrated in Figure 20.29. This allows the pressure that forms the workpart to be
increased—to around 100 MPa (15,000 lb/in2)—thus preventing wrinkling in deep formed
parts. In fact, deeper draws can be achieved with the hydroform process than with
conventional deep drawing. This is because the uniform pressure in hydroforming forces
the work to contact the punch throughout its length, thus increasing friction and reducing
the tensile stresses that cause tearing at the base of the drawn cup.

20.5 DIES AND PRESSES FOR SHEET-METAL PROCESSES
In this section we examine the punch-and-die tooling and production equipment used in
conventional sheet-metal processing.

20.5.1 DIES
Nearly all of the preceding pressworking operations are performed with conventional
punch-and-die tooling. The tooling is referred to as a die. It is custom-designed for the
particular part to be produced. The term stamping die is sometimes used for highproduction dies. Typical materials for stamping dies are tool steel types D, A, O, and S
(Table 6.5).

FIGURE 20.30
Components of a punch
and die for a blanking
operation.

Components of a Stamping Die The components of a stamping die to perform a
simple blanking operation are illustrated in Figure 20.30. The working components are
the punch and die, which perform the cutting operation. They are attached to the upper
and lower portions of the die set, respectively called the punch holder (or upper shoe) and
die holder (lower shoe). The die set also includes guide pins and bushings to ensure
proper alignment between the punch and die during the stamping operation. The die
holder is attached to the base of the press, and the punch holder is attached to the ram.
Actuation of the ram accomplishes the pressworking operation.
In addition to these components, a die used for blanking or hole-punching must include
a means of preventing the sheet metal from sticking to the punch when it is retracted upward
after the operation. The newly created hole in the stock is the same size as the punch, and it
tends to cling to the punch on its withdrawal. The device in the die that strips the sheet metal
from the punch is called a stripper. It is often a simple plate attached to the die as in Figure
20.30, with a hole slightly larger than the punch diameter.
For dies that process strips or coils of sheet metal, a device is required to stop the sheet
metal as it advances through the die between press cycles. That device is called (try to guess)
a stop. Stops range from simple solid pins located in the path of the strip to block its forward
motion, to more complex mechanisms synchronized to rise and retract with the actuation of
the press. The simpler stop is shown in Figure 20.30.
There are other components in pressworking dies, but the preceding description
provides an introduction to the terminology.
Types of Stamping Dies Aside from differences in stamping dies related to the
operations they perform (e.g., cutting, bending, drawing), other differences deal with
the number of separate operations to be performed in each press actuation and how they
are accomplished.
The type of die considered above performs a single blanking operation with each
stroke of the press and is called a simple die. Other dies that perform a single operation
include V-dies (Section 20.2.1). More complicated pressworking dies include compound
dies, combination dies, and progressive dies. A compound die performs two operations at
a single station, such as blanking and punching, or blanking and drawing [2]. A good
example is a compound die that blanks and punches a washer. A combination die is less
common; it performs two operations at two different stations in the die. Examples of
applications include blanking two different parts (e.g., right-hand and left-hand parts), or
blanking and then bending the same part [2].
A progressive die performs two or more operations on a sheet-metal coil at two or
more stations with each press stroke. The part is fabricated progressively. The coil is fed

from one station to the next and different operations (e.g., punching, notching, bending, and
blanking) are performed at each station. When the part exits the final station it has been
completed and separated (cut) from the remaining coil. Design of a progressive die begins
with the layout of the part on the strip or coil and the determination of which operations are
to be performed at each station. The result of this procedure is called the strip development.
A progressive die and associated strip development are illustrated in Figure 20.31.
Progressive dies can have a dozen or more stations. They are the most complicated and
most costly stamping dies, economically justified only for complex parts requiring multiple
operations at high-production rates.

20.5.2 PRESSES
A press used for sheet metalworking is a machine tool with a stationary bed and a
powered ram (or slide) that can be driven toward and away from the bed to perform
various cutting and forming operations. A typical press, with principal components
labeled, is diagrammed in Figure 20.32. The relative positions of the bed and ram are
established by the frame, and the ram is driven by mechanical or hydraulic power. When
a die is mounted in the press, the punch holder is attached to the ram, and the die holder is
attached to a bolster plate of the press bed.
Presses are available in a variety of capacities, power systems, and frame types. The
capacity of a press is its ability to deliver the required force and energy to accomplish the
stamping operation. This is determined by the physical size of the press and by its power
system. The power system refers to whether mechanical or hydraulic power is used and the
type of drive used to transmit the power to the ram. Production rate is another important
aspect of capacity. Type of frame refers to the physical construction of the press. There are two
frame types in common use: gap frame and straight-sided frame.
Gap Frame Presses The gap frame has the general configuration of the letter C and is
often referred to as a C-frame. Gap frame presses provide good access to the die, and

they are usually open in the back to permit convenient ejection of stampings or scrap. The
principal types of gap frame press are (a) solid gap frame, (b) adjustable bed, (c) openback inclinable, (d) press brake, and (e) turret press.
The solid gap frame (sometimes called simply a gap press) has one-piece construction,
as shown in Figure 20.32. Presses with this frame are rigid, yet the C-shape allows convenient
access from the sides for feeding strip or coil stock. They are available in a range of sizes, with
capacities up to around 9000 kN (1000 tons). The model shown in Figure 20.33 has a capacity
of 1350 kN (150 tons). The adjustable bed frame press is a variation of the gap frame, in
which an adjustable bed is added to accommodate various die sizes. The adjustment feature

results in some sacrifice of tonnage capacity. The open-back inclinable press has a C-frame
assembled to a base in such a way that the frame can be tilted back to various angles so that
the stampings fall through the rear opening by gravity. Capacities of open-back inclinable
presses range between 1 ton and around 2250 kN (250 tons). They can be operated at high
speeds—up to around 1000 strokes per minute.
The press brake is a gap frame press with a very wide bed. The model in Figure 20.34
has a bed width of 9.15 m (30 ft). This allows a number of separate dies (simple V-bending
dies are typical) to be set up in the bed, so that small quantities of stampings can be made
economically. These low quantities of parts, sometimes requiring multiple bends at
different angles, necessitate a manual operation. For a part requiring a series of bends, the
operator moves the starting piece of sheet metal through the desired sequence of bending
dies, actuating the press at each die, to complete the work needed.
Whereas press brakes are well adapted to bending operations, turret presses are
suited to situations in which a sequence of punching, notching, and related cutting
operations must be accomplished on sheet-metal parts, as in Figure 20.35. Turret presses
have a C-frame, although this construction is not obvious in Figure 20.36. The conventional ram and punch is replaced by a turret containing many punches of different sizes
and shapes. The turret works by indexing (rotating) to the position holding the punch to
perform the required operation. Beneath the punch turret is a corresponding die turret
that positions the die opening for each punch. Between the punch and die is the sheetmetal blank, held by an xy positioning system that operates by computer numerical
control (Section 38.3). The blank is moved to the required coordinate position for each
cutting operation.
Straight-sided Frame Presses For jobs requiring high tonnage, press frames with
greater structural rigidity are needed. Straight-sided presses have full sides, giving it a

box-like appearance as in Figure 20.37. This construction increases the strength and
stiffness of the frame. As a result, capacities up to 35,000 kN (4000 tons) are available in
straight-sided presses for sheet metalwork. Large presses of this frame type are used for
forging (Section 19.3).
In all of these presses, gap frame and straight-sided frame, the size is closely
correlated to tonnage capacity. Larger presses are built to withstand higher forces in
pressworking. Press size is also related to the speed at which it can operate. Smaller
presses are generally capable of higher production rates than larger presses.
Power and Drive Systems Power systems on presses are either hydraulic or mechanical. Hydraulic presses use a large piston and cylinder to drive the ram. This power
system typically provides longer ram strokes than mechanical drives and can develop
the full tonnage force throughout the entire stroke. However, it is slower. Its application for sheet metal is normally limited to deep drawing and other forming operations
where these load-stroke characteristics are advantageous. These presses are available
with one or more independently operated slides, called single action (single slide),
double action (two slides), and so on. Double-action presses are useful in deep drawing
operations where it is required to separately control the punch force and the blankholder force.
There are several types of drive mechanisms used on mechanical presses. These
include eccentric, crankshaft, and knuckle joint, illustrated in Figure 20.38. They convert the
rotational motion of a drive motor into the linear motion of the ram. A flywheel is used to
store the energy of the drive motor for use in the stamping operation. Mechanical presses
using these drives achieve very high forces at the bottom of their strokes, and are therefore
quite suited to blanking and punching operations. The knuckle joint delivers very high force
when it bottoms, and is therefore often used in coining operations.

SHEET-METAL OPERATIONS NOT PERFORMED ON PRESSES
A number of sheet-metal operations are not performed on conventional stamping presses. In
this section we examine several of these processes: (1) stretch forming, (2) roll bending and
forming, (3) spinning, and (4) high-energy-rate forming processes.

20.6.1 STRETCH FORMING
Stretch forming is a sheet-metal deformation process in which the sheet metal is
intentionally stretched and simultaneously bent in order to achieve shape change.
The process is illustrated in Figure 20.39 for a relatively simple and gradual bend.
The workpart is gripped by one or more jaws on each end and then stretched and bent
over a positive die containing the desired form. The metal is stressed in tension to a level
above its yield point. When the tension loading is released, the metal has been plastically
deformed. The combination of stretching and bending results in relatively little springback in the part. An estimate of the force required in stretch forming can be obtained by
multiplying the cross-sectional area of the sheet in the direction of pulling by the flow
stress of the metal. In equation form,
F ¼ LtY f

ð20:15Þ

where F ¼ stretching force, N (lb); L ¼ length of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to
stretching, mm (in); t ¼ instantaneous stock thickness, mm (in); and Yf ¼ flow stress of the
work metal, MPa (lb/in2). The die force Fdie shown in the figure can be determined by
balancing vertical force components.

Chapter 20/Sheet Metalworking

More complex contours than that shown in our figure are possible by stretch
forming, but there are limitations on how sharp the curves in the sheet can be. Stretch
forming is widely used in the aircraft and aerospace industries to economically produce
large sheet-metal parts in the low quantities characteristic of those industries.

20.6.2 ROLL BENDING AND ROLL FORMING
The operations described in this section use rolls to form sheet metal. Roll bending is an
operation in which (usually) large sheet-metal or plate-metal parts are formed into
curved sections by means of rolls. One possible arrangement of the rolls is pictured in
Figure 20.40. As the sheet passes between the rolls, the rolls are brought toward each
other to a configuration that achieves the desired radius of curvature on the work.
Components for large storage tanks and pressure vessels are fabricated by roll bending.
The operation can also be used to bend structural shapes, railroad rails, and tubes.
A related operation is roll straightening in which nonflat sheets (or other crosssectional forms) are straightened by passing them between a series of rolls. The rolls
subject the work to a sequence of decreasing small bends in opposite directions, thus
causing it to be straight at the exit.
Roll forming (also called contour roll forming) is a continuous bending process in
which opposing rolls are used to produce long sections of formed shapes from coil or strip
stock. Several pairs of rolls are usually required to progressively accomplish the bending of
the stock into the desired shape. The process is illustrated in Figure 20.41 for a U-shaped
section. Products made by roll forming include channels, gutters, metal siding sections (for
homes), pipes and tubing with seams, and various structural sections. Although roll forming
has the general appearance of a rolling operation (and the tooling certainly looks similar),
the difference is that roll forming involves bending rather than compressing the work.

FIGURE 20.40
Roll bending.

20.6.3 SPINNING
Spinning is a metal-forming process in which an axially symmetric part is gradually
shaped over a mandrel or form by means of a rounded tool or roller. The tool or roller
applies a very localized pressure (almost a point contact) to deform the work by axial and
radial motions over the surface of the part. Basic geometric shapes typically produced by
spinning include cups, cones, hemispheres, and tubes. There are three types of spinning
operations: (1) conventional spinning, (2) shear spinning, and (3) tube spinning.
Conventional Spinning Conventional spinning is the basic spinning operation. As
illustrated in Figure 20.42, a sheet-metal disk is held against the end of a rotating mandrel

of the desired inside shape of the final part, while the tool or roller deforms the metal
against the mandrel. In some cases, the starting workpart is other than a flat disk. The
process requires a series of steps, as indicated in the figure, to complete the shaping of the
part. The tool position is controlled either by a human operator, using a fixed fulcrum to
achieve the required leverage, or by an automatic method such as numerical control.
These alternatives are manual spinning and power spinning. Power spinning has the
capability to apply higher forces to the operation, resulting in faster cycle times and
greater work size capacity. It also achieves better process control than manual spinning.
Conventional spinning bends the metal around a moving circular axis to conform to
the outside surface of the axisymmetric mandrel. The thickness of the metal therefore
remains unchanged (more or less) relative to the starting disk thickness. The diameter of the
disk must therefore be somewhat larger than the diameter of the resulting part. The required
starting diameter can be figured by assuming constant volume, before and after spinning.
Applications of conventional spinning include production of conical and curved
shapes in low quantities. Very large diameter parts—up to 5 m (15 ft) or more—can be made
by spinning. Alternative sheet-metal processes would require excessively high die costs.
The form mandrel in spinning can be made of wood or other soft materials that are easy to
shape. It is therefore a low-cost tool compared to the punch and die required for deep
drawing, which might be a substitute process for some parts.
Shear Spinning In shear spinning, the part is formed over the mandrel by a shear
deformation process in which the outside diameter remains constant and the wall
thickness is therefore reduced, as in Figure 20.43. This shear straining (and consequent
thinning of the metal) distinguishes this process from the bending action in conventional
spinning. Several other names have been used for shear spinning, including flow turning,
shear forming, and spin forging. The process has been applied in the aerospace industry
to form large parts such as rocket nose cones.
For the simple conical shape in our figure, the resulting thickness of the spun wall
can be readily determined by the sine law relationship:
tf ¼ t sin a

ð20:16Þ

where tf ¼ the final thickness of the wall after spinning, t ¼ the starting thickness of the
disk, and a ¼ the mandrel angle (actually the half angle). Thinning is sometimes
quantified by the spinning reduction r:
r¼

t  tf

spinning: (1) setup and
(2) completion of process.

There are limits to the amount of thinning that the metal will endure in a spinning
operation before fracture occurs. The maximum reduction correlates well with reduction
of area in a tension test [8].
Tube Spinning Tube spinning is used to reduce the wall thickness and increase the
length of a tube by means of a roller applied to the work over a cylindrical mandrel, as in
Figure 20.44. Tube spinning is similar to shear spinning except that the starting workpiece
is a tube rather than a flat disk. The operation can be performed by applying the roller
against the work externally (using a cylindrical mandrel on the inside of the tube) or
internally (using a die to surround the tube). It is also possible to form profiles in the walls
of the cylinder, as in Figure 20.44(c), by controlling the path of the roller as it moves
tangentially along the wall.
Spinning reduction for a tube-spinning operation that produces a wall of uniform
thickness can be determined as in shear spinning by Eq. (20.17).

20.6.4 HIGH-ENERGY-RATE FORMING
Several processes have been developed to form metals using large amounts of energy
applied in a very short time. Owing to this feature, these operations are called high-

energy-rate forming (HERF) processes. They include explosive forming, electrohydraulic forming, and electromagnetic forming.
Explosive Forming Explosive forming involves the use of an explosive charge to form
sheet (or plate) metal into a die cavity. One method of implementing the process is
illustrated in Figure 20.45. The workpart is clamped and sealed over the die, and a
vacuum is created in the cavity beneath. The apparatus is then placed in a large vessel of
water. An explosive charge is placed in the water at a certain distance above the work.
Detonation of the charge results in a shock wave whose energy is transmitted by the
water to cause rapid forming of the part into the cavity. The size of the explosive charge
and the distance at which it is placed above the part are largely a matter of art and
experience. Explosive forming is reserved for large parts, typical of the aerospace
industry.
Electrohydraulic Forming Electrohydraulic forming is a HERF process in which a
shock wave to deform the work into a die cavity is generated by the discharge of electrical
energy between two electrodes submerged in a transmission fluid (water). Owing to its
principle of operation, this process is also called electric discharge forming. The setup for
the process is illustrated in Figure 20.46. Electrical energy is accumulated in large capacitors
and then released to the electrodes. Electrohydraulic forming is similar to explosive
forming. The difference is in the method of generating the energy and the smaller amounts
of energy that are released. This limits electrohydraulic forming to much smaller part sizes.

forming: (1) setup in which coil is

Electromagnetic Forming Electromagnetic forming, also called magnetic pulse forming, is a process in which sheet metal is deformed by the mechanical force of an electromagnetic field induced in the workpart by an energized coil. The coil, energized by a
capacitor, produces a magnetic field. This generates eddy currents in the work that produce
their own magnetic field. The induced field opposes the primary field, producing a
mechanical force that deforms the part into the surrounding cavity. Developed in the
1960s, electromagnetic forming is the most widely used HERF process [10]. It is typically
used to form tubular parts, as illustrated in Figure 20.47.

20.7 BENDING OF TUBE STOCK
Several methods of producing tubes and pipes are discussed in the previous chapter, and
tube spinning is described in Section 20.6.3. In this section, we examine methods by which
tubes are bent and otherwise formed. Bending of tube stock is more difficult than sheet
stock because a tube tends to collapse and fold when attempts are made to bend it.
Special flexible mandrels are usually inserted into the tube prior to bending to support
the walls during the operation.
Some of the terms in tube bending are defined in Figure 20.48. The radius of the
bend R is defined with respect to the centerline of the tube. When the tube is bent, the
wall on the inside of the bend is in compression, and the wall at the outside is in tension.
These stress conditions cause thinning and elongation of the outer wall and thickening
and shortening of the inner wall. As a result, there is a tendency for the inner and outer
walls to be forced toward each other to cause the cross section of the tube to flatten.
Because of this flattening tendency, the minimum bend radius R that the tube can be bent
is about 1.5 times the diameter D when a mandrel is used and 3.0 times D when no
mandrel is used [10]. The exact value depends on the wall factor WF, which is the
diameter D divided by wall thickness t. Higher values of WF increase the minimum bend

and terms for a bent tube: D ¼
outside diameter of tube, R ¼

radius; that is, tube bending is more difficult for thin walls. Ductility of the work material
is also an important factor in the process.
Several methods to bend tubes (and similar sections) are illustrated in Figure 20.49.
Stretch bending is accomplished by pulling and bending the tube around a fixed form block,
as in Figure 20.49(a). Draw bending is performed by clamping the tube against a form block,
and then pulling the tube through the bend by rotating the block as in (b). A pressure bar is
used to support the work as it is being bent. In compression bending, a wiper shoe is used to
wrap the tube around the contour of a fixed form block, as in (c). Roll bending (Section
20.6.2), generally associated with the forming of sheet stock, is also used for bending tubes
and other cross sections.

The material removal processes are a family of shaping
operations (Figure 1.4) in which excess material is removed
from a starting workpart so that what remains is the desired
final geometry. The ‘‘family tree’’ is shown in Figure 21.1.
The most important branch of the family is conventional
machining, in which a sharp cutting tool is used to mechanically cut the material to achieve the desired geometry.
The three principal machining processes are turning, drilling, and milling. The ‘‘other machining operations’’ in
Figure 21.1 include shaping, planing, broaching, and sawing. This chapter begins our coverage of machining, which
runs through Chapter 24.
Another group of material removal processes is the
abrasive processes, which mechanically remove material by
the action of hard, abrasive particles. This process group,
which includes grinding, is covered in Chapter 25. The
‘‘other abrasive processes’’ in Figure 21.1 include honing,
lapping, and superfinishing. Finally, there are the nontraditional processes, which use various energy forms other
than a sharp cutting tool or abrasive particles to remove
material. The energy forms include mechanical, electrochemical, thermal, and chemical.1 The nontraditional processes are discussed in Chapter 26.
Machining is a manufacturing process in which a
sharp cutting tool is used to cut away material to leave the

Some of the mechanical energy forms in the nontraditional processes
involve the use of abrasive particles, and so they overlap with the
abrasive processes in Chapter 25.

desired part shape. The predominant cutting action in machining involves shear deformation of the work material to form a chip; as the chip is removed, a new surface is
exposed. Machining is most frequently applied to shape metals. The process is illustrated
in the diagram of Figure 21.2.
Machining is one of the most important manufacturing processes. The Industrial
Revolution and the growth of the manufacturing-based economies of the world can be
traced largely to the development of the various machining operations (Historical Note
22.1). Machining is important commercially and technologically for several reasons:

å Variety of work materials. Machining can be applied to a wide variety of work
materials. Virtually all solid metals can be machined. Plastics and plastic composites
can also be cut by machining. Ceramics pose difficulties because of their high
hardness and brittleness; however, most ceramics can be successfully cut by the
abrasive machining processes discussed in Chapter 25.
å Variety of part shapes and geometric features. Machining can be used to create any
regular geometries, such as flat planes, round holes, and cylinders. By introducing
variations in tool shapes and tool paths, irregular geometries can be created, such as
screw threads and T-slots. By combining several machining operations in sequence,
shapes of almost unlimited complexity and variety can be produced.
å Dimensional accuracy. Machining can produce dimensions to very close tolerances.
Some machining processes can achieve tolerances of 0.025 mm (0.001 in), much
more accurate than most other processes.
å Good surface finishes. Machining is capable of creating very smooth surface finishes.
Roughness values less than 0.4 microns (16 m-in.) can be achieved in conventional
machining operations. Some abrasive processes can achieve even better finishes.
On the other hand, certain disadvantages are associated with machining and other
material removal processes:
å Wasteful of material. Machining is inherently wasteful of material. The chips
generated in a machining operation are wasted material. Although these chips
can usually be recycled, they represent waste in terms of the unit operation.
å Time consuming. A machining operation generally takes more time to shape a given
part than alternative shaping processes such as casting or forging.
Machining is generally performed after other manufacturing processes such as
casting or bulk deformation (e.g., forging, bar drawing). The other processes create the
general shape of the starting workpart, and machining provides the final geometry,
dimensions, and finish.

21.1

OVERVIEW OF MACHINING TECHNOLOGY
Machining is not just one process; it is a group of processes. The common feature is the
use of a cutting tool to form a chip that is removed from the workpart. To perform the
operation, relative motion is required between the tool and work. This relative motion is
achieved in most machining operations by means of a primary motion, called the cutting
speed, and a secondary motion, called the feed. The shape of the tool and its penetration
into the work surface, combined with these motions, produces the desired geometry of
the resulting work surface.
Types of Machining Operations There are many kinds of machining operations, each
of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture. We discuss
these operations in considerable detail in Chapter 22, but for now it is appropriate to
identify and define the three most common types: turning, drilling, and milling, illustrated
in Figure 21.3.
In turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a
rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape, as in Figure 21.3(a). The speed motion in
turning is provided by the rotating workpart, and the feed motion is achieved by the cutting
tool moving slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Drilling is
used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two

cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the workpart to
form the round hole, as in Figure 21.3(b). In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting
edges is fed slowly across the work material to generate a plane or straight surface. The
direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool’s axis of rotation. The speed motion
is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are peripheral
milling and face milling, as in Figure 21.3(c) and (d).
Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching, and
sawing (Section 22.6). Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included
within the category of machining. These processes commonly follow the conventional
machining operations and are used to achieve a superior surface finish on the workpart.
The Cutting Tool A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a
material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate a chip
from the parent work material, as in Figure 21.2. Connected to the cutting edge are two
surfaces of the tool: the rake face and the flank. The rake face, which directs the flow of the
newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle called the rake angle a. It is measured
relative to a plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive, as in
Figure 21.2(a), or negative as in (b). The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the
tool and the newly generated work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which
would degrade the finish. This flank surface is oriented at an angle called the relief angle.
Most cutting tools in practice have more complex geometries than those in Figure 21.2.
There are two basic types, examples of which are illustrated in Figure 21.4: (a) single-point
tools and (b) multiple-cutting-edge tools. A single-point tool has one cutting edge and is used
for operations such as turning. In addition to the tool features shown in Figure 21.2, there is
one tool point from which the name of this cutting tool is derived. During machining, the
point of the tool penetrates below the original work surface of the part. The point is usually
rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius. Multiple-cutting-edge tools have more

than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the workpart by rotating.
Drilling and milling use rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Figure 21.4(b) shows a helical
milling cutter used in peripheral milling. Although the shape is quite different from a singlepoint tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar. Single-point and multiple-cuttingedge tools and the materials used in them are discussed in more detail in Chapter 23.
Cutting Conditions Relative motion is required between the tool and work to perform
a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain cutting speed v.
In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This is a much slower
motion, called the feed f. The remaining dimension of the cut is the penetration of the
cutting tool below the original work surface, called the depth of cut d. Collectively, speed,
feed, and depth of cut are called the cutting conditions. They form the three dimensions
of the machining process, and for certain operations (e.g., most single-point tool
operations) they can be used to calculate the material removal rate for the process:
RMR ¼ vf d

ð21:1Þ

where RMR ¼ material removal rate, mm3/s (in3/min); v ¼ cutting speed, m/s (ft/min), which
must be converted to mm/s (in/min); f ¼ feed, mm (in); and d ¼ depth of cut, mm (in).
The cutting conditions for a turning operation are depicted in Figure 21.5. Typical
units used for cutting speed are m/s (ft/min). Feed in turning is expressed in mm/rev

FIGURE 21.5 Cutting

(in/rev), and depth of cut is expressed in mm (in). In other machining operations,
interpretations of the cutting conditions may differ. For example, in a drilling operation,
depth is interpreted as the depth of the drilled hole.
Machining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by purpose
and cutting conditions: roughing cuts and finishing cuts. Roughing cuts are used to
remove large amounts of material from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, in
order to produce a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece
for a subsequent finishing operation. Finishing cuts are used to complete the part and
achieve the final dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs,
one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two
finishing cuts. Roughing operations are performed at high feeds and depths—feeds of 0.4
to 1.25 mm/rev (0.015–0.050 in/rev) and depths of 2.5 to 20 mm (0.100–0.750 in) are
typical. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds and depths—feeds of 0.125 to 0.4
mm (0.005–0.015 in/rev) and depths of 0.75 to 2.0 mm (0.030–0.075 in) are typical. Cutting
speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing.
A cutting fluid is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate the
cutting tool (cutting fluids are discussed in Section 23.4). Determining whether a cutting
fluid should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper cutting fluid, is usually included within
the scope of cutting conditions. Given the work material and tooling, the selection of these
conditions is very influential in determining the success of a machining operation.
Machine Tools A machine tool is used to hold the workpart, position the tool relative
to the work, and provide power for the machining process at the speed, feed, and depth
that have been set. By controlling the tool, work, and cutting conditions, machine tools
permit parts to be made with great accuracy and repeatability, to tolerances of 0.025 mm
(0.001 in) and better. The term machine tool applies to any power-driven machine that
performs a machining operation, including grinding. The term is also applied to machines
that perform metal forming and pressworking operations (Chapters 19 and 20).
The traditional machine tools used to perform turning, drilling, and milling are
lathes, drill presses, and milling machines, respectively. Conventional machine tools are
usually tended by a human operator, who loads and unloads the workparts, changes
cutting tools, and sets the cutting conditions. Many modern machine tools are designed to
accomplish their operations with a form of automation called computer numerical
control (Section 38.3).

21.2 THEORY OF CHIP FORMATION IN METAL MACHINING
The geometry of most practical machining operations is somewhat complex. A simplified
model of machining is available that neglects many of the geometric complexities, yet
describes the mechanics of the process quite well. It is called the orthogonal cutting model,
Figure 21.6. Although an actual machining process is three-dimensional, the orthogonal
model has only two dimensions that play active roles in the analysis.

21.2.1 THE ORTHOGONAL CUTTING MODEL
By definition, orthogonal cutting uses a wedge-shaped tool in which the cutting edge is
perpendicular to the direction of cutting speed. As the tool is forced into the material, the
chip is formed by shear deformation along a plane called the shear plane, which is
oriented at an angle f with the surface of the work. Only at the sharp cutting edge of the
tool does failure of the material occur, resulting in separation of the chip from the parent

the side view.

material. Along the shear plane, where the bulk of the mechanical energy is consumed in
machining, the material is plastically deformed.
The tool in orthogonal cutting has only two elements of geometry: (1) rake angle and
(2) clearance angle. As indicated previously, the rake angle a determines the direction that
the chip flows as it is formed from the workpart; and the clearance angle provides a small
clearance between the tool flank and the newly generated work surface.
During cutting, the cutting edge of the tool is positioned a certain distance below
the original work surface. This corresponds to the thickness of the chip prior to chip
formation, to. As the chip is formed along the shear plane, its thickness increases to tc. The
ratio of to to tc is called the chip thickness ratio (or simply the chip ratio) r:
r¼

to
tc

ð21:2Þ

Since the chip thickness after cutting is always greater than the corresponding thickness
before cutting, the chip ratio will always be less than 1.0.
In addition to to, the orthogonal cut has a width dimension w, as shown in Figure 21.6(a),
even though this dimension does not contribute much to the analysis in orthogonal cutting.
The geometry of the orthogonal cutting model allows us to establish an important
relationship between the chip thickness ratio, the rake angle, and the shear plane angle. Let
ls be the length of the shear plane. We can make the substitutions: to ¼ ls sinf, and tc ¼ ls cos
(f  a). Thus,
r¼

ls sin f
sin f
¼
ls cos (f  a) cos (f  a)

This can be rearranged to determine f as follows:
tan f ¼

r cos a
1  r sin a

ð21:3Þ

The shear strain that occurs along the shear plane can be estimated by examining
Figure 21.7. Part (a) shows shear deformation approximated by a series of parallel plates
sliding against one another to form the chip. Consistent with our definition of shear strain

21.2.2 ACTUAL CHIP FORMATION
We should note that there are differences between the orthogonal model and an actual
machining process. First, the shear deformation process does not occur along a plane, but
within a zone. If shearing were to take place across a plane of zero thickness, it would imply
that the shearing action must occur instantaneously as it passes through the plane, rather
than over some finite (although brief) time period. For the material to behave in a realistic
way, the shear deformation must occur within a thin shear zone. This more realistic model of
the shear deformation process in machining is illustrated in Figure 21.8. Metal-cutting
experiments have indicated that the thickness of the shear zone is only a few thousandths of
an inch. Since the shear zone is so thin, there is not a great loss of accuracy in most cases by
referring to it as a plane.
Second, in addition to shear deformation that occurs in the shear zone, another
shearing action occurs in the chip after it has been formed. This additional shear is
referred to as secondary shear to distinguish it from primary shear. Secondary shear
results from friction between the chip and the tool as the chip slides along the rake face
of the tool. Its effect increases with increased friction between the tool and chip. The
primary and secondary shear zones can be seen in Figure 21.8.
Third, formation of the chip depends on the type of material being machined and
the cutting conditions of the operation. Four basic types of chip can be distinguished,
illustrated in Figure 21.9:
å Discontinuous chip. When relatively brittle materials (e.g., cast irons) are machined
at low cutting speeds, the chips often form into separate segments (sometimes the
segments are loosely attached). This tends to impart an irregular texture to the
machined surface. High tool–chip friction and large feed and depth of cut promote
the formation of this chip type.
å Continuous chip. When ductile work materials are cut at high speeds and relatively
small feeds and depths, long continuous chips are formed. A good surface finish
typically results when this chip type is formed. A sharp cutting edge on the tool and

low tool–chip friction encourage the formation of continuous chips. Long, continuous
chips (as in turning) can cause problems with regard to chip disposal and/or tangling
about the tool. To solve these problems, turning tools are often equipped with chip
breakers (Section 23.3.1).
å Continuous chip with built-up edge. When machining ductile materials at low-tomedium cutting speeds, friction between tool and chip tends to cause portions of the
work material to adhere to the rake face of the tool near the cutting edge. This
formation is called a built-up edge (BUE). The formation of a BUE is cyclical; it
forms and grows, then becomes unstable and breaks off. Much of the detached BUE
is carried away with the chip, sometimes taking portions of the tool rake face with it,
which reduces the life of the cutting tool. Portions of the detached BUE that are not
carried off with the chip become imbedded in the newly created work surface,
causing the surface to become rough.
The preceding chip types were first classified by Ernst in the late 1930s [13]. Since
then, the available metals used in machining, cutting tool materials, and cutting speeds
have all increased, and a fourth chip type has been identified:
å Serrated chips (the term shear-localized is also used for this fourth chip type). These
chips are semi-continuous in the sense that they possess a saw-tooth appearance that
is produced by a cyclical chip formation of alternating high shear strain followed by
low shear strain. This fourth type of chip is most closely associated with certain
difficult-to-machine metals such as titanium alloys, nickel-base superalloys, and
austenitic stainless steels when they are machined at higher cutting speeds. However,
the phenomenon is also found with more common work metals (e.g., steels) when
they are cut at high speeds [13].2

21.3 FORCE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE MERCHANT EQUATION
Several forces can be defined relative to the orthogonal cutting model. Based on these
forces, shear stress, coefficient of friction, and certain other relationships can be
defined.

A more complete description of the serrated chip type can be found in Trent & Wright [12], pp. 348–367.

21.3.1 FORCES IN METAL CUTTING
Consider the forces acting on the chip during orthogonal cutting in Figure 21.10(a). The forces
applied against the chip by the tool can be separated into two mutually perpendicular
components: friction force and normal force to friction. The friction force F is the frictional
force resisting the flow of the chip along the rake face of the tool. The normal force to friction N
is perpendicular to the friction force. These two components can be used to define the
coefficient of friction between the tool and the chip:
m¼

F
N

ð21:5Þ

The friction force and its normal force can be added vectorially to form a resultant
force R, which is oriented at an angle b, called the friction angle. The friction angle is
related to the coefficient of friction as
m ¼ tan b

ð21:6Þ

In addition to the tool forces acting on the chip, there are two force components applied
by the workpiece on the chip: shear force and normal force to shear. The shear force Fs is the
force that causes shear deformation to occur in the shear plane, and the normal force to shear
Fn is perpendicular to the shear force. Based on the shear force, we can define the shear stress
that acts along the shear plane between the work and the chip:
t¼

Fs
As

ð21:7Þ

where As ¼ area of the shear plane. This shear plane area can be calculated as
As ¼

to w
sin f

ð21:8Þ

The shear stress in Eq. (21.7) represents the level of stress required to perform the
machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of the work
material (t ¼ S) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.
Vector addition of the two force components Fs and Fn yields the resultant force R0 .
In order for the forces acting on the chip to be in balance, this resultant R0 must be equal
in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant R.

FIGURE 21.11 Force diagram showing
geometric relationships between F, N,
Fs, Fn, Fc, and Ft.

None of the four force components F, N, Fs, and Fn can be directly measured in a
machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary with different
tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible for the cutting tool to be
instrumented using a force measuring device called a dynamometer, so that two additional
force components acting against the tool can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust
force. The cutting force Fc is in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting
speed v, and the thrust force Ft is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the
chip thickness before the cut to. The cutting force and thrust force are shown in Figure 21.10
(b) together with their resultant force R00 . The respective directions of these forces are
known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be aligned accordingly.
Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot
be measured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in
Figure 21.11, the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:
F ¼ F c sin a þ F t cos a

ð21:9Þ

N ¼ F c cos a  F t sin a

ð21:10Þ

F s ¼ F c cos f  F t sin f

ð21:11Þ

F n ¼ F c sin f þ F t cos f

ð21:12Þ

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to calculate
estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based on these force
estimates, shear stress and coefficient of friction can be determined.
Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle a ¼ 0, Eqs. (21.9)
and (21.10) reduce to F ¼ Ft and N ¼ Fc, respectively. Thus, in this special case, friction force
and its normal force could be directly measured by the dynamometer.

Example 21.2
Shear Stress in
Machining

Suppose in Example 21.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured during an
orthogonal cutting operation: Fc ¼ 1559 N and Ft ¼ 1271 N. The width of the orthogonal
cutting operation w ¼ 3.0 mm. Based on these data, determine the shear strength of the
work material.
Solution: From Example 21.1, rake angle a ¼ 10 , and shear plane angle f ¼ 25.4 . Shear
force can be computed from Eq. (21.11):
F s ¼ 1559 cos 25:4  1271 sin 25:4 ¼ 863 N

The shear plane area is given by Eq. (21.8):

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the shear
strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more direct way.
Recalling from Eq. (21.7) that the shear force Fs ¼ S As, the force diagram of Figure 21.11
can be used to derive the following equations:
Fc ¼

Sto w cos (b  a)
F s cos (b  a)
¼
sin f cos(f þ b  a) cos(f þ b  a)

ð21:13Þ

Ft ¼

St w sin (b  a)
F s sin (b  a)
¼
sin f cos(f þ b  a) cos (f þ b  a)

ð21:14Þ

and

These equations allow one to estimate cutting force and thrust force in an orthogonal
cutting operation if the shear strength of the work material is known.

21.3.2 THE MERCHANT EQUATION
One of the important relationships in metal cutting was derived by Eugene Merchant
[10]. Its derivation was based on the assumption of orthogonal cutting, but its general
validity extends to three-dimensional machining operations. Merchant started with the
definition of shear stress expressed in the form of the following relationship derived by
combining Eqs. (21.7), (21.8), and (21.11):
t¼

F c cos f  F t sin f
(to w=sin f)

ð21:15Þ

Merchant reasoned that, out of all the possible angles emanating from the cutting
edge of the tool at which shear deformation could occur, there is one angle f that
predominates. This is the angle at which shear stress is just equal to the shear strength of
the work material, and so shear deformation occurs at this angle. For all other possible
shear angles, the shear stress is less than the shear strength, so chip formation cannot
occur at these other angles. In effect, the work material will select a shear plane angle that
minimizes energy. This angle can be determined by taking the derivative of the shear
stress S in Eq. (21.15) with respect to f and setting the derivative to zero. Solving for f, we
get the relationship named after Merchant:
f ¼ 45 þ

a b

2 2

ð21:16Þ

Among the assumptions in the Merchant equation is that shear strength of the work
material is a constant, unaffected by strain rate, temperature, and other factors. Because
this assumption is violated in practical machining operations, Eq. (21.16) must be

E1C21

considered an approximate relationship rather than an accurate mathematical equation.
Let us nevertheless consider its application in the following example.

Example 21.3
Estimating
Friction Angle

Using the data and results from our previous examples, determine (a) the friction angle
and (b) the coefficient of friction.
Solution: (a) From Example 21.1, a ¼ 10 , and f ¼ 25.4 . Rearranging Eq. (21.16),
the friction angle can be estimated:
b ¼ 2 (45) þ 10  2 (25:4) ¼ 49:2
(b) The coefficient of friction is given by Eq. (21.6):
m ¼ tan 49:2 ¼ 1:16

n

Lessons Based on the Merchant Equation The real value of the Merchant equation is
that it defines the general relationship between rake angle, tool–chip friction, and shear
plane angle. The shear plane angle can be increased by (1) increasing the rake angle and
(2) decreasing the friction angle (and coefficient of friction) between the tool and the
chip. Rake angle can be increased by proper tool design, and friction angle can be
reduced by using a lubricant cutting fluid.
The importance of increasing the shear plane angle can be seen in Figure 21.12. If all
other factors remain the same, a higher shear plane angle results in a smaller shear plane
area. Since the shear strength is applied across this area, the shear force required to form
the chip will decrease when the shear plane area is reduced. A greater shear plane angle
results in lower cutting energy, lower power requirements, and lower cutting temperature.
These are good reasons to try to make the shear plane angle as large as possible during
machining.
Approximation of Turning by Orthogonal Cutting The orthogonal model can be used
to approximate turning and certain other single-point machining operations so long as the
feed in these operations is small relative to depth of cut. Thus, most of the cutting will take
place in the direction of the feed, and cutting on the point of the tool will be negligible.
Figure 21.13 indicates the conversion from one cutting situation to the other.

FIGURE 21.12 Effect of shear plane angle f: (a) higher f with a resulting lower shear plane area;
(b) smaller f with a corresponding larger shear plane area. Note that the rake angle is larger in (a), which
tends to increase shear angle according to the Merchant equation.

The interpretation of cutting conditions is different in the two cases. The chip
thickness before the cut to in orthogonal cutting corresponds to the feed f in turning, and
the width of cut w in orthogonal cutting corresponds to the depth of cut d in turning. In
addition, the thrust force Ft in the orthogonal model corresponds to the feed force Ff in
turning. Cutting speed and cutting force have the same meanings in the two cases.
Table 21.1 summarizes the conversions.

21.4

POWER AND ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS IN MACHINING
A machining operation requires power. The cutting force in a production machining
operation might exceed 1000 N (several hundred pounds), as suggested by Example 21.2.
Typical cutting speeds are several hundred m/min. The product of cutting force and speed
gives the power (energy per unit time) required to perform a machining operation:
Pc ¼ F c v

ð21:17Þ

where Pc ¼ cutting power, N-m/s or W (ft-lb/min); Fc ¼ cutting force, N (lb); and v ¼
cutting speed, m/s (ft/min). In U.S. customary units, power is traditionally expressed as

E1C21

horsepower by dividing ft-lb/min by 33,000. Hence,
HPc ¼

F cv
33; 000

ð21:18Þ

where HPc ¼ cutting horsepower, hp. The gross power required to operate the machine
tool is greater than the power delivered to the cutting process because of mechanical losses
in the motor and drive train in the machine. These losses can be accounted for by the
mechanical efficiency of the machine tool:
Pg ¼

Pc
E

or

HPg ¼

HPc
E

ð21:19Þ

where Pg ¼ gross power of the machine tool motor, W; HPg ¼ gross horsepower; and E ¼
mechanical efficiency of the machine tool. Typical values of E for machine tools are
around 90%.
It is often useful to convert power into power per unit volume rate of metal cut. This
is called the unit power, Pu (or unit horsepower, HPu), defined:
Pu ¼

Pc
RMR

or

HPu ¼

HPc
RMR

ð21:20Þ

where RMR ¼ material removal rate, mm3/s (in3/min). The material removal rate can be
calculated as the product of vtow. This is Eq. (21.1) using the conversions from Table 21.1.
Unit power is also known as the specific energy U.
U ¼ Pu ¼

ð21:21Þ

The units for specific energy are typically N-m/mm3 (in-lb/in3). However, the last
expression in Eq. (21.21) suggests that the units might be reduced to N/mm2 (lb/in2).
It is more meaningful to retain the units as N-m/mm3 or J/mm3 (in-lb/in3).

Continuing with our previous examples, let us determine cutting power and specific
energy in the machining operation if the cutting speed ¼ 100 m/min. Summarizing the
data and results from previous examples, to ¼ 0.50 mm, w ¼ 3.0 mm, Fc ¼ 1557 N.
Solution:

From Eq. (21.18), power in the operation is

Pc ¼ (1557 N)(100 m/min) ¼ 155; 700 N  m/min ¼ 155; 700 J/min ¼ 2595 J/s ¼ 2595 W

Unit power and specific energy provide a useful measure of how much power (or
energy) is required to remove a unit volume of metal during machining. Using this
measure, different work materials can be compared in terms of their power and energy
requirements. Table 21.2 presents a listing of unit horsepower and specific energy values
for selected work materials.
The values in Table 21.2 are based on two assumptions: (1) the cutting tool is sharp,
and (2) the chip thickness before the cut to ¼ 0.25 mm (0.010 in). If these assumptions are
not met, some adjustments must be made. For worn tools, the power required to perform
the cut is greater, and this is reflected in higher specific energy and unit horsepower values.
As an approximate guide, the values in the table should be multiplied by a factor between
1.00 and 1.25 depending on the degree of dullness of the tool. For sharp tools, the factor is

1.00. For tools in a finishing operation that are nearly worn out, the factor is around 1.10,
and for tools in a roughing operation that are nearly worn out, the factor is 1.25.
Chip thickness before the cut to also affects the specific energy and unit horsepower
values. As to is reduced, unit power requirements increase. This relationship is referred to as
the size effect. For example, grinding, in which the chips are extremely small by comparison to
most other machining operations, requires very high specific energy values. The U and HPu
values in Table 21.2 can still be used to estimate horsepower and energy for situations in which
to is not equal to 0.25 mm (0.010 in) by applying a correction factor to account for any
difference in chip thickness before the cut. Figure 21.14 provides values of this correction

factor as a function of to. The unit horsepower and specific energy values in Table 21.2 should
be multiplied by the appropriate correction factor when to is different from 0.25 mm (0.010 in).
In addition to tool sharpness and size effect, other factors also influence the values of
specific energy and unit horsepower for a given operation. These other factors include rake
angle, cutting speed, and cutting fluid. As rake angle or cutting speed are increased, or when
cutting fluid is added, the U and HPu values are reduced slightly. For our purposes in the
end-of-chapter exercises, the effects of these additional factors can be ignored.

21.5 CUTTING TEMPERATURE
Of the total energy consumed in machining, nearly all of it (98%) is converted into heat.
This heat can cause temperatures to be very high at the tool–chip interface—over 600 C
(1100 F) is not unusual. The remaining energy (2%) is retained as elastic energy in the chip.
Cutting temperatures are important because high temperatures (1) reduce tool life,
(2) produce hot chips that pose safety hazards to the machine operator, and (3) can cause
inaccuracies in workpart dimensions due to thermal expansion of the work material. In this
section, we discuss the methods of calculating and measuring temperatures in machining
operations.

21.5.1 ANALYTICAL METHODS TO COMPUTE CUTTING TEMPERATURES
There are several analytical methods to calculate estimates of cutting temperature.
References [3], [5], [9], and [15] present some of these approaches. We describe the
method by Cook [5], which was derived using experimental data for a variety of work
materials to establish parameter values for the resulting equation. The equation can be
used to predict the increase in temperature at the tool–chip interface during machining:
DT ¼

0:4U vto 0:333
rC K

ð21:22Þ

where DT ¼ mean temperature rise at the tool–chip interface, C (F ); U ¼ specific energy
in the operation, N-m/mm3 or J/mm3 (in-lb/in3); v ¼ cutting speed, m/s (in/sec); to ¼ chip
thickness before the cut, m (in); rC ¼ volumetric specific heat of the work material, J/mm3C (in-lb/in3-F); K ¼ thermal diffusivity of the work material, m2/s (in2/sec).

Example 21.5
Cutting
Temperature

For the specific energy obtained in Example 21.4, calculate the increase in temperature
above ambient temperature of 20 C. Use the given data from the previous examples in this
chapter: v ¼ 100 m/min, to ¼ 0.50 mm. In addition, the volumetric specific heat for the work
material ¼ 3.0 (103) J/mm3-C, and thermal diffusivity ¼ 50 (106) m2/s (or 50 mm2/s).
Solution: Cutting speed must be converted to mm/s: v ¼ (100 m/min)(103 mm/m)/(60 s/
min) ¼ 1667 mm/s. Eq. (21.22) can now be used to compute the mean temperature rise:

21.5.2 MEASUREMENT OF CUTTING TEMPERATURE
Experimental methods have been developed to measure temperatures in machining.
The most frequently used measuring technique is the tool–chip thermocouple. This

thermocouple junction. By properly connecting electrical leads to the tool and workpart (which is connected to the chip), the voltage generated at the tool–chip interface
during cutting can be monitored using a recording potentiometer or other appropriate
data-collection device. The voltage output of the tool–chip thermocouple (measured in
mV) can be converted into the corresponding temperature value by means of calibration equations for the particular tool–work combination.
The tool–chip thermocouple has been utilized by researchers to investigate the
relationship between temperature and cutting conditions such as speed and feed. Trigger
[14] determined the speed–temperature relationship to be of the following general form:
T ¼ K vm

ð21:23Þ

where T ¼ measured tool–chip interface temperature and v ¼ cutting speed. The
parameters K and m depend on cutting conditions (other than v) and work material.

equations of the form of Eq. (21.23) determined for each material. A similar relationship
exists between cutting temperature and feed; however, the effect of feed on temperature
is not as strong as cutting speed. These empirical results tend to support the general
validity of the Cook equation: Eq. (21.22).

Machining is the most versatile and accurate of all manufacturing processes in its capability to produce a diversity
of part geometries and geometric features. Casting can also
produce a variety of shapes, but it lacks the precision and
accuracy of machining. In this chapter, we describe the
important machining operations and the machine tools
used to perform them. Historical Note 22.1 provides a brief
narrative of the development of machine tool technology.

22.1 MACHINING AND PART
GEOMETRY
To introduce our topic in this chapter, let us provide an
overview of the creation of part geometry by machining.
Machined parts can be classified as rotational or nonrotational (Figure 22.1). A rotational workpart has a cylindrical or
disk-like shape. The characteristic operation that produces
this geometry is one in which a cutting tool removes material
from a rotating workpart. Examples include turning and
boring. Drilling is closely related except that an internal
cylindrical shape is created and the tool rotates (rather
than the work) in most drilling operations. A nonrotational
(also called prismatic) workpart is block-like or plate-like, as
in Figure 22.1(b). This geometry is achieved by linear motions
of the workpart, combined with either rotating or linear tool
motions. Operations in this category include milling, shaping,
planing, and sawing.
Each machining operation produces a characteristic
geometry due to two factors: (1) the relative motions between the tool and the workpart and (2) the shape of the
cutting tool. We classify these operations by which part
shape is created as generating and forming. In generating,
the geometry of the workpart is determined by the feed
trajectory of the cutting tool. The path followed by the tool
during its feed motion is imparted to the work surface in
order to create shape. Examples of generating the work

Historical Note 22.1

Machine tool technology

aterial removal as a means of making things dates
back to prehistoric times, when man learned to carve
wood and chip stones to make hunting and farming
implements. There is archaeological evidence that the
ancient Egyptians used a rotating bowstring mechanism
to drill holes.
Development of modern machine tools is closely
related to the Industrial Revolution. When James Watt
designed his steam engine in England around 1763, one
of the technical problems he faced was to make the bore
of the cylinder sufficiently accurate to prevent steam
from escaping around the piston. John Wilkinson built a
water-wheel powered boring machine around 1775,
which permitted Watt to build his steam engine.
This boring machine is often recognized as the first
machine tool.
Another Englishman, Henry Maudsley, developed the
first screw-cutting lathe around 1800. Although the
turning of wood had been accomplished for many
centuries, Maudsley’s machine added a mechanized tool

carriage with which feeding and threading operations
could be performed with much greater precision than
any means before.
Eli Whitney is credited with developing the first
milling machine in the United States around 1818.
Development of the planer and shaper occurred in
England between 1800 and 1835, in response to the
need to make components for the steam engine, textile
equipment, and other machines associated with the
Industrial Revolution. The powered drill press was
developed by James Nasmyth around 1846, which
permitted drilling of accurate holes in metal.
Most of the conventional boring machines, lathes,
milling machines, planers, shapers, and drill presses used
today have the same basic designs as the early versions
developed during the last two centuries. Modern
machining centers—machine tools capable of
performing more than one type of cutting operation—
were introduced in the late 1950s, after numerical
control had been developed (Historical Note 38.1).

shape in machining include straight turning, taper turning, contour turning, peripheral
milling, and profile milling, all illustrated in Figure 22.2. In each of these operations,
material removal is accomplished by the speed motion in the operation, but part shape is
determined by the feed motion. The feed trajectory may involve variations in depth or
width of cut during the operation. For example, in the contour turning and profile milling
operations shown in our figure, the feed motion results in changes in depth and width,
respectively, as cutting proceeds.
In forming, the shape of the part is created by the geometry of the cutting tool. In
effect, the cutting edge of the tool has the reverse of the shape to be produced on the part
surface. Form turning, drilling, and broaching are examples of this case. In these
operations, illustrated in Figure 22.3, the shape of the cutting tool is imparted to the
work in order to create part geometry. The cutting conditions in forming usually include
the primary speed motion combined with a feeding motion that is directed into the work.

and flat parts.

Combination of forming
and generating to create
shape: (a) thread cutting
on a lathe, and (b) slot
milling.

Depth of cut in this category of machining usually refers to the final penetration into the
work after the feed motion has been completed.
Forming and generating are sometimes combined in one operation, as illustrated in
Figure 22.4 for thread cutting on a lathe and slotting on a milling machine. In thread
cutting, the pointed shape of the cutting tool determines the form of the threads, but the
large feed rate generates the threads. In slotting (also called slot milling), the width of the
cutter determines the width of the slot, but the feed motion creates the slot.
Machining is classified as a secondary process. In general, secondary processes
follow basic processes, whose purpose is to establish the initial shape of a workpiece.
Examples of basic processes include casting, forging, and bar rolling (to produce rod and
bar stock). The shapes produced by these processes usually require refinement by
secondary processes. Machining operations serve to transform the starting shapes into
the final geometries specified by the part designer. For example, bar stock is the initial
shape, but the final geometry after a series of machining operations is a shaft. We discuss
basic and secondary processes in more detail and provide additional examples in Section
40.1.1 on process planning.

22.2 TURNING AND RELATED OPERATIONS
Turning is a machining process in which a single-point tool removes material from the
surface of a rotating workpiece. The tool is fed linearly in a direction parallel to the axis of
rotation to generate a cylindrical geometry, as illustrated in Figures 22.2(a) and 22.5. Singlepoint tools used in turning and other machining operations are discussed in Section 23.3.1.
Turning is traditionally carried out on a machine tool called a lathe, which provides power
to turn the part at a given rotational speed and to feed the tool at a specified rate and depth
of cut. Included on the DVD that accompanies this text is a video clip on turning.

Turning

22.2.1 CUTTING CONDITIONS IN TURNING
The rotational speed in turning is related to the desired cutting speed at the surface of the
cylindrical workpiece by the equation
N¼

v
pDo

ð22:1Þ

where N ¼ rotational speed, rev/min; v ¼ cutting speed, m/min (ft/min); and Do ¼
original diameter of the part, m (ft).
The turning operation reduces the diameter of the work from its original diameter
Do to a final diameter Df, as determined by the depth of cut d:
Df ¼ Do  2d

ð22:2Þ

The feed in turning is generally expressed in mm/rev (in/rev). This feed can be converted
to a linear travel rate in mm/min (in/min) by the formula
f r ¼ Nf

ð22:3Þ

where fr ¼ feed rate, mm/min (in/min); and f ¼ feed, mm/rev (in/rev).
The time to machine from one end of a cylindrical workpart to the other is given by
Tm ¼

L
fr

ð22:4Þ

where Tm ¼ machining time, min; and L ¼ length of the cylindrical workpart, mm (in). A
more direct computation of the machining time is provided by the following equation:
Tm ¼

pDo L
fv

ð22:5Þ

where Do ¼ work diameter, mm (in); L ¼ workpart length, mm (in); f ¼ feed, mm/rev (in/
rev); and v ¼ cutting speed, mm/min (in/min). As a practical matter, a small distance is
usually added to the workpart length at the beginning and end of the piece to allow for
approach and overtravel of the tool. Thus, the duration of the feed motion past the work
will be longer than Tm.

Chapter 22/Machining Operations and Machine Tools

The volumetric rate of material removal can be most conveniently determined by
the following equation:
RMR ¼ vf d

ð22:6Þ

where RMR ¼ material removal rate, mm3/min (in3/min). In using this equation, the units for f
are expressed simply as mm (in), in effect neglecting the rotational character of turning. Also,
care must be exercised to ensure that the units for speed are consistent with those for f and d.

22.2.2 OPERATIONS RELATED TO TURNING
A variety of other machining operations can be performed on a lathe in addition to
turning; these include the following, illustrated in Figure 22.6:

FIGURE 22.6 Machining operations other than turning that are performed on a lathe: (a) facing, (b) taper turning,
(c) contour turning, (d) form turning, (e) chamfering, (f) cutoff, (g) threading, (h) boring, (i) drilling, and (j) knurling.

Section 22.2/Turning and Related Operations

513

(a) Facing. The tool is fed radially into the rotating work on one end to create a flat
surface on the end.
(b) Taper turning. Instead of feeding the tool parallel to the axis of rotation of the work,
the tool is fed at an angle, thus creating a tapered cylinder or conical shape.
(c) Contour turning. Instead of feeding the tool along a straight line parallel to the axis of
rotation as in turning, the tool follows a contour that is other than straight, thus
creating a contoured form in the turned part.
(d) Form turning. In this operation, sometimes called forming, the tool has a shape that is
imparted to the work by plunging the tool radially into the work.
(e) Chamfering. The cutting edge of the tool is used to cut an angle on the corner of the
cylinder, forming what is called a ‘‘chamfer.’’
(f) Cutoff. The tool is fed radially into the rotating work at some location along its length
to cut off the end of the part. This operation is sometimes referred to as parting.
(g) Threading. A pointed tool is fed linearly across the outside surface of the rotating
workpart in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation at a large effective feed rate, thus
creating threads in the cylinder. Methods of machining screw threads are discussed in
greater detail in Section 22.7.1.
(h) Boring. A single-point tool is fed linearly, parallel to the axis of rotation, on the inside
diameter of an existing hole in the part.
(i) Drilling. Drilling can be performed on a lathe by feeding the drill into the rotating
work along its axis. Reaming can be performed in a similar way.
(j) Knurling. This is not a machining operation because it does not involve cutting of
material. Instead, it is a metal forming operation used to produce a regular crosshatched pattern in the work surface.
Most lathe operations use single-point tools, which we discuss in Section 23.3.1.
Turning, facing, taper turning, contour turning, chamfering, and boring are all performed
with single-point tools. A threading operation is accomplished using a single-point tool
designed with a geometry that shapes the thread. Certain operations require tools other
than single-point. Form turning is performed with a specially designed tool called a form
tool. The profile shape ground into the tool establishes the shape of the workpart. A
cutoff tool is basically a form tool. Drilling is accomplished by a drill bit (Section 23.3.2).
Knurling is performed by a knurling tool, consisting of two hardened forming rolls, each
mounted between centers. The forming rolls have the desired knurling pattern on their
surfaces. To perform knurling, the tool is pressed against the rotating workpart with
sufficient pressure to impress the pattern onto the work surface.

22.2.3 THE ENGINE LATHE
The basic lathe used for turning and related operations is an engine lathe. It is a versatile
machine tool, manually operated, and widely used in low and medium production. The term
engine dates from the time when these machines were driven by steam engines.
Engine Lathe Technology Figure 22.7 is a sketch of an engine lathe showing its
principal components. The headstock contains the drive unit to rotate the spindle, which
rotates the work. Opposite the headstock is the tailstock, in which a center is mounted to
support the other end of the workpiece.
The cuttingtool isheld in a tool postfastened to thecross-slide,which isassembled to the
carriage. The carriage is designed to slide along the ways of the lathe in order to feed the tool
parallel to the axis of rotation. The ways are like tracks along which the carriage rides, and they

components.

aremadewithgreatprecisiontoachieveahighdegreeofparallelismrelativetothespindleaxis.
The ways are built into the bed of the lathe, providing a rigid frame for the machine tool.
The carriage is driven by a leadscrew that rotates at the proper speed to obtain the
desired feed rate. The cross-slide is designed to feed in a direction perpendicular to the
carriage movement. Thus, by moving the carriage, the tool can be fed parallel to the work
axis to perform straight turning; or by moving the cross-slide, the tool can be fed radially
into the work to perform facing, form turning, or cutoff operations.
The conventional engine lathe and most other machines described in this section are
horizontal turning machines; that is, the spindle axis is horizontal. This is appropriate for
the majority of turning jobs, in which the length is greater than the diameter. For jobs in
which the diameter is large relative to length and the work is heavy, it is more convenient to
orient the work so that it rotates about a vertical axis; these are vertical turning machines.
The size of a lathe is designated by swing and maximum distance between centers.
The swing is the maximum workpart diameter that can be rotated in the spindle, determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the ways of the
machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that can be accommodated
on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage and cross-slide assembly are in
the way. The maximum distance between centers indicates the maximum length of a
workpiece that can be mounted between headstock and tailstock centers. For example, a
350 mm  1.2 m (14 in  48 in) lathe designates that the swing is 350 mm (14 in) and the
maximum distance between centers is 1.2 m (48 in).
Methods of Holding the Work in a Lathe There are four common methods used to hold
workparts in turning. These workholding methods consist of various mechanisms to grasp
the work, center and support it in position along the spindle axis, and rotate it. The methods,
illustrated in Figure 22.8, are (a) mounting the work between centers, (b) chuck, (c) collet,
and (d) face plate. Our video clip on workholding illustrates the various aspects of
fixturing for turning and other machining operations.

FIGURE 22.8 Four workholding methods used in lathes: (a) mounting the work between centers using a dog,
(b) three-jaw chuck, (c) collet, and (d) faceplate for noncylindrical workparts.

Holding the work between centers refers to the use of two centers, one in the
headstock and the other in the tailstock, as in Figure 22.8(a). This method is appropriate
for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios. At the headstock center, a device called a dog
is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the spindle. The
tailstock center has a cone-shaped point which is inserted into a tapered hole in the end of
the work. The tailstock center is either a ‘‘live’’ center or a ‘‘dead’’ center. A live center
rotates in a bearing in the tailstock, so that there is no relative rotation between the work
and the live center, hence, no friction between the center and the workpiece. In contrast, a
dead center is fixed to the tailstock, so that it does not rotate; instead, the workpiece rotates
about it. Because of friction and the heat buildup that results, this setup is normally used at
lower rotational speeds. The live center can be used at higher speeds.
The chuck, Figure 22.8(b), is available in several designs, with three or four jaws to
grasp the cylindrical workpart on its outside diameter. The jaws are often designed so they
can also grasp the inside diameter of a tubular part. A self-centering chuck has a mechanism
to move the jaws in or out simultaneously, thus centering the work at the spindle axis. Other
chucks allow independent operation of each jaw. Chucks can be used with or without a
tailstock center. For parts with low length-to-diameter ratios, holding the part in the chuck
in a cantilever fashion is usually sufficient to withstand the cutting forces. For long
workbars, the tailstock center is needed for support.
A collet consists of a tubular bushing with longitudinal slits running over half its
length and equally spaced around its circumference, as in Figure 22.8(c). The inside
diameter of the collet is used to hold cylindrical work such as barstock. Owing to the slits,
one end of the collet can be squeezed to reduce its diameter and provide a secure grasping
pressure against the work. Because there is a limit to the reduction obtainable in a collet

E1C22

15:27:26

Page 516

Chapter 22/Machining Operations and Machine Tools

of any given diameter, these workholding devices must be made in various sizes to match
the particular workpart size in the operation.
A face plate, Figure 22.8(d), is a workholding device that fastens to the lathe spindle
and is used to grasp parts with irregular shapes. Because of their irregular shape, these parts
cannot be held by other workholding methods. The faceplate is therefore equipped with the
custom-designed clamps for the particular geometry of the part.

22.2.4 OTHER LATHES AND TURNING MACHINES
In addition to the engine lathe, other turning machines have been developed to satisfy
particular functions or to automate the turning process. Among these machines are
(1) toolroom lathe, (2) speed lathe, (3) turret lathe, (4) chucking machine, (5) automatic
screw machine, and (6) numerically controlled lathe.
The toolroom lathe and speed lathe are closely related to the engine lathe. The
toolroom lathe is smaller and has a wider available range of speeds and feeds. It is also
built for higher accuracy, consistent with its purpose of fabricating components for tools,
fixtures, and other high-precision devices.
The speed lathe is simpler in construction than the engine lathe. It has no carriage and
cross-slide assembly, and therefore no leadscrew to drive the carriage. The cutting tool is
held by the operator using a rest attached to the lathe for support. The speeds are higher on
a speed lathe, but the number of speed settings is limited. Applications of this machine type
include wood turning, metal spinning, and polishing operations.
A turret lathe is a manually operated lathe in which the tailstock is replaced by a turret
that holds up to six cutting tools. These tools can be rapidly brought into action against the work
one by one by indexing the turret. In addition, the conventional tool post used on an engine
lathe is replaced by a four-sided turret that is capable of indexing up to four tools into position.
Hence, because of the capacity to quickly change from one cutting tool to the next, the turret
lathe is used for high-production work that requires a sequence of cuts to be made on the part.
As the name suggests, a chucking machine (nicknamed chucker) uses a chuck in its
spindle to hold the workpart. The tailstock is absent on a chucker, so parts cannot be
mounted between centers. This restricts the use of a chucking machine to short, lightweight parts. The setup and operation are similar to a turret lathe except that the feeding
actions of the cutting tools are controlled automatically rather than by a human operator.
The function of the operator is to load and unload the parts.
A bar machine is similar to a chucking machine except that a collet is used (instead of
a chuck), which permits long bar stock to be fed through the headstock into position. At the
end of each machining cycle, a cutoff operation separates the new part. The bar stock is then
indexed forward to present stock for the next part. Feeding the stock as well as indexing and
feeding the cutting tools is accomplished automatically. Owing to its high level of automatic
operation, it is often called an automatic bar machine. One of its important applications is
in the production of screws and similar small hardware items; the name automatic screw
machine is frequently used for machines used in these applications.
Bar machines can be classified as single spindle or multiple spindle. A single spindle
bar machine has one spindle that normally allows only one cutting tool to be used at a time
on the single workpart being machined. Thus, while each tool is cutting the work, the other
tools are idle. (Turret lathes and chucking machines are also limited by this sequential,
rather than simultaneous, tool operation). To increase cutting tool utilization and production rate, multiple spindle bar machines are available. These machines have more than one
spindle, so multiple parts are machined simultaneously by multiple tools. For example, a sixspindle automatic bar machine works on six parts at a time, as in Figure 22.9. At the end of
each machining cycle, the spindles (including collets and workbars) are indexed (rotated) to
the next position. In our illustration, each part is cut sequentially by five sets of cutting tools,

which takes six cycles (position 1 is for advancing the bar stock to a ‘‘stop’’). With this
arrangement, a part is completed at the end of each cycle. As a result, a six-spindle
automatic screw machine has a very high production rate.
The sequencing and actuation of the motions on screw machines and chucking
machines have traditionally been controlled by cams and other mechanical devices. The
modern form of control is computer numerical control (CNC), in which the machine tool
operations are controlled by a ‘‘program of instructions’’ consisting of alphanumeric code
(Section 38.3). CNC provides a more sophisticated and versatile means of control than
mechanical devices. This has led to the development of machine tools capable of more
complex machining cycles and part geometries, and a higher level of automated operation
than conventional screw machines and chucking machines. The CNC lathe is an example of
these machines in turning. It is especially useful for contour turning operations and close
tolerance work. Today, automatic chuckers and bar machines are implemented by CNC.

22.2.5 BORING MACHINES
Boring is similar to turning. It uses a single-point tool against a rotating workpart. The
difference is that boring is performed on the inside diameter of an existing hole rather than
the outside diameter of an existing cylinder. In effect, boring is an internal turning operation.
Machine tools used to perform boring operations are called boring machines (also boring
mills). One might expect that boring machines would have features in common with turning
machines; indeed, as previously indicated, lathes are sometimes used to accomplish boring.
Boring mills can be horizontal or vertical. The designation refers to the orientation of
the axis of rotation of the machine spindle or workpart. In a horizontal boring operation,
the setup can be arranged in either of two ways. The first setup is one in which the work is
fixtured to a rotating spindle, and the tool is attached to a cantilevered boring bar that feeds

FIGURE 22.10 Two forms of horizontal boring: (a) boring bar is fed into a rotating workpart, and (b) work is fed past a

into the work, as illustrated in Figure 22.10(a). The boring bar in this setup must be very stiff
to avoid deflection and vibration during cutting. To achieve high stiffness, boring bars are
often made of cemented carbide, whose modulus of elasticity approaches 620  103 MPa
(90  106 lb/in2). Figure 22.11 shows a carbide boring bar.
The second possible setup is one in which the tool is mounted to a boring bar, and
the boring bar is supported and rotated between centers. The work is fastened to a
feeding mechanism that feeds it past the tool. This setup, Figure 22.10(b), can be used to
perform a boring operation on a conventional engine lathe.
A vertical boring machine is used for large, heavy workparts with large diameters;
usually the workpart diameter is greater than its length. As in Figure 22.12, the part is
clamped to a worktable that rotates relative to the machine base. Worktables up to 40 ft in
diameter are available. The typical boring machine can position and feed several cutting

tools simultaneously. The tools are mounted on tool heads that can be fed horizontally and
vertically relative to the worktable. One or two heads are mounted on a horizontal cross-rail
assembled to the machine tool housing above the worktable. The cutting tools mounted
above the work can be used for facing and boring. In addition to the tools on the cross-rail,
one or two additional tool heads can be mounted on the side columns of the housing to
enable turning on the outside diameter of the work.
The tool heads used on a vertical boring machine often include turrets to
accommodate several cutting tools. This results in a loss of distinction between this
machine and a vertical turret lathe. Some machine tool builders make the distinction that
the vertical turret lathe is used for work diameters up to 2.5 m (100 in), while the vertical
boring machine is used for larger diameters [7]. Also, vertical boring mills are often
applied to one-of-a-kind jobs, while vertical turret lathes are used for batch production.

22.3

DRILLING AND RELATED OPERATIONS
Drilling, Figure 22.3(b), is a machining operation used to create a round hole in a
workpart. This contrasts with boring, which can only be used to enlarge an existing hole.
Drilling is usually performed with a rotating cylindrical tool that has two cutting edges
on its working end. The tool is called a drill or drill bit (described in Section 23.3.2). The
most common drill bit is the twist drill, described in Section 23.3.2. The rotating drill
feeds into the stationary workpart to form a hole whose diameter is equal to the drill
diameter. Drilling is customarily performed on a drill press, although other machine
tools also perform this operation. The video clip on hole making illustrates the drilling
operation.

Chapter 22/Machining Operations and Machine Tools

22.3.1 CUTTING CONDITIONS IN DRILLING
The cutting speed in a drilling operation is the surface speed at the outside diameter of
the drill. It is specified in this way for convenience, even though nearly all of the cutting is
actually performed at lower speeds closer to the axis of rotation. To set the desired cutting
speed in drilling, it is necessary to determine the rotational speed of the drill. Letting N
represent the spindle rev/min,
N¼

v
pD

ð22:7Þ

where v ¼ cutting speed, mm/min (in/min); and D ¼ the drill diameter, mm (in). In some
drilling operations, the workpiece is rotated about a stationary tool, but the same formula
applies.
Feed f in drilling is specified in mm/rev (in/rev). Recommended feeds are roughly
proportional to drill diameter; higher feeds are used with larger diameter drills. Since
there are (usually) two cutting edges at the drill point, the uncut chip thickness (chip
load) taken by each cutting edge is half the feed. Feed can be converted to feed rate using
the same equation as for turning:
f r ¼ Nf

ð22:8Þ

where fr ¼ feed rate, mm/min (in/min).
Drilled holes are either through holes or blind holes, Figure 22.13. In through holes,
the drill exits the opposite side of the work; in blind holes, it does not. The machining
time required to drill a through hole can be determined by the following formula:
Tm ¼

tþA
fr

ð22:9Þ

where Tm ¼ machining (drilling) time, min; t ¼ work thickness, mm (in); fr ¼ feed rate,
mm/min (in/min); and A ¼ an approach allowance that accounts for the drill point angle,
representing the distance the drill must feed into the work before reaching full diameter,
Figure 22.10(a). This allowance is given by


u
A ¼ 0:5 D tan 90 
ð22:10Þ
2
where A ¼ approach allowance, mm (in); and u ¼ drill point angle. In drilling a through
hole, the feed motion usually proceeds slightly beyond the opposite side of the work,

FIGURE 22.13 Two
hole types: (a) through
hole and (b) blind hole.

521

thus making the actual duration of the cut greater than Tm in Eq. (22.9) by a small
amount.
In a blind-hole, hole depth d is defined as the distance from the work surface to the
depth of the full diameter, Figure 22.13(b). Thus, for a blind hole, machining time is given by
Tm ¼

dþA
fr

ð22:11Þ

where A ¼ the approach allowance by Eq. (22.10).
The rate of metal removal in drilling is determined as the product of the drill crosssectional area and the feed rate:
RMR ¼

pD2 f r
4

ð22:12Þ

This equation is valid only after the drill reaches full diameter and excludes the initial
approach of the drill into the work.

22.3.2 OPERATIONS RELATED TO DRILLING
Several operations are related to drilling. These are illustrated in Figure 22.14 and described
in this section. Most of the operations follow drilling; a hole must be made first by drilling,
and then the hole is modified by one of the other operations. Centering and spot facing are
exceptions to this rule. All of the operations use rotating tools.
(a) Reaming. Reaming is used to slightly enlarge a hole, to provide a better tolerance on
its diameter, and to improve its surface finish. The tool is called a reamer, and it usually
has straight flutes.
(b) Tapping. This operation is performed by a tap and is used to provide internal screw
threads on an existing hole. Tapping is discussed in more detail in Section 22.7.1.

(c) Counterboring. Counterboring provides a stepped hole, in which a larger diameter
follows a smaller diameter partially into the hole. A counterbored hole is used to seat
bolt heads into a hole so the heads do not protrude above the surface.
(d) Countersinking. This is similar to counterboring, except that the step in the hole is
cone-shaped for flat head screws and bolts.
(e) Centering. Also called center drilling, this operation drills a starting hole to accurately
establish its location for subsequent drilling. The tool is called a center drill.
(f) Spot facing. Spot facing is similar to milling. It is used to provide a flat machined
surface on the workpart in a localized area.

22.3.3 DRILL PRESSES
The standard machine tool for drilling is the drill press. There are various types of drill press,
the most basic of which is the upright drill, Figure 22.15. The upright drill stands on the floor
and consists of a table for holding the workpart, a drilling head with powered spindle for the
drill bit, and a base and column for support. A similar drill press, but smaller, is the bench
drill, which is mounted on a table or bench rather than the floor.
The radial drill, Figure 22.16, is a large drill press designed to cut holes in large
parts. It has a radial arm along which the drilling head can be moved and clamped. The
head therefore can be positioned along the arm at locations that are a significant distance
from the column to accommodate large work. The radial arm can also be swiveled about
the column to drill parts on either side of the worktable.
The gang drill is a drill press consisting basically of two to six upright drills connected
together in an in-line arrangement. Each spindle is powered and operated independently,
and they share a common worktable, so that a series of drilling and related operations can
be accomplished in sequence (e.g., centering, drilling, reaming, tapping) simply by sliding
the workpart along the worktable from one spindle to the next. A related machine is the
multiple-spindle drill, in which several drill spindles are connected together to drill
multiple holes simultaneously into the workpart.
In addition, CNC drill presses are available to control the positioning of the holes in
the workparts. These drill presses are often equipped with turrets to hold multiple tools that
can be indexed under control of the CNC program. The term CNC turret drill is used for
these machine tools.
Workholding on a drill press is accomplished by clamping the part in a vise, fixture,
or jig. A vise is a general-purpose workholding device possessing two jaws that grasp the

work in position. A fixture is a workholding device that is usually custom-designed for the
particular workpart. The fixture can be designed to achieve higher accuracy in positioning the part relative to the machining operation, faster production rates, and greater
operator convenience in use. A jig is a workholding device that is also specially designed
for the workpart. The distinguishing feature between a jig and a fixture is that the jig
provides a means of guiding the tool during the drilling operation. A fixture does not
provide this tool guidance feature. A jig used for drilling is called a drill jig.

22.4

MILLING
Milling is a machining operation in which a workpart is fed past a rotating cylindrical tool
with multiple cutting edges, as illustrated in Figure 22.2(d) and (e). (In rare cases, a tool
with one cutting edge, called a fly-cutter, is used). The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is
perpendicular to the direction of feed. This orientation between the tool axis and the feed
direction is one of the features that distinguishes milling from drilling. In drilling, the
cutting tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation. The cutting tool in milling is
called a milling cutter and the cutting edges are called teeth. Aspects of milling cutter

geometry are discussed in Section 23.3.2. The conventional machine tool that performs
this operation is a milling machine. The reader can view milling operations and the
various milling machines in our video clip on milling and machining centers.
VIDEO CLIP
Milling and Machining Center Basics. View the segment titled Milling Cutters and
Operations.

The geometric form created by milling is a plane surface. Other work geometries
can be created either by means of the cutter path or the cutter shape. Owing to the variety
of shapes possible and its high production rates, milling is one of the most versatile and
widely used machining operations.
Milling is an interrupted cutting operation; the teeth of the milling cutter enter and
exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to
a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter
geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions.

22.4.1 TYPES OF MILLING OPERATIONS
There are two basic types of milling operations, shown in Figure 22.17: (a) peripheral
milling and (b) face milling. Most milling operations create geometry by generating the
shape (Section 22.1).
Peripheral Milling In peripheral milling, also called plain milling, the axis of the tool is
parallel to the surface being machined, and the operation is performed by cutting edges
on the outside periphery of the cutter. Several types of peripheral milling are shown in
Figure 22.18: (a) slab milling, the basic form of peripheral milling in which the cutter
width extends beyond the workpiece on both sides; (b) slotting, also called slot milling,
in which the width of the cutter is less than the workpiece width, creating a slot in the
work—when the cutter is very thin, this operation can be used to mill narrow slots or cut a
workpart in two, called saw milling; (c) side milling, in which the cutter machines the
side of the workpiece; (d) straddle milling, the same as side milling, only cutting takes
place on both sides of the work; and form milling, in which the milling teeth have a

(e)

special profile that determines the shape of the slot that is cut in the work. Form milling is
therefore classified as a forming operation (Section 22.1).
In peripheral milling, the direction of cutter rotation distinguishes two forms of
milling: up milling and down milling, illustrated in Figure 22.19. In up milling, also called
conventional milling, the direction of motion of the cutter teeth is opposite the feed
direction when the teeth cut into the work. It is milling ‘‘against the feed.’’ In down
milling, also called climb milling, the direction of cutter motion is the same as the feed
direction when the teeth cut the work. It is milling ‘‘with the feed.’’
The relative geometries of these two forms of milling result in differences in their
cutting actions. In up milling, the chip formed by each cutter tooth starts out very thin and
increases in thickness during the sweep of the cutter. In down milling, each chip starts out
thick and reduces in thickness throughout the cut. The length of a chip in down milling is
less than in up milling (the difference is exaggerated in our figure). This means that the
cutter is engaged in the work for less time per volume of material cut, and this tends to
increase tool life in down milling.
The cutting force direction is tangential to the periphery of the cutter for the teeth
that are engaged in the work. In up milling, this has a tendency to lift the workpart as the
cutter teeth exit the material. In down milling, this cutter force direction is downward,
tending to hold the work against the milling machine table.
Face Milling In face milling, the axis of the cutter is perpendicular to the surface being
milled, and machining is performed by cutting edges on both the end and outside periphery of

FIGURE 22.19 Two

the cutter. As in peripheral milling, various forms of face milling exist, several of which are
shown in Figure 22.20: (a) conventional face milling, in which the diameter of the cutter is
greater than the workpart width, so the cutter overhangs the work on both sides; (b) partial
face milling, where the cutter overhangs the work on only one side; (c) end milling, in
which the cutter diameter is less than the work width, so a slot is cut into the part; (d) profile
milling, a form of end milling in which the outside periphery of a flat part is cut; (e) pocket
milling, another form of end milling used to mill shallow pockets into flat parts; and
(f) surface contouring, in which a ball-nose cutter (rather than square-end cutter) is fed
back and forth across the work along a curvilinear path at close intervals to create a threedimensional surface form. The same basic cutter control is required to machine the
contours of mold and die cavities, in which case the operation is called die sinking.

22.4.2 CUTTING CONDITIONS IN MILLING
The cutting speed is determined at the outside diameter of a milling cutter. This can be
converted to spindle rotation speed using a formula that should now be familiar:
N¼

ð22:13Þ

Thefeedfinmillingisusuallygivenasafeedpercuttertooth;calledthechipload,itrepresentsthe

account the spindle speed and the number of teeth on the cutter as follows:

ð22:14Þ

where fr ¼ feed rate, mm/min (in/min); N ¼ spindle speed, rev/min; nt ¼ number of teeth on
the cutter; and f ¼ chip load in mm/tooth (in/tooth).
Material removal rate in milling is determined using the product of the crosssectional area of the cut and the feed rate. Accordingly, if a slab-milling operation is

This neglects the initial entry of the cutter before full engagement. Eq. (22.15) can be
applied to end milling, side milling, face milling, and other milling operations, making the
proper adjustments in the computation of cross-sectional area of cut.
ThetimerequiredtomillaworkpieceoflengthLmustaccountfortheapproachdistance
required to fully engage the cutter. First, consider the case of slab milling, Figure 22.21. To
determine the time to perform a slab milling operation, the approach distance A to reach full

For face milling, let us consider the two possible cases pictured in Figure 22.22. The first case
is when the cutter is centered over a rectangular workpiece as in Figure 22.22(a). The cutter
feeds from right to left across the workpiece. In order for the cutter to reach the full width of
the work, it must travel an approach distance given by the following:

where D ¼ cutter diameter, mm (in) and w ¼ width of the workpiece, mm (in). If D ¼ w, then
Eq. (22.18) reduces to A ¼ 0.5D. And if D < w, then a slot is cut into the work and A ¼ 0.5D.
The second case is when the cutter is offset to one side of the work, as in Figure 22.22(b).
In this case, the approach distance is given by
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
A ¼ wðD  wÞ
ð22:19Þ
where w ¼ width of the cut, mm (in). In either case, the machining time is given by
Tm ¼

ð22:20Þ

It should be emphasized in all of these milling scenarios that Tm represents the time the
cutter teeth are engaged in the work, making chips. Approach and overtravel distances are
usually added at the beginning and end of each cut to allow access to the work for loading and
unloading. Thus the actual duration of the cutter feed motion is likely to be greater than Tm.

22.4.3 MILLING MACHINES
Milling machines must provide a rotating spindle for the cutter and a table for fastening,
positioning, and feeding the workpart. Various machine tool designs satisfy these requirements. To begin with, milling machines can be classified as horizontal or vertical. A
horizontal milling machine has a horizontal spindle, and this design is well suited for
performing peripheral milling (e.g., slab milling, slotting, side and straddle milling) on
workparts that are roughly cube shaped. A vertical milling machine has a vertical spindle,
and this orientation is appropriate for face milling, end milling, surface contouring, and diesinking on relatively flat workparts.
Other than spindle orientation, milling machines can be classified into the following
types: (1) knee-and-column, (2) bed type, (3) planer type, (4) tracer mills, and (5) CNC
milling machines.
The knee-and-column milling machine is the basic machine tool for milling. It
derives its name from the fact that its two main components are a column that supports
the spindle, and a knee (roughly resembling a human knee) that supports the worktable.
It is available as either a horizontal or a vertical machine, as illustrated in Figure 22.23. In
the horizontal version, an arbor usually supports the cutter. The arbor is basically a shaft
that holds the milling cutter and is driven by the spindle. An overarm is provided on

FIGURE 22.23

Two basic types of knee-and-column milling machine: (a) horizontal and (b) vertical.

horizontal machines to support the arbor. On vertical knee-and-column machines,
milling cutters can be mounted directly in the spindle without an arbor.
One of the features of the knee-and-column milling machine that makes it so
versatile is its capability for worktable feed movement in any of the x–y–z axes. The
worktable can be moved in the x-direction, the saddle can be moved in the y-direction,
and the knee can be moved vertically to achieve the z-movement.
Two special knee-and-column machines should be identified. One is the universal milling machine, Figure 22.24(a), which has a table that can be swiveled in a
horizontal plane (about a vertical axis) to any specified angle. This facilitates the
cutting of angular shapes and helixes on workparts. Another special machine is the
ram mill, Figure 22.24(b), in which the toolhead containing the spindle is located on
the end of a horizontal ram; the ram can be adjusted in and out over the worktable to
locate the cutter relative to the work. The toolhead can also be swiveled to achieve an
angular orientation of the cutter with respect to the work. These features provide
considerable versatility in machining a variety of work shapes.
Bed-type milling machines are designed for high production. They are constructed with greater rigidity than knee-and-column machines, thus permitting them to
achieve heavier feed rates and depths of cut needed for high material removal rates. The
characteristic construction of the bed-type milling machine is shown in Figure 22.25.

Chapter 22/Machining Operations and Machine Tools

The worktable is mounted directly to the bed of the machine tool, rather than using the
less rigid knee-type design. This construction limits the possible motion of the table to
longitudinal feeding of the work past the milling cutter. The cutter is mounted in a
spindle head that can be adjusted vertically along the machine column. Single spindle
bed machines are called simplex mills, as in Figure 22.25, and are available in either
horizontal or vertical models. Duplex mills use two spindle heads. The heads are usually
positioned horizontally on opposite sides of the bed to perform simultaneous operations during one feeding pass of the work. Triplex mills add a third spindle mounted
vertically over the bed to further increase machining capability.
Planer type mills are the largest milling machines. Their general appearance and
construction are those of a large planer (see Figure 22.31); the difference is that milling is
performed instead of planing. Accordingly, one or more milling heads are substituted for the
single-point cutting tools used on planers, and the motion of the work past the tool is a feed
rate motion rather than a cutting speed motion. Planer mills are built to machine very large
parts. The worktable and bed of the machine are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and
the milling heads are supported by a bridge structure that spans across the table.
A tracer mill, also called a profiling mill, is designed to reproduce an irregular part
geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human
operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow the
template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine the desired
shape. Tracer mills are of two types: (1) xy tracing, in which the contour of a flat template
is profile milled using two-axis control; and (2) x–y–z tracing, in which the probe follows a
three-dimensional pattern using three-axis control. Tracer mills have been used for
creating shapes that cannot easily be generated by a simple feeding action of the work
against the milling cutter. Applications include molds and dies. In recent years, many of
these applications have been taken over by CNC milling machines.
Computer numerical control milling machines are milling machines in which the
cutter path is controlled by alphanumerical data rather than a physical template. They are
especially suited to profile milling, pocket milling, surface contouring, and die sinking
operations, in which two or three axes of the worktable must be simultaneously controlled
to achieve the required cutter path. An operator is normally required to change cutters as
well as load and unload workparts.

22.5 MACHINING CENTERS AND TURNING CENTERS
A machining center, illustrated in Figure 22.26, is a highly automated machine tool capable of
performing multiple machining operations under computer numerical control in one setup
with minimal human attention. Workers are needed to load and unload parts, which usually
takes considerable less time than the machine cycle time, so one worker may be able to tend
more than one machine. Typical operations performed on a machining center are milling and
drilling, which use rotating cutting tools.
The typical features that distinguish a machining center from conventional machine
tools and make it so productive include:
å Multiple operations in one setup. Most workparts require more than one operation
to completely machine the specified geometry. Complex parts may require dozens of
distinct machining operations, each requiring its own machine tool, setup, and cutting
tool. Machining centers are capable of performing most or all of the operations at one
location, thus minimizing setup time and production lead time.
å Automatic tool changing. To change from one machining operation to the next, the
cutting tools must be changed. This is done on a machining center under CNC

program control by an automatic tool-changer designed to exchange cutters between
the machine tool spindle and a tool storage carousels. Capacities of these carousels
commonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. The machine in Figure 22.26 has two
storage carousels on the left side of the column.
å Pallet shuttles. Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which are
automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading station, as
shown in Figure 22.26. Parts are fixtured on pallets that are attached to the shuttles. In
this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous part and loading the
next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining the current part. Nonproductive time on the machine is thereby reduced.
å Automatic workpart positioning. Many machining centers have more than three
axes. One of the additional axes is often designed as a rotary table to position the part at
some specified angle relative to the spindle. The rotary table permits the cutter to
perform machining on four sides of the part in a single setup.
Machining centers are classified as horizontal, vertical, or universal. The designation refers to spindle orientation. Horizontal machining centers normally machine cubeshaped parts, in which the four vertical sides of the cube can be accessed by the cutter.
Vertical machining centers are suited to flat parts on which the tool can machine the top
surface. Universal machining centers have workheads that swivel their spindle axes to
any angle between horizontal and vertical, as in Figure 22.26. Our video clip on
machining centers shows several of these machines.

Success of CNC machining centers led to the development of CNC turning centers. A
modern CNC turning center, Figure 22.27, is capable of performing various turning and
related operations, contour turning, and automatic tool indexing, all under computer control.
In addition, the most sophisticated turning centers can accomplish (1) workpart gaging
(checking key dimensions after machining), (2) tool monitoring (sensors to indicate when
the tools are worn), (3) automatic tool changing when tools become worn, and even
(4) automatic workpart changing at the completion of the work cycle [14].
Another type of machine tool related to machining centers and turning centers is the
CNC mill-turn center. This machine has the general configuration of a turning center; in
addition, it can position a cylindrical workpart at a specified angle so that a rotating cutting
tool (e.g., milling cutter) can machine features into the outside surface of the part, as
illustrated in Figure 22.28. An ordinary turning center does not have the capability to
stop the workpart at a defined angular position, and it does not possess rotating tool spindles.
Further progress in machine tool technology has taken the mill-turn center one step
further by integrating additional capabilities into a single machine. The additional capabilities include (1) combining milling, drilling, and turning with grinding, welding, and
inspection operations, all in one machine tool; (2) using multiple spindles simultaneously,
either on a single workpiece or two different workpieces; and (3) automating the part
handling function by adding industrial robots to the machine [2], [20]. The terms
multitasking machine and multifunction machine are sometimes used for these products.

22.6

OTHER MACHINING OPERATIONS
In addition to turning, drilling, and milling, several other machining operations should be
included in our survey: (1) shaping and planing, (2) broaching, and (3) sawing.

22.6.1 SHAPING AND PLANING
Shaping and planing are similar operations, both involving the use of a single-point cutting
tool moved linearly relative to the workpart. In conventional shaping and planing, a
straight, flat surface is created by this action. The difference between the two operations is
illustrated in Figure 22.29. In shaping, the speed motion is accomplished by moving the
cutting tool; while in planing, the speed motion is accomplished by moving the workpart.
Cutting tools used in shaping and planing are single-point tools (Section 23.3.1).
Unlike turning, interrupted cutting occurs in shaping and planing, subjecting the tool to

an impact loading upon entry into the work. In addition, these machine tools are limited
to low speeds due to their start-and-stop motion. The conditions normally dictate use of
high-speed steel cutting tools.
Shaping Shaping is performed on a machine tool called a shaper, Figure 22.30. The
components of the shaper include a ram, which moves relative to a column to provide
the cutting motion, and a worktable that holds the part and accomplishes the feed motion.
The motion of the ram consists of a forward stroke to achieve the cut, and a return stroke
during which the tool is lifted slightly to clear the work and then reset for the next pass. On
completion of each return stroke, the worktable is advanced laterally relative to the ram
motion in order to feed the part. Feed is specified in mm/stroke (in/stroke). The drive
mechanism for the ram can be either hydraulic or mechanical. Hydraulic drive has greater
flexibility in adjusting the stroke length and a more uniform speed during the forward
stroke, but it is more expensive than a mechanical drive unit. Both mechanical and hydraulic
drives are designed to achieve higher speeds on the return (noncutting) stroke than on the
forward (cutting) stroke, thereby increasing the proportion of time spent cutting.
Planing The machine tool for planing is a planer. Cutting speed is achieved by a
reciprocating worktable that moves the part past the single-point cutting tool. The
construction and motion capability of a planer permit much larger parts to be machined
than on a shaper. Planers can be classified as open side planers or double-column planers.
The open-side planer, also known as a single-column planer, Figure 22.31, has a single

column supporting the cross-rail on which a toolhead is mounted. Another toolhead can
also be mounted and fed along the vertical column. Multiple toolheads permit more than
one cut to be taken on each pass. At the completion of each stroke, each toolhead is moved
relative to the cross-rail (or column) to achieve the intermittent feed motion. The
configuration of the open-side planer permits very wide workparts to be machined.
A double-column planer has two columns, one on either side of the base and worktable.
The columns support the cross-rail, on which one or more toolheads are mounted. The two
columns provide a more rigid structure for the operation; however, the two columns limit the
width of the work that can be handled on this machine.
Shaping and planing can be used to machine shapes other than flat surfaces. The
restriction is that the cut surface must be straight. This allows the cutting of grooves, slots,
gear teeth, and other shapes as illustrated in Figure 22.32. Special machines and tool
geometries must be specified to cut some of these shapes. An important example is the gear
shaper, a vertical shaper with a specially designed rotary feed table and synchronized tool
head used to generate teeth on spur gears. Gear shaping and other methods of producing
gears are discussed in Section 22.7.2.

22.6.2 BROACHING
Broaching is performed using a multiple-teeth cutting tool by moving the tool linearly
relative to the work in the direction of the tool axis, as in Figure 22.33. The machine tool is
called a broaching machine, and the cutting tool is called a broach. Aspects of broach
geometry are discussed in Section 23.3.2. In certain jobs for which broaching can be used, it
is a highly productive method of machining. Advantages include good surface finish, close
tolerances, and a variety of work shapes. Owing to the complicated and often customshaped geometry of the broach, tooling is expensive.
There are two principal types of broaching: external (also called surface broaching)
and internal. External broaching is performed on the outside surface of the work to create a
certain cross-sectional shape on the surface. Figure 22.34(a) shows some possible cross
sections that can be formed by external broaching. Internal broaching is accomplished on
the internal surface of a hole in the part. Accordingly, a starting hole must be present in the

part so as to insert the broach at the beginning of the broaching stroke. Figure 22.34(b)
indicates some of the shapes that can be produced by internal broaching.
The basic function of a broaching machine is to provide a precise linear motion of the
tool past a stationary work position, but there are various ways in which this can be done.
Most broaching machines can be classified as either vertical or horizontal machines. The
vertical broaching machine is designed to move the broach along a vertical path, while the
horizontal broaching machine has a horizontal tool trajectory. Most broaching machines pull
the broach past the work. However, there are exceptions to this pull action. One exception is
a relatively simple type called a broaching press, used only for internal broaching, that pushes
the tool through the workpart. Another exception is the continuous broaching machine, in
which the workparts are fixtured to an endless belt loop and moved past a stationary broach.
Because of its continuous operation, this machine can be used only for surface broaching.

22.6.3 SAWING
Sawing is a process in which a narrow slit is cut into the work by a tool consisting of a series
of narrowly spaced teeth. Sawing is normally used to separate a workpart into two pieces, or
to cut off an unwanted portion of a part. These operations are often referred to as cutoff
operations. Since many factories require cutoff operations at some point in the production
sequence, sawing is an important manufacturing process.
In most sawing operations, the work is held stationary and the saw blade is moved
relative to it. Saw blade tooth geometry is discussed in Section 23.3.2. There are three
basic types of sawing, as in Figure 22.35, according to the type of blade motion involved:
(a) hacksawing, (b) bandsawing, and (c) circular sawing.
Hacksawing, Figure 22.35(a), involves a linear reciprocating motion of the saw
against the work. This method of sawing is often used in cutoff operations. Cutting is
accomplished only on the forward stroke of the saw blade. Because of this intermittent
cutting action, hacksawing is inherently less efficient than the other sawing methods, both
of which are continuous. The hacksaw blade is a thin straight tool with cutting teeth on one
edge. Hacksawing can be done either manually or with a power hacksaw. A power hacksaw
provides a drive mechanism to operate the saw blade at a desired speed; it also applies a
given feed rate or sawing pressure.
Bandsawing involves a linear continuous motion, using a bandsaw blade made in the
form of an endless flexible loop with teeth on one edge. The sawing machine is a bandsaw,

which provides a pulley-like drive mechanism to continuously move and guide the bandsaw
blade past the work. Bandsaws are classified as vertical or horizontal. The designation
refers to the direction of saw blade motion during cutting. Vertical bandsaws are used for
cutoff as well as other operations such as contouring and slotting. Contouring on a bandsaw
involves cutting a part profile from flat stock. Slotting is the cutting of a thin slot into a part,
an operation for which bandsawing is well suited. Contour sawing and slotting are
operations in which the work is fed into the saw blade.
Vertical bandsaw machines can be operated either manually, in which the operator
guides and feeds the work past the bandsaw blade, or automatically, in which the work is
power fed past the blade. Recent innovations in bandsaw design have permitted the use of
CNC to perform contouring of complex outlines. Some of the details of the vertical
bandsawing operation are illustrated in Figure 22.35(b). Horizontal bandsaws are normally
used for cutoff operations as alternatives to power hacksaws.
Circular sawing, Figure 22.35(c), uses a rotating saw blade to provide a continuous
motion of the tool past the work. Circular sawing is often used to cut long bars, tubes, and
similar shapes to specified length. The cutting action is similar to a slot milling operation,
except that the saw blade is thinner and contains many more cutting teeth than a slot milling
cutter. Circular sawing machines have powered spindles to rotate the saw blade and a
feeding mechanism to drive the rotating blade into the work.
Two operations related to circular sawing are abrasive cutoff and friction sawing. In
abrasive cutoff, an abrasive disk is used to perform cutoff operations on hard materials
that would be difficult to saw with a conventional saw blade. In friction sawing, a steel
disk is rotated against the work at very high speeds, resulting in friction heat that causes
the material to soften sufficiently to permit penetration of the disk through the work. The
cutting speeds in both of these operations are much faster than in circular sawing.

MACHINING OPERATIONS FOR SPECIAL GEOMETRIES
One of the reasons for the technological importance of machining is its capability to
produce unique geometric features such as screw threads and gear teeth. In this section we
discuss the cutting processes that are used to accomplish these shapes, most of which are
adaptations of machining operations discussed earlier in the chapter.

22.7.1 SCREW THREADS
Threaded hardware components are widely used as fasteners in assembly (screws, bolts,
and nuts, Section 32.1) and for transmission of motion in machinery (e.g., lead screws in
positioning systems, Section 38.3.2). We can define threads as grooves that form a spiral
around the outside of a cylinder (external threads) or the inside of a round hole (internal
threads). We have previously considered the manufacture of threaded components in our
coverage of thread rolling in Section 19.2. Thread rolling is by far the most common
method for producing external threads, but the process is not economical for low
production quantities and the work metal must be ductile. Metallic threaded components
can also be made by casting, especially investment casting and die casting (Sections 11.2.4
and 11.3.3), and plastic parts with threads can be injection molded (Section 13.6). Finally,
threaded components can be machined, and this is the topic we address here. The
discussion is organized into external and internal thread machining.
External Threads The simplest and most versatile method of cutting an external thread
on a cylindrical workpart is single-point threading, which employs a single-point cutting
tool on a lathe. This process is illustrated in Figure 22.6(g). The starting diameter of the
workpiece is equal to the major diameter of the screw thread. The tool must have the profile
of the thread groove, and the lathe must be capable of maintaining the same relationship
between the tool and the workpiece on successive passes in order to cut a consistent spiral.
This relationship is achieved by means of the lathe’s lead screw (see Figure 22.7). More than
one turning pass is usually required. The first pass takes a light cut; the tool is then retracted
and rapidly traversed back to the starting point; and each ensuing pass traces the same spiral
using ever greater depths of cut until the desired form of the thread groove has been
established. Single-point threading is suitable for low or even medium production quantities, but less time-consuming methods are more economical for high production.
An alternative to using a single-point tool is a threading die, shown in Figure 22.36. To
cut an external thread, the die is rotated around the starting cylindrical stock of the proper
diameter, beginning at one end and proceeding to the other end. The cutting teeth at the
opening of the die are tapered so that the starting depth of cut is less at the beginning of
the operation, finally reaching full thread depth at the trailing side of the die. The pitch
of the threading die teeth determines the pitch of the screw that is being cut. The die in
Figure 22.36 has a slit that allows the size of the opening to be adjusted to compensate for
tool wear on the teeth or to provide for minor differences in screw size. Threading dies cut
the threads in a single pass rather than multiple passes as in single-point threading.

Section 22.7/Machining Operations for Special Geometries

Threading dies are typically used in manual operations, in which the die is fixed in a
holder that can be rotated by hand. If the workpiece has a head or other obstacle at the other
end, the die must be unwound from the screw just created in order to remove it. This is not only
time consuming, but it also risks possible damage to the thread surfaces. In mechanized
threading operations, cycle times can be reduced by using self-opening threading dies, which
are designed with an automatic device that opens the cutting teeth at the end of each cut. This
eliminates the need to unwind the die from the work and avoids possible damage to the
threads. Self-opening dies are equipped with four sets of cutting teeth, similar to the threading
die in Figure 22.36, except that the teeth can be adjusted and removed for resharpening, and
the toolholder mechanism possesses the self-opening feature. Different sets of cutting teeth
are required for different thread sizes.
The term thread chasing is often applied to production operations that utilize selfopening dies. Two types of thread chasing equipment are available: (1) stationary selfopening dies, in which the workpiece rotates and the die does not, like a turning operation;
and (2) revolving self-opening dies, in which the die rotates and the workpiece does not,
like a drilling operation.
Two additional external threading operations should be mentioned: thread milling
and thread grinding. Thread milling involves the use of a milling cutter to shape the threads
of a screw. One possible setup is illustrated in Figure 22.37. In this operation a form-milling
cutter, whose profile is that of the thread groove, is oriented at an angle equal to the helix
angle of the thread and fed longitudinally as the workpiece is slowly rotated. In a variation
of this operation, a multiple-form cutter is used, so that multiple screw threads can be cut
simultaneously to increase production rates. Possible reasons for preferring thread milling
over thread chasing include (1) the size of the thread is too large to be readily cut with a die
and (2) thread milling is generally noted to produce more accurate and smoother threads.
Thread grinding is similar to thread milling except the cutter is a grinding wheel with
the shape of the thread groove, and the rotational speed of the grinding wheel is much
greater than in milling. The process can be used to completely form the threads or to finish

threads that have been formed by one of the previously discussed processes. Thread
grinding is especially applicable for threads that have been hardened by heat treatment.
Internal Threads The most common process for cutting internal threads is tapping, in
which a cylindrical tool with cutting teeth arranged in a spiral whose pitch is equal to that of
the screw threads, is simultaneously rotated and fed into a pre-existing hole. The operation is
illustrated in Figure 22.14(b), and the cutting tool is called a tap. The end of the tool is slightly
conical to facilitate entry into the hole. The initial hole size is approximately equal to the
minor diameter of the screw thread. In the simplest version of the process, the tap is a solid
piece and the tapping operation is performed on a drill press equipped with a tapping head,
which allows penetration into the hole at a rate that corresponds to the screw pitch. At the end
of the operation, the spindle rotation is reversed so the tap can be unscrewed from the hole.
In addition to solid taps, collapsible taps are available, just as self-opening dies are
available for external threading. Collapsible taps have cutting teeth that automatically
retract into the tool when the thread has been cut, allowing it to be quickly removed from
the tapped hole without reversing spindle direction. Thus, shorter cycle times are possible.
Although production tapping can be accomplished on drill presses and other
conventional machine tools (e.g., lathes, turret lathes), several types of specialized machines have been developed for higher production rates. Single-spindle tapping machines
perform tapping one workpiece at a time, with manual or automatic loading and unloading
of the starting blanks. Multiple-spindle tapping machines operate on multiple work parts
simultaneously and provide for different hole sizes and screw pitches to be accomplished
together. Finally gang drills (Section 22.3.3) can be set up to perform drilling, reaming, and
tapping in rapid sequence on the same part.

22.7.2 GEARS
Gears are machinery components used to transmit motion and power between rotating
shafts. As illustrated in Figure 22.38, the transmission of rotational motion is achieved

FIGURE 22.38

between meshing gears by teeth located around their respective circumferences. The
teeth have a special curved shape called an involute, which minimizes friction and wear
between contacting teeth of meshing gears. Depending on the relative numbers of teeth
of the two gears, the speed of rotation can be increased or decreased from one gear to the
next, with a corresponding decrease or increase in torque. We examine these speed
effects in our discussion of numerical control positioning systems in Section 38.3.2.
There are various gear types, the most basic and least complicated to produce is the
spur gear represented in Figure 22.38. It has teeth that are parallel to the axis of the gear’s
rotation. A gear with teeth that form an angle relative to the axis of rotation is called a
helical gear. The helical tooth design allows more than one tooth to be in contact for
smoother operation. Spur and helical gears provide rotation between shafts whose axes
are parallel. Other types, such as bevel gears, provide motion between shafts that are at
an angle with each other, usually 90 . A rack is a straight gear (a gear of infinite radius),
which allows rotational motion to be converted into linear motion (e.g., rack-and-pinion
steering on automobiles). The variety of gear types is far too great for us to discuss them
all, and the interested reader is referred to texts on machine design for coverage of gear
design and mechanics. Our interest here is on the manufacture of gears.
Several of the shape processing operations discussed in previous chapters can be
used to produce gears. These include investment casting, die casting, plastic injection
molding, powder metallurgy, forging, and other bulk deformation operations (e.g., gear
rolling, Section 19.2). The advantage of these operations over machining is material
savings because no chips are produced. Sheet-metal stamping operations (Section 20.1)
are used to produce thin gears used in watches and clocks. The gears produced by all of
the preceding operations can often be used without further processing. In other cases, a
basic shape processing operation such as casting or forging is used to produce a starting
metal blank, and these parts are then machined to form the gear teeth. Finishing
operations are often required to achieve the specified accuracies of the teeth dimensions.
The principal machining operations used to cut gear teeth are form milling, gear
hobbing, gear shaping, and gear broaching. Form milling and gear broaching are considered
to be forming operations in the sense of Section 22.1, while gear hobbing and gear shaping
are classified as generating operations. Finishing processes for gear teeth include gear
shaving, gear grinding, and burnishing. The video clip on gears and gear manufacturing
illustrates the various aspects of gear technology. Many of the processes used to make gears
are also used to produce splines, sprockets, and other special machinery components.

(2) gear machining methods.

Form Milling In this process, illustrated in Figure 22.39, the teeth on a gear blank are
machinedindividuallybyaform-millingcutterwhosecuttingedgeshavetheshapeofthespaces
between the teeth on the gear. The machining operation is classified as forming (Section 22.1)
because the shape of the cutter determines the geometry of the gear teeth. The disadvantage of
form milling is that production rates are slow because each tooth space is created one at a time
and the gear blank must be indexed between each pass to establish the correct size of the gear
tooth, which also takes time. The advantage of form milling over gear hobbing (discussed next)
is that the milling cutter is much less expensive. The slow production rates and relatively lowcost tooling make form milling appropriate for low-production quantities.
Gear Hobbing Gear hobbing is also a milling operation, but the cutter, called a hob, is
much more complex and therefore much more expensive than a form milling cutter. In

addition, special milling machines (called hobbing machines) are required to accomplish
the relative speed and feed motions between the cutter and the gear blank. Gear hobbing
is illustrated in Figure 22.40. As shown in the figure, the hob has a slight helix and its
rotation must be coordinated with the much slower rotation of the gear blank in order for
the hob’s cutting teeth to mesh with the blank’s teeth as they are being cut. This is
accomplished for a spur gear by offsetting the axis of rotation of the hob by an amount
equal to 90 less the helix angle relative to the axis of the gear blank. In addition to these
rotary motions of the hob and the workpiece, a straight-line motion is also required to
feed the hob relative to the gear blank throughout its thickness. Several teeth are cut
simultaneously in hobbing, which allows for higher production rates than form milling.
Accordingly, it is a widely used gear making process for medium and high production
quantities.
Gear Shaping In gear shaping, a reciprocating cutting tool motion is used rather than a
rotational motion as in form milling and gear hobbing. Two quite different forms of
shaping operation (Section 22.6.1) are used to produce gears. In the first type, a singlepoint tool takes multiple passes to gradually shape each tooth profile using computerized
controls or a template. The gear blank is slowly rotated or indexed, with the same profile
being imparted to each tooth. The procedure is slow and applied only in the fabrication of
very large gears.
In the second type of gear shaping operation, the cutter has the general shape of a
gear, with cutting teeth on one side. The axes of the cutter and the gear blank are parallel,
as illustrated in Figure 22.41, and the action is similar to a pair of conjugate gears except

that the reciprocation of the cutter is gradually creating the form of the matching teeth in
its mating component. At the beginning of the operation for a given gear blank, the cutter
is fed into the blank after each stroke until the required depth has been reached. Then,
after each successive pass of the tool, both the cutter and the blank are rotated a small
amount (indexed) so as to maintain the same tooth spacing on each. Gear shaping by this
second method is widely used in industry, and specialized machines (called gear shapers)
are available to accomplish the process.
Gear Broaching Broaching (Section 22.6.2) as a gear making process is noted for short
production cycle times and high tooling cost. It is therefore economical only for high
volumes. Good dimensional accuracy and fine surface finish are also features of gear
broaching. The process can be applied for both external gears (the conventional gear)
and internal gears (teeth on the inside of the gear). For making internal gears, the
operation is similar to that shown in Figure 22.3(c), except the cross section of the tool
consists of a series of gear-shaped cutting teeth of increasing size to form the gear teeth in
successive steps as the broach is drawn through the work blank. To produce external
gears, the broach is tubular with inward-facing teeth. As mentioned, the cost of tooling in
both cases is high due to the complex geometry.
Finishing Operations Some metal gears can be used without heat treatment, while
those used in more demanding applications are usually heat treated to harden the teeth
for maximum wear resistance. Unfortunately, heat treatment (Chapter 27) often results
in warpage of the workpiece, and the proper gear-tooth shape must be restored. Whether
heat treated or not, some type of finishing operation is generally required to improve
dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the gear after machining. Finishing processes
applied to gears that have not been heat treated include shaving and burnishing.
Finishing processes applied to hardened gears include grinding, lapping, and honing
(Chapter 25).
Gear shaving involves the use of a gear-shaped cutter that is meshed and rotated
with the gear. Cutting action results from reciprocation of the cutter during rotation.
Each tooth of the gear-shaped cutter has multiple cutting edges along its width, producing
very small chips and removing very little metal from the surface of each gear tooth. Gear
shaping is probably the most common industrial process for finishing gears. It is often
applied to a gear prior to heat treatment, and then followed by grinding and/or lapping
after heat treatment.
Gear burnishing is a plastic deformation process in which one or more hardened
gear-shaped dies are rolled in contact with the gear, and pressure is applied by the dies to
effect cold working of the gear teeth. Thus, the teeth are strengthened through strain
hardening, and surface finish is improved.
Grinding, honing, and lapping are three finishing processes that can be used on
hardened gears. Gear grinding can be based on either of two methods. The first is form
grinding, in which the grinding wheel has the exact shape of the tooth spacing (similar to
form milling), and a grinding pass or series of passes are made to finish form each tooth in
the gear. The other method involves generating the tooth profile using a conventional
straight-sided grinding wheel. Both of these grinding methods are very time consuming
and expensive.
Honing and lapping, discussed in Section 25.2.1 and 25.2.2, respectively, are two
finishing processes that can be adapted to gear finishing using very fine abrasives. The tools
in both processes usually possess the geometry of a gear that meshes with the gear to be
processed. Gear honing uses a tool that is made of either plastic impregnated with abrasives
or steel coated with carbide. Gear lapping uses a cast iron tool (other metals are sometimes
substituted), and the cutting action is accomplished by the lapping compound containing
abrasives.

Section 22.8/High-Speed Machining

22.8

HIGH-SPEED MACHINING
One persistent trend throughout the history of metal machining has been the use of higher
and higher cutting speeds. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in this area due to
its potential for faster production rates, shorter lead times, reduced costs, and improved part
quality. In its simplest definition, high-speed machining (HSM) means using cutting speeds
that are significantly higher than those used in conventional machining operations. Some
examples of cutting speed values for conventional and HSM are presented in Table 22.1,
according to data compiled by Kennametal Inc.1
Other definitions of HSM have been developed to deal with the wide variety of
work materials and tool materials used in machining. One popular HSM definition is the
DN ratio—the bearing bore diameter (mm) multiplied by the maximum spindle speed
(rev/min). For high-speed machining, the typical DN ratio is between 500,000 and
1,000,000. This definition allows larger diameter bearings to fall within the HSM range,
even though they operate at lower rotational speeds than smaller bearings. Typical HSM
spindle velocities range between 8000 and 35,000 rpm, although some spindles today are
designed to rotate at 100,000 rpm.
Another HSM definition is based on the ratio of horsepower to maximum spindle
speed, or hp/rpm ratio. Conventional machine tools usually have a higher hp/rpm ratio
than machines equipped for high-speed machining. By this metric, the dividing line
between conventional machining and HSM is around 0.005 hp/rpm. Thus, high-speed
machining includes 50 hp spindles capable of 10,000 rpm (0.005 hp/rpm) and 15 hp
spindles that can rotate at 30,000 rpm (0.0005 hp/rpm).
Other definitions emphasize higher production rates and shorter lead times, rather
than functions of spindle speed. In this case, important noncutting factors come into play,
such as high rapid traverse speeds and quick automatic tool changes (‘‘chip-to-chip’’ times
of 7 sec and less).
Requirements for high-speed machining include the following: (1) high-speed spindles using special bearings designed for high rpm operation; (2) high feed rate capability,
typically around 50 m/min (2000 in/min); (3) CNC motion controls with ‘‘look-ahead’’

features that allow the controller to see upcoming directional changes and to make
adjustments to avoid undershooting or overshooting the desired tool path; (4) balanced
cutting tools, toolholders, and spindles to minimize vibration effects; (5) coolant delivery
systems that provide pressures an order of magnitude greater than in conventional
machining; and (6) chip control and removal systems to cope with the much larger metal
removal rates in HSM. Also important are the cutting tool materials. As listed in Table 22.1,
various tool materials are used for high-speed machining, and these materials are discussed
in the following chapter.
Applications of HSM seem to divide into three categories [3]. One is in the aircraft
industry, by companies such as Boeing, in which long airframe structural components are
machined from large aluminum blocks. Much metal removal is required, mostly by
milling. The resulting pieces are characterized by thin walls and large surface-to-volume
ratios, but they can be produced more quickly and are more reliable than assemblies
involving multiple components and riveted joints. A second category involves the
machining of aluminum by multiple operations to produce a variety of components
for industries such as automotive, computer, and medical. Multiple cutting operations
mean many tool changes as well as many accelerations and decelerations of the tooling.
Thus, quick tool changes and tool path control are important in these applications. The
third application category for HSM is in the die and mold industry, which fabricates
complex geometries from hard materials. In this case, high-speed machining involves
much metal removal to create the mold or die cavity and finishing operations to achieve
fine surface finishes.

PROBLEMS
Turning and Related Operations
22.1. A cylindrical workpart 200 mm in diameter and
700 mm long is to be turned in an engine lathe.
Cutting speed ¼ 2.30 m/s, feed ¼ 0.32 mm/rev, and
depth of cut ¼ 1.80 mm. Determine (a) cutting
time, and (b) metal removal rate.
22.2. In a production turning operation, the foreman has
decreed that a single pass must be completed on
the cylindrical workpiece in 5.0 min. The piece is
400 mm long and 150 mm in diameter. Using a
feed ¼ 0.30 mm/rev and a depth of cut ¼ 4.0 mm,
what cutting speed must be used to meet this
machining time requirement?
22.3. A facing operation is performed on an engine lathe.
The diameter of the cylindrical part is 6 in and the
length is 15 in. The spindle rotates at a speed of 180
rev/min. Depth of cut ¼ 0.110 in, and feed ¼ 0.008 in/
rev. Assume the cutting tool moves from the outer
diameter of the workpiece to exactly the center at a
constant velocity. Determine (a) the velocity of the
tool as it moves from the outer diameter towards
the center and (b) the cutting time.
22.4. A tapered surface is to be turned on an automatic
lathe. The workpiece is 750 mm long with minimum
and maximum diameters of 100 mm and 200 mm at
opposite ends. The automatic controls on the lathe
permit the surface speed to be maintained at a
constant value of 200 m/min by adjusting the rotational speed as a function of workpiece diameter.
Feed ¼ 0.25 mm/rev and depth of cut ¼ 3.0 mm.
The rough geometry of the piece has already been
formed, and this operation will be the final cut.

Determine (a) the time required to turn the taper
and (b) the rotational speeds at the beginning and
end of the cut.
22.5. In the taper turning job of Problem 22.4, suppose
that the automatic lathe with surface speed control
is not available and a conventional lathe must be
used. Determine the rotational speed that would be
required to complete the job in exactly the same
time as your answer to part (a) of that problem.
22.6. A cylindrical work bar with 4.5 in diameter and 52 in
length is chucked in an engine lathe and supported at
the opposite end using a live center. A 46.0-in
portion of the length is to be turned to a diameter
of 4.25 in one pass at a speed of 450 ft/min. The metal
removal rate should be 6.75 in3/min. Determine
(a) the required depth of cut, (b) the required
feed, and (c) the cutting time.
22.7. A 4.00-in-diameter workpiece that is 25 in long is to
be turned down to a diameter of 3.50 in, using two
passes on an engine lathe using a cutting speed ¼
300 ft/min, feed ¼ 0.015 in/rev, and depth of cut ¼
0.125 in. The bar will be held in a chuck and
supported on the opposite end in a live center.
With this workholding setup, one end must be
turned to diameter; then the bar must be reversed
to turn the other end. Using an overhead crane
available at the lathe, the time required to load and
unload the bar is 5 min, and the time to reverse the
bar is 3 min. For each turning cut an allowance
must be added to the cut length for approach and
overtravel. The total allowance (approach plus

E1C22

Page 549

Problems
overtravel) ¼ 0.50 in. Determine the total cycle
time to complete this turning operation.
22.8. The end of a large tubular workpart is to be faced
on a CNC vertical boring mill. The part has an
outside diameter of 38.0 in and an inside diameter
of 24.0 in. If the facing operation is performed at a
rotational speed of 40.0 rev/min, feed of 0.015 in/
rev, and depth of cut of 0.180 in, determine (a) the
cutting time to complete the facing operation and

549

the cutting speeds and metal removal rates at the
beginning and end of the cut.
22.9. Solve Problem 22.8 except that the machine tool
controls operate at a constant cutting speed by
continuously adjusting rotational speed for the
position of the tool relative to the axis of rotation.
The rotational speed at the beginning of the cut ¼
40 rev/min, and is continuously increased thereafter to maintain a constant cutting speed.

Drilling
22.10. A drilling operation is to be performed with a
12.7-mm diameter twist drill in a steel workpart.
The hole is a blind hole at a depth of 60 mm and the
point angle is 118 . The cutting speed is 25 m/min
and the feed is 0.30 mm/rev. Determine (a) the
cutting time to complete the drilling operation, and
(b) metal removal rate during the operation, after
the drill bit reaches full diameter.
22.11. A two-spindle drill simultaneously drills a 1/2 in
hole and a 3/4 in hole through a workpiece that is
1.0 in thick. Both drills are twist drills with point
angles of 118 . Cutting speed for the material is 230
ft/min. The rotational speed of each spindle can be
set individually. The feed rate for both holes must
be set to the same value because the two spindles
lower at the same rate. The feed rate is set so the
total metal removal rate does not exceed 1.50 in3/
min. Determine (a) the maximum feed rate (in/
min) that can be used, (b) the individual feeds (in/
rev) that result for each hole, and (c) the time
required to drill the holes.
22.12. A CNC drill press is to perform a series of throughhole drilling operations on a 1.75-in thick aluminum plate that is a component in a heat exchanger.
Each hole is 3/4 in diameter. There are 100 holes in

all, arranged in a 10  10 matrix pattern, and the
distance between adjacent hole centers (along the
square) ¼ 1.5 in. The cutting speed ¼ 300 ft/min,
the penetration feed (z-direction) ¼ 0.015 in/rev,
and the traverse rate between holes (x-y plane) ¼
15.0 in/min. Assume that x-y moves are made at a
distance of 0.50 in above the work surface, and that
this distance must be included in the penetration
feed rate for each hole. Also, the rate at which the
drill is retracted from each hole is twice the penetration feed rate. The drill has a point angle ¼ 100 .
Determine the time required from the beginning of
the first hole to the completion of the last hole,
assuming the most efficient drilling sequence will
be used to accomplish the job.
22.13. A gun-drilling operation is used to drill a 9/64in diameter hole to a certain depth. It takes
4.5 minutes to perform the drilling operation using
high pressure fluid delivery of coolant to the drill
point. The current spindle speed ¼ 4000 rev/min,
and feed ¼ 0.0017 in/rev. In order to improve the
surface finish in the hole, it has been decided to
increase the speed by 20% and decrease the feed
by 25%. How long will it take to perform the
operation at the new cutting conditions?

(b) the maximum metal removal rate during
cutting.
22.16. A slab milling operation is performed on the top
surface of a steel rectangular workpiece 12.0 in

the cutter radius plus 0.5 in, what is the duration of
the feed motion.
22.17. A face milling operation is performed on the top
surface of a steel rectangular workpiece 12.0 in
long by 2.5 in wide. The milling cutter follows a
path that is centered over the workpiece. It has five
teeth and a 3.0 in diameter. Cutting speed ¼ 250 ft/

22.18. Solve Problem 22.17 except that the workpiece is
5.0 in wide and the cutter is offset to one side so
that the swath cut by the cutter ¼ 1.0 in wide. This is
called partial face milling, Figure 22.20(b).
22.19. A face milling operation removes 0.32 in depth of
cut from the end of a cylinder that has a diameter of

3.90 in. The cutter has a 4-in diameter with 4 teeth,

time), and (c) the maximum metal removal rate.
22.20. The top surface of a rectangular workpart is machined using a peripheral milling operation. The
workpart is 735 mm long by 50 mm wide by 95 mm

finished. (b) What is the maximum material removal rate during the cut?

Machining and Turning Centers
22.21. A three-axis CNC machining center is tended by a
worker who loads and unloads parts between
machining cycles. The machining cycle takes
5.75 min, and the worker takes 2.80 min using a
hoist to unload the part just completed and load
and fixture the next part onto the machine worktable. A proposal has been made to install a twoposition pallet shuttle at the machine so that the
worker and the machine tool can perform their
respective tasks simultaneously rather than sequentially. The pallet shuttle would transfer the
parts between the machine worktable and the load/
unload station in 15 sec. Determine (a) the current
cycle time for the operation and (b) the cycle time
if the proposal is implemented. What is the percentage increase in hourly production rate that
would result from using the pallet shuttle?
22.22. A part is produced using six conventional machine
tools consisting of three milling machines and three
drill presses. The machine cycle times on these
machines are 4.7 min, 2.3 min, 0.8 min, 0.9 min,
3.4 min, and 0.5 min. The average load/unload time
for each of these operations is 1.25 min. The
corresponding setup times for the six machines
are 1.55 hr, 2.82 hr, 57 min, 45 min, 3.15 hr, and
36 min, respectively. The total material handling
time to carry one part between the machines is
20 min (consisting of five moves between six machines). A CNC machining center has been

installed, and all six operations will be performed
on it to produce the part. The setup time for the
machining center for this job is 1.0 hr. In addition,
the machine must be programmed for this part
(called ‘‘part programming’’), which takes 3.0 hr.
The machine cycle time is the sum of the machine
cycle times for the six machines. Load/unload time
is 1.25 min. (a) What is the total time to produce
one of these parts using the six conventional machines if the total consists of all setups, machine
cycle times, load/unload times, and part transfer
times between machines? (b) What is the total time
to produce one of these parts using the CNC
machining center if the total consists of the setup
time, programming time, machine cycle time, and
load/unload time, and what are the percent savings
in total time compared to your answer in (a)? (c) If
the same part is produced in a batch of 20 pieces,
what is the total time to produce them under the
same conditions as in (a) except that the total
material handling time to carry the 20 parts in
one unit load between the machines is 40 min?
(d) If the part is produced in a batch of 20 pieces on
the CNC machining center, what is the total time to
produce them under the same conditions as in part
(b), and what are the percent savings in total time
compared to your answer in (c)? (e) In future
orders of 20 pieces of the same part, the programming time will not be included in the total time

because the part program has already been prepared and saved. In this case, how long does it take
to produce the 20 parts using the machining center,

551

and what are the percent savings in total time
compared to your answer in (c)?

Other Operations
22.23. A shaper is used to reduce the thickness of a 50 mm
part to 45 mm. The part is made of cast iron and has
a tensile strength of 270 MPa and a Brinell hardness of 165 HB. The starting dimensions of the part
are 750 mm  450 mm  50 mm. The cutting speed
is 0.125 m/sec and the feed is 0.40 mm/pass. The
shaper ram is hydraulically driven and has a return
stroke time that is 50% of the cutting stroke time.
An extra 150 mm must be added before and after
the part for acceleration and deceleration to take
place. Assuming the ram moves parallel to the long
dimension of the part, how long will it take to
machine?
22.24. An open side planer is to be used to plane the top
surface of a rectangular workpart, 20.0 in  45.0 in.
The cutting speed is 30 ft/min, the feed is 0.015 in/
pass, and the depth of cut is 0.250 in. The length of
the stroke across the work must be set up so that

10 in are allowed at both the beginning and end of
the stroke for approach and overtravel. The return
stroke, including an allowance for acceleration and
deceleration, takes 60% of the time for the forward
stroke. The workpart is made of carbon steel with a
tensile strength of 50,000 lb/in2 and a Brinell hardness of 110 HB. How long will it take to complete
the job, assuming that the part is oriented in such a
way as to minimize the time?
22.25. High-speed machining is being considered to produce the aluminum part in Problem 22.15. All
cutting conditions remain the same except for
the cutting speed and the type of insert used in
the cutter. Assume the cutting speed will be at the
limit given in Table 22.1. Determine (a) the new
time to machine the part and (b) the new metal
removal rate. (c) Is this part a good candidate for
high-speed machining? Explain.

23.4.1 Types of Cutting Fluids
23.4.2 Application of Cutting Fluids

Machining operations are accomplished using cutting tools.
The high forces and temperatures during machining create
a very harsh environment for the tool. If cutting force
becomes too high, the tool fractures. If cutting temperature
becomes too high, the tool material softens and fails. If
neither of these conditions causes the tool to fail, continual
wear of the cutting edge ultimately leads to failure.
Cutting tool technology has two principal aspects: tool
material and tool geometry. The first is concerned with developing materials that can withstand the forces, temperatures,
and wearing action in the machining process. The second deals
with optimizing the geometry of the cutting tool for the tool
material and for a given operation. These are the issues we
address in the present chapter. It is appropriate to begin by
considering tool life, because this is a prerequisite for much of
our subsequent discussion on tool materials. It also seems
appropriate to include a section on cutting fluids at the end of
this chapter; cutting fluids are often used in machining operations to prolong the life of a cutting tool. In the DVD included
with this book is a video clip on Cutting-Tool Materials.
VIDEO CLIP
Cutting-Tool Materials. This clip has three segments:
(1) cutting-tool materials, which includes an overview of
the different cutting-tool categories; (2) tool material quality trade-offs; and (3) tool failure modes.

23.1

TOOL LIFE

As suggested by our opening paragraph, there are three
possible modes by which a cutting tool can fail in machining:
1. Fracture failure. This mode of failure occurs when the
cutting force at the tool point becomes excessive, causing it to fail suddenly by brittle fracture.
552

E1C23

16:40:51

Page 553

Section 23.1/Tool Life

553

2. Temperature failure. This failure occurs when the cutting temperature is too high for
the tool material, causing the material at the tool point to soften, which leads to plastic
deformation and loss of the sharp edge.
3. Gradual wear. Gradual wearing of the cutting edge causes loss of tool shape,
reduction in cutting efficiency, an acceleration of wearing as the tool becomes heavily
worn, and finally tool failure in a manner similar to a temperature failure.
Fracture and temperature failures result in premature loss of the cutting tool. These
two modes of failure are therefore undesirable. Of the three possible tool failures,
gradual wear is preferred because it leads to the longest possible use of the tool, with the
associated economic advantage of that longer use.
Product quality must also be considered when attempting to control the mode of
tool failure. When the tool point fails suddenly during a cut, it often causes damage to the
work surface. This damage requires either rework of the surface or possible scrapping of
the part. The damage can be avoided by selecting cutting conditions that favor gradual
wearing of the tool rather than fracture or temperature failure, and by changing the tool
before the final catastrophic loss of the cutting edge occurs.

23.1.1 TOOL WEAR
Gradual wear occurs at two principal locations on a cutting tool: the top rake face and the
flank. Accordingly, two main types of tool wear can be distinguished: crater wear and
flank wear, illustrated in Figures 23.1 and 23.2. We will use a single-point tool to explain
tool wear and the mechanisms that cause it. Crater wear, Figure 23.2(a), consists of a
cavity in the rake face of the tool that forms and grows from the action of the chip sliding
against the surface. High stresses and temperatures characterize the tool–chip contact
interface, contributing to the wearing action. The crater can be measured either by its
depth or its area. Flank wear, Figure 23.2(b), occurs on the flank, or relief face, of the
tool. It results from rubbing between the newly generated work surface and the flank face
adjacent to the cutting edge. Flank wear is measured by the width of the wear band, FW.
This wear band is sometimes called the flank wear land.
Certain features of flank wear can be identified. First, an extreme condition of flank
wear often appears on the cutting edge at the location corresponding to the original surface
of the workpart. This is called notch wear. It occurs because the original work surface is
harder and/or more abrasive than the internal material, which could be caused by work

hardening from cold drawing or previous machining, sand particles in the surface from
casting, or other reasons. As a consequence of the harder surface, wear is accelerated at this
location. A second region of flank wear that can be identified is nose radius wear; this
occurs on the nose radius leading into the end cutting edge.
The mechanisms that cause wear at the tool–chip and tool–work interfaces in
machining can be summarized as follows:
å Abrasion. This is a mechanical wearing action caused by hard particles in the work
material gouging and removing small portions of the tool. This abrasive action
occurs in both flank wear and crater wear; it is a significant cause of flank wear.
å Adhesion. When two metals are forced into contact under high pressure and temperature, adhesion or welding occur between them. These conditions are present between the

chip and the rake face of the tool. As the chip flows across the tool, small particles of the
tool are broken away from the surface, resulting in attrition of the surface.
å Diffusion. This is a process in which an exchange of atoms takes place across a close
contact boundary between two materials (Section 4.3). In the case of tool wear,
diffusion occurs at the tool–chip boundary, causing the tool surface to become
depleted of the atoms responsible for its hardness. As this process continues, the
tool surface becomes more susceptible to abrasion and adhesion. Diffusion is
believed to be a principal mechanism of crater wear.
å Chemical reactions. The high temperatures and clean surfaces at the tool–chip
interface in machining at high speeds can result in chemical reactions, in particular,
oxidation, on the rake face of the tool. The oxidized layer, being softer than the
parent tool material, is sheared away, exposing new material to sustain the reaction
process.
å Plastic deformation. Another mechanism that contributes to tool wear is plastic
deformation of the cutting edge. The cutting forces acting on the cutting edge at
high temperature cause the edge to deform plastically, making it more vulnerable to
abrasion of the tool surface. Plastic deformation contributes mainly to flank wear.
Most of these tool-wear mechanisms are accelerated at higher cutting speeds and
temperatures. Diffusion and chemical reaction are especially sensitive to elevated
temperature.

23.1.2 TOOL LIFE AND THE TAYLOR TOOL LIFE EQUATION
As cutting proceeds, the various wear mechanisms result in increasing levels of wear on
the cutting tool. The general relationship of tool wear versus cutting time is shown in
Figure 23.3. Although the relationship shown is for flank wear, a similar relationship occurs
for crater wear. Three regions can usually be identified in the typical wear growth curve. The
first is the break-in period, in which the sharp cutting edge wears rapidly at the beginning of
its use. This first region occurs within the first few minutes of cutting. The break-in period is
followed by wear that occurs at a fairly uniform rate. This is called the steady-state wear
region. In our figure, this region is pictured as a linear function of time, although there are
deviations from the straight line in actual machining. Finally, wear reaches a level at which
the wear rate begins to accelerate. This marks the beginning of the failure region, in which
cutting temperatures are higher, and the general efficiency of the machining process is
reduced. If allowed to continue, the tool finally fails by temperature failure.

Time of cutting (min)

The slope of the tool wear curve in the steady-state region is affected by work
material and cutting conditions. Harder work materials cause the wear rate (slope of the
tool wear curve) to increase. Increased speed, feed, and depth of cut have a similar effect,
with speed being the most important of the three. If the tool wear curves are plotted for
several different cutting speeds, the results appear as in Figure 23.4. As cutting speed is
increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time.
Tool life is defined as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operating
the tool until final catastrophic failure is one way of defining tool life. This is indicated in
Figure 23.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it is often a
disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of difficulties in resharpening
the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative, a level of tool wear can
be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced when wear reaches that level. A
convenient tool life criterion is a certain flank wear value, such as 0.5 mm (0.020 in),
illustrated as the horizontal line on the graph. When each of the three wear curves intersects
that line, the life of the corresponding tool is defined as ended. If the intersection points are
projected down to the time axis, the values of tool life can be identified, as we have done.
Taylor Tool Life Equation If the tool life values for the three wear curves in Figure 23.4
are plotted on a natural log–log graph of cutting speed versus tool life, the resulting
relationship is a straight line as shown in Figure 23.5.1
The discovery of this relationship around 1900 is credited to F. W. Taylor. It can be
expressed in equation form and is called the Taylor tool life equation:
vT n ¼ C

ð23:1Þ

where v ¼ cutting speed, m/min (ft/min); T ¼ tool life, min; and n and C are
parameters whose values depend on feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling
(material in particular), and the tool life criterion used.
The value of n is relative constant for a given tool material, whereas the value of C
depends on tool material, work material, and cutting conditions. We will elaborate on
these relationships when we discuss the various tool materials in Section 23.2.

The reader may have noted in Figure 23.5 that we have plotted the dependent variable (tool life) on the
horizontal axis and the independent variable (cutting speed) on the vertical axis. Although this is a reversal
of the normal plotting convention, it nevertheless is the way the Taylor tool life relationship is usually
presented.

Tool life (min)

Basically, Eq. (23.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool lives.
Relating the parameters n and C to Figure 23.5, n is the slope of the plot (expressed in
linear terms rather than in the scale of the axes), and C is the intercept on the speed axis.
C represents the cutting speed that results in a 1-min tool life.
The problem with Eq. (23.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the equation
are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units consistent, the
equation should be expressed in the form

vT n ¼ C T ref n
ð23:2Þ

where Tref ¼ a reference value for C. Tref is simply 1 min when m/min (ft/min) and
minutes are used for v and T, respectively.
The advantage of Eq. (23.2) is seen when it is desired to use the Taylor equation
with units other than m/min (ft/min) and minutes—for example, if cutting speed were
expressed as m/sec and tool life as sec. In this case, Tref would be 60 sec and C would
therefore be the same speed value as in Eq. (23.1), although converted to units of m/sec.
The slope n would have the same numerical value as in Eq. (23.1).

Example 23.1
Taylor Tool Life
Equation

Determine the values of C and n in the plot of Figure 23.5, using two of the three points on
the curve and solving simultaneous equations of the form of Eq. (23.1).

Solution: Choosing the two extreme points: v ¼ 160 m/min, T ¼ 5 min; and v ¼ 100 m/min,
T ¼ 41 min; we have
160ð5Þn ¼ C
100ð41Þn ¼ C
Setting the left-hand sides of each equation equal,
160ð5Þn ¼ 100ð41Þn
Taking the natural logarithms of each term,
lnð160Þ þ n lnð5Þ ¼ lnð100Þ þ n lnð41Þ
5:0752 þ 1:6094 n ¼ 4:6052 þ 3:7136 n

Substituting this value of n into either starting equation, we obtain the value of C:
C ¼ 160ð5Þ0:223 ¼ 229

or
C ¼ 100ð41Þ0:223 ¼ 229

The Taylor tool life equation for the data of Figure 23.5 is therefore
vT 0:223 ¼ 229

n

An expanded version of Eq. (23.2) can be formulated to include the effects of feed,
depth of cut, and even work material hardness:
vT n f m dp H p ¼ KT ref n f ref m dref p H ref q

ð23:3Þ

where f ¼ feed, mm (in); d ¼ depth of cut, mm (in); H ¼ hardness, expressed in an
appropriate hardness scale; m, p, and q are exponents whose values are experimentally
determined for the conditions of the operation; K ¼ a constant analogous to C in Eq.
(23.2); and fref, dref, and Href are reference values for feed, depth of cut, and hardness.
The values of m and p, the exponents for feed and depth, are less than 1.0. This
indicates the greater effect of cutting speed on tool life, because the exponent of v is 1.0.
After speed, feed is next in importance, so m has a value greater than p. The exponent for
work hardness, q, is also less than 1.0.
Perhaps the greatest difficulty in applying Eq. (23.3) in a practical machining
operation is the tremendous amount of machining data that would be required to
determine the parameters of the equation. Variations in work materials and testing
conditions also cause difficulties by introducing statistical variations in the data. Equation (23.3) is valid in indicating general trends among its variables, but not in its ability to
accurately predict tool life performance. To reduce these problems and make the scope of
the equation more manageable, some of the terms are usually eliminated. For example,
omitting depth and hardness reduces Eq. (23.3) to the following:
vT n f m ¼ KT ref n f ref m

ð23:4Þ

where the terms have the same meaning as before, except that the constant K will
have a slightly different interpretation.
Tool Life Criteria in Production Although flank wear is the tool life criterion in our
previous discussion of the Taylor equation, this criterion is not very practical in a factory
environment because of the difficulties and time required to measure flank wear.
Following are nine alternative tool life criteria that are more convenient to use in a
production machining operation, some of which are admittedly subjective:
1. Complete failure of the cutting edge (fracture failure, temperature failure, or wearing
until complete breakdown of the tool has occurred). This criterion has disadvantages,
as discussed earlier.
2. Visual inspection of flank wear (or crater wear) by the machine operator (without a
toolmaker’s microscope). This criterion is limited by the operator’s judgment and
ability to observe tool wear with the naked eye.
3. Fingernail test across the cutting edge by the operator to test for irregularities.
4. Changes in the sound emitting from the operation, as judged by the operator.
5. Chips become ribbony, stringy, and difficult to dispose of.

6. Degradation of the surface finish on the work.
7. Increased power consumption in the operation, as measured by a wattmeter connected to the machine tool.
8. Workpiece count. The operator is instructed to change the tool after a certain specified
number of parts have been machined.
9. Cumulative cutting time. This is similar to the previous workpiece count, except that
the length of time the tool has been cutting is monitored. This is possible on machine
tools controlled by computer; the computer is programmed to keep data on the total
cutting time for each tool.

23.2

TOOL MATERIALS
The three modes of tool failure allow us to identify three important properties required in
a tool material:
å Toughness. To avoid fracture failure, the tool material must possess high toughness.
Toughness is the capacity of a material to absorb energy without failing. It is usually
characterized by a combination of strength and ductility in the material.
å Hot hardness. Hot hardness is the ability of a material to retain its hardness at high
temperatures. This is required because of the high-temperature environment in
which the tool operates.
å Wear resistance. Hardness is the single most important property needed to resist
abrasive wear. All cutting-tool materials must be hard. However, wear resistance in
metal cutting depends on more than just tool hardness, because of the other tool-wear
mechanisms. Other characteristics affecting wear resistance include surface finish on
the tool (a smoother surface means a lower coefficient of friction), chemistry of tool
and work materials, and whether a cutting fluid is used.
Cutting-tool materials achieve this combination of properties in varying degrees. In this section, the following cutting-tool materials are discussed: (1) high-speed
steel and its predecessors, plain carbon and low alloy steels; (2) cast cobalt alloys;
(3) cemented carbides, cermets, and coated carbides; (4) ceramics; (5) synthetic diamond
and cubic boron nitride. Before examining these individual materials, a brief overview
and technical comparison will be helpful. The historical development of these materials
is described in Historical Note 23.1. Commercially, the most important tool materials
are high-speed steel and cemented carbides, cermets, and coated carbides. These two
categories account for more than 90% of the cutting tools used in machining operations.
Table 23.1 and Figure 23.6 present data on properties of various tool materials. The
properties are those related to the requirements of a cutting tool: hardness, toughness, and
hot hardness. Table 23.1 lists room temperature hardness and transverse rupture strength for
selected materials. Transverse rupture strength (Section 3.1.3) is a property used to indicate
toughness for hard materials. Figure 23.6 shows hardness as a function of temperature for
several of the tool materials discussed in this section.
In addition to these property comparisons, it is useful to compare the materials in
terms of the parameters n and C in the Taylor tool life equation. In general, the
development of new cutting-tool materials has resulted in increases in the values of
these two parameters. Table 23.2 provides a listing of representative values of n and C in
the Taylor tool life equation for selected cutting-tool materials.
The chronological development of tool materials has generally followed a path in
which new materials have permitted higher and higher cutting speeds to be achieved.

Historical Note 23.1

Cutting-tool materials

I

n 1800, England was leading the Industrial Revolution,
and iron was the leading metal in the revolution. The
best tools for cutting iron were made of cast steel by the
crucible process, invented in 1742 by B. Huntsman. Cast
steel, whose carbon content lies between wrought iron
and cast iron, could be hardened by heat treatment to
machine the other metals. In 1868, R. Mushet discovered
that by alloying about 7% tungsten in crucible steel, a
hardened tool steel was obtained by air quenching after
heat treatment. Mushet’s tool steel was far superior to its
predecessor in machining.
Frederick W. Taylor stands as an important figure in the
history of cutting tools. Starting around 1880 at Midvale
Steel in Philadelphia and later at Bethlehem Steel in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, he began a series of experiments
that lasted a quarter century, yielding a much improved
understanding of the metal-cutting process. Among the
developments resulting from the work of Taylor and
colleague Maunsel White at Bethlehem was high-speed
steel (HSS), a class of highly alloyed tool steels that
permitted substantially higher cutting speeds than previous
cutting tools. The superiority of HSS resulted not only from
greater alloying, but also from refinements in heat
treatment. Tools of the new steel allowed cutting speeds
more than twice those of Mushet’s steel and almost four
times those of plain carbon cast steels.
Tungsten carbide (WC) was first synthesized in the
late 1890s. It took nearly three decades before a useful

cutting tool material was developed by sintering the WC
with a metallic binder to form cemented carbides. These
were first used in metal cutting in the mid-1920s in
Germany, and in the late 1920s in the United States
(Historical Note 7.2). Cermet cutting tools based on
titanium carbide were first introduced in the 1950s, but
their commercial importance dates from the 1970s. The
first coated carbides, consisting of one coating on a WC–
Co substrate, were first used around 1970. Coating
materials included TiC, TiN, and Al2O3. Modern coated
carbides have three or more coatings of these and other
hard materials.
Attempts to use alumina ceramics in machining
date from the early 1900s in Europe. Their brittleness
inhibited success in these early applications.
Processing refinements over many decades have
resulted in property improvements in these materials.
U.S. commercial use of ceramic cutting tools dates
from the mid-1950s.
The first industrial diamonds were produced by the
General Electric Company in 1954. They were single
crystal diamonds that were applied with some success in
grinding operations starting around 1957. Greater
acceptance of diamond cutting tools has resulted from
the use of sintered polycrystalline diamond (SPD), dating
from the early 1970s. A similar tool material, sintered
cubic boron nitride, was first introduced in 1969 by GE
under the trade name Borazon.

Table 23.3 identifies the cutting-tool materials, together with their approximate year of
introduction and typical maximum allowable cutting speeds at which they can be used.
Dramatic increases in machining productivity have been made possible because of advances
in tool material technology, as indicated in our table. Machine tool practice has not always
kept pace with cutting-tool technology. Limitations on horsepower, machine tool rigidity,
spindle bearings, and the widespread use of older equipment in industry have acted to
underutilize the possible upper speeds permitted by available cutting tools.

23.2.1 HIGH-SPEED STEEL AND ITS PREDECESSORS
Before the development of high-speed steel, plain carbon steel and Mushet’s steel were
the principal tool materials for metal cutting. Today, these steels are rarely used in

The parameter values are approximated for turning at feed ¼ 0.25 mm/rev (0.010 in/rev) and depth ¼

iron. Steel cutting refers to the machining of mild (unhardened) steel. It should be noted that significant
variations in these values can be expected in practice.

industrial machining applications. The plain carbon steels used as cutting tools could be
heat-treated to achieve relatively high hardness (Rockwell C 60), because of their fairly
high carbon content. However, because of low alloying levels, they possess poor hot
hardness (Figure 23.6), which renders them unusable in metal cutting except at speeds
too low to be practical by today’s standards. Mushet’s steel has been displaced by
advances in tool steel metallurgy.
High-speed steel (HSS) is a highly alloyed tool steel capable of maintaining hardness
at elevated temperatures better than high carbon and low alloy steels. Its good hot hardness
permits tools made of HSS to be used at higher cutting speeds. Compared with the other
tool materials at the time of its development, it was truly deserving of its name ‘‘high
speed.’’ A wide variety of high-speed steels are available, but they can be divided into two
basic types: (1) tungsten-type, designated T-grades by the American Iron and Steel
Institute (AISI); and (2) molybdenum-type, designated M-grades by AISI.
Tungsten-type HSS contains tungsten (W) as its principal alloying ingredient.
Additional alloying elements are chromium (Cr), and vanadium (V). One of the original
and best known HSS grades is T1, or 18-4-1 high-speed steel, containing 18% W, 4% Cr, and
1% V. Molybdenum HSS grades contain combinations of tungsten and molybdenum (Mo),
plus the same additional alloying elements as in the T-grades. Cobalt (Co) is sometimes
added to HSS to enhance hot hardness. Of course, high-speed steel contains carbon, the
element common to all steels. Typical alloying contents and functions of each alloying
element in HSS are listed in Table 23.4.
Commercially, high-speed steel is one of the most important cutting-tool materials
in use today, despite the fact that it was introduced more than a century ago. HSS is
especially suited to applications involving complicated tool geometries, such as drills,
taps, milling cutters, and broaches. These complex shapes are generally easier and less
expensive to produce from unhardened HSS than other tool materials. They can then be
heat-treated so that cutting-edge hardness is very good (Rockwell C 65), whereas
toughness of the internal portions of the tool is also good. HSS cutters possess better
toughness than any of the harder nonsteel tool materials used for machining, such as
cemented carbides and ceramics. Even for single-point tools, HSS is popular among
machinists because of the ease with which desired tool geometry can be ground into the
tool point. Over the years, improvements have been made in the metallurgical formulation and processing of HSS so that this class of tool material remains competitive in
many applications. Also, HSS tools, drills in particular, are often coated with a thin film

of titanium nitride (TiN) to provide significant increases in cutting performance.
Physical vapor deposition processes (Section 28.5.1) are commonly used to coat these
HSS tools.

23.2.2 CAST COBALT ALLOYS
Cast cobalt alloy cutting tools consist of cobalt, around 40% to 50%; chromium, about 25% to
35%; and tungsten, usually 15% to 20%; with trace amounts of other elements. These tools are
made into the desired shape by casting in graphite molds and then grinding to final size and
cutting-edge sharpness. High hardness is achieved as cast, an advantage over HSS, which
requiresheattreatmenttoachieveitshardness.Wearresistanceofthecastcobaltsisbetterthan
high-speed steel, but not as good as cemented carbide. Toughness of cast cobalt tools is better
than carbides but not as good as HSS. Hot hardness also lies between these two materials.
As might be expected from their properties, applications of cast cobalt tools are
generally between those of high-speed steel and cemented carbides. They are capable of
heavy roughing cuts at speeds greater than HSS and feeds greater than carbides. Work
materials include both steels and nonsteels, as well as nonmetallic materials such as plastics
and graphite. Today, cast cobalt alloy tools are not nearly as important commercially as
either high-speed steel or cemented carbides. They were introduced around 1915 as a tool
material that would allow higher cutting speeds than HSS. The carbides were subsequently
developed and proved to be superior to the cast Co alloys in most cutting situations.

23.2.3 CEMENTED CARBIDES, CERMETS, AND COATED CARBIDES
Cermets are defined as composites of ceramic and metallic materials (Section 9.2.1).
Technically speaking, cemented carbides are included within this definition; however,
cermets based on WC–Co, including WC–TiC–TaC–Co, are known as carbides (cemented
carbides) in common usage. In cutting-tool terminology, the term cermet is applied to

Chapter 23/Cutting-Tool Technology

ceramic-metal composites containing TiC, TiN, and certain other ceramics not including
WC. One of the advances in cutting-tool materials involves the application of a very thin
coating to a WC–Co substrate. These tools are called coated carbides. Thus, we have three
important and closely related tool materials to discuss: (1) cemented carbides, (2) cermets,
and (3) coated carbides.
Cemented Carbides Cemented carbides (also called sintered carbides) are a class of
hard tool material formulated from tungsten carbide (WC) using powder metallurgy
techniques (Chapter 16) with cobalt (Co) as the binder (Sections 7.3.2, 9.2.1, and 17.3.1).
There may be other carbide compounds in the mixture, such as titanium carbide (TiC)
and/or tantalum carbide (TaC), in addition to WC.
The first cemented carbide cutting tools were made of WC–Co (Historical Note 7.2) and
could be used to machine cast irons and nonsteel materials at cutting speeds faster than those
possible with high-speed steel and cast cobalt alloys. However, when the straight WC–Co tools
were used to cut steel, crater wear occurred rapidly, leading to early failure of the tools. A
strong chemical affinity exists between steel and the carbon in WC, resulting in accelerated
wear by diffusion and chemical reaction at the tool–chip interface for this work-tool
combination. Consequently, straight WC–Co tools cannot be used effectively to machine
steel. It was subsequently discovered that additions of titanium carbide and tantalum carbide
to the WC–Co mix significantly retarded the rate of crater wear when cutting steel. These new
WC–TiC–TaC–Co tools could be used for steel machining. The result is that cemented
carbides are divided into two basic types: (1) nonsteel-cutting grades, consisting of only WC–
Co; and (2) steel-cutting grades, with combinations of TiC and TaC added to the WC–Co.
The general properties of the two types of cemented carbides are similar: (1) high
compressive strength but low-to-moderate tensile strength; (2) high hardness (90 to 95
HRA); (3) good hot hardness; (4) good wear resistance; (5) high thermal conductivity; (6)
high modulus of elasticity—E values up to around 600  103 MPa (90  106lb/in2); and (7)
toughness lower than high-speed steel.
Nonsteel-cutting grades refer to those cemented carbides that are suitable for
machining aluminum, brass, copper, magnesium, titanium, and other nonferrous metals;
anomalously, gray cast iron is included in this group of work materials. In the nonsteelcutting grades, grain size and cobalt content are the factors that influence properties of the
cemented carbide material. The typical grain size found in conventional cemented carbides
ranges between 0.5 and 5 mm (20 and 200 m-in). As grain size is increased, hardness and hot
hardness decrease, but transverse rupture strength increases.2 The typical cobalt content in
cemented carbides used for cutting tools is 3% to 12%. The effect of cobalt content on
hardness and transverse rupture strength is shown in Figure 9.9. As cobalt content
increases, TRS improves at the expense of hardness and wear resistance. Cemented
carbides with low percentages of cobalt content (3% to 6%) have high hardness and
low TRS, whereas carbides with high Co (6% to 12%) have high TRS but lower hardness
(Table 23.1). Accordingly, cemented carbides with higher cobalt are used for roughing
operations and interrupted cuts (such as milling), while carbides with lower cobalt
(therefore, higher hardness and wear resistance) are used in finishing cuts.
Steel-cutting grades are used for low carbon, stainless, and other alloy steels. For
these carbide grades, titanium carbide and/or tantalum carbide is substituted for some of
the tungsten carbide. TiC is the more popular additive in most applications. Typically, from
10% to 25% of the WC might be replaced by combinations of TiC and TaC. This
composition increases the crater wear resistance for steel cutting, but tends to adversely
2
The effect of grain size (GS) on transverse rupture strength (TRS) is more complicated than we are
reporting. Published data indicate that the effect of GS on TRS is influenced by cobalt content. At lower
Co contents (less than 10%), TRS does indeed increase as GS increases, but at higher Co contents (greater
than 10%) TRS decreases as GS increases [4], [16].

affect flank wear resistance for nonsteel-cutting applications. That is why two basic
categories of cemented carbide are needed.
One of the important developments in cemented carbide technology in recent years is
the use of very fine grain sizes (submicron sizes) of the various carbide ingredients (WC, TiC,
and TaC). Although small grain size is usually associated with higher hardness but lower
transverse rupture strength, the decrease in TRS is reduced or reversed at the submicron
particle sizes. Therefore, these ultrafine grain carbides possess high hardness combined with
good toughness.
Since the two basic types of cemented carbide were introduced in the 1920s and 1930s,
the increasing number and variety of engineering materials have complicated the selection
of the most appropriate cemented carbide for a given machining application. To address the
problem of grade selection, two classification systems have been developed: (1) the ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) C-grade system, developed in the United States
starting around 1942; and (2) the ISO R513-1975(E) system, introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) around 1964. In the C-grade system,
summarized in Table 23.5, machining grades of cemented carbide are divided into two
basic groups, corresponding to nonsteel-cutting and steel-cutting categories. Within each
group there are four levels, corresponding to roughing, general purpose, finishing, and
precision finishing.
The ISO R513-1975(E) system, titled ‘‘Application of Carbides for Machining by Chip
Removal,’’ classifies all machining grades of cemented carbides into three basic groups, each
with its own letter and color code, as summarized in Table 23.6. Within each group, the
grades are numbered on a scale that ranges from maximum hardness to maximum
toughness. Harder grades are used for finishing operations (high speeds, low feeds and
depths), whereas tougher grades are used for roughing operations. The ISO classification
system can also be used to recommend applications for cermets and coated carbides.

The two systems map into each other as follows: The ANSI C1 through C4-grades map
into the ISO K-grades, but in reverse numerical order, and the ANSI C5 through C8 grades
translate into the ISO P-grades, but again in reverse numerical order.
Cermets Although cemented carbides are technically classified as cermet composites,
the term cermet in cutting-tool technology is generally reserved for combinations of TiC,
TiN, and titanium carbonitride (TiCN), with nickel and/or molybdenum as binders. Some of
the cermet chemistries are more complex (e.g., ceramics such as TaxNbyC and binders such
as Mo2C). However, cermets exclude metallic composites that are primarily based on WC–
Co. Applications of cermets include high-speed finishing and semifinishing of steels,
stainless steels, and cast irons. Higher speeds are generally allowed with these tools
compared with steel-cutting carbide grades. Lower feeds are typically used so that better
surface finish is achieved, often eliminating the need for grinding.
Coated Carbides The development of coated carbides around 1970 represented a
significant advance in cutting-tool technology. Coated carbides are a cemented carbide
insert coated with one or more thin layers of wear-resistant material, such as titanium
carbide, titanium nitride, and/or aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The coating is applied to the
substrate by chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition (Section 28.5). The
coating thickness is only 2.5 to 13 mm (0.0001 to 0.0005 in). It has been found that thicker
coatings tend to be brittle, resulting in cracking, chipping, and separation from the
substrate.
The first generation of coated carbides had only a single layer coating (TiC, TiN, or
Al2O3). More recently, coated inserts have been developed that consist of multiple layers.
The first layer applied to the WC–Co base is usually TiN or TiCN because of good adhesion
and similar coefficient of thermal expansion. Additional layers of various combinations of
TiN, TiCN, Al2O3, and TiAlN are subsequently applied.
Coated carbides are used to machine cast irons and steels in turning and milling
operations. They are best applied at high cutting speeds in situations in which dynamic force
and thermal shock are minimal. If these conditions become too severe, as in some
interrupted cut operations, chipping of the coating can occur, resulting in premature
tool failure. In this situation, uncoated carbides formulated for toughness are preferred.
When properly applied, coated carbide tools usually permit increases in allowable cutting
speeds compared with uncoated cemented carbides.
Use of coated carbide tools is expanding to nonferrous metal and nonmetal
applications for improved tool life and higher cutting speeds. Different coating materials
are required, such as chromium carbide (CrC), zirconium nitride (ZrN), and diamond [11].

23.2.4 CERAMICS
Cutting tools made from ceramics were first used commercially in the United States in
the mid-1950s, although their development and use in Europe dates back to the early
1900s. Today’s ceramic cutting tools are composed primarily of fine-grained aluminum
oxide (Al2O3), pressed and sintered at high pressures and temperatures with no binder
into insert form (Section 17.2). The aluminum oxide is usually very pure (99% is typical),
although some manufacturers add other oxides (such as zirconium oxide) in small
amounts. In producing ceramic tools, it is important to use a very fine grain size in
the alumina powder, and to maximize density of the mix through high-pressure compaction to improve the material’s low toughness.
Aluminum oxide cutting tools are most successful in high-speed turning of cast iron
and steel. Applications also include finish turning of hardened steels using high cutting
speeds, low feeds and depths, and a rigid work setup. Many premature fracture failures of

E1C23

567

ceramic tools are because of non-rigid machine tool setups, which subject the tools to
mechanical shock. When properly applied, ceramic cutting tools can be used to obtain
very good surface finish. Ceramics are not recommended for heavy interrupted cut
operations (e.g., rough milling) because of their low toughness. In addition to its use as
inserts in conventional machining operations, Al2O3 is widely used as an abrasive in
grinding and other abrasive processes (Chapter 25).
Other commercially available ceramic cutting-tool materials include silicon nitride
(SiN), sialon (silicon nitride and aluminum oxide, SiN–Al2O3), aluminum oxide and
titanium carbide (Al2O3–TiC), and aluminum oxide reinforced with single crystalwhiskers of silicon carbide. These tools are usually intended for special applications,
a discussion of which is beyond our scope.

23.2.5 SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS AND CUBIC BORON NITRIDE
Diamond is the hardest material known (Section 7.5.1). By some measures of hardness,
diamond is three to four times as hard as tungsten carbide or aluminum oxide. Since high
hardness is one of the desirable properties of a cutting tool, it is natural to think of diamonds
for machining and grinding applications. Synthetic diamond cutting tools are made of
sintered polycrystalline diamond (SPD), which dates from the early 1970s. Sintered
polycrystalline diamond is fabricated by sintering fine-grained diamond crystals under
high temperatures and pressures into the desired shape. Little or no binder is used. The
crystals have a random orientation and this adds considerable toughness to the SPD tools
compared with single crystal diamonds. Tool inserts are typically made by depositing a layer
of SPD about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) thick on the surface of a cemented carbide base. Very small
inserts have also been made of 100% SPD.
Applications of diamond cutting tools include high-speed machining of nonferrous
metals and abrasive nonmetals such as fiberglass, graphite, and wood. Machining of steel,
other ferrous metals, and nickel-based alloys with SPD tools is not practical because of
the chemical affinity that exists between these metals and carbon (a diamond, after all, is
carbon).
Next to diamond, cubic boron nitride (Section 7.3.3) is the hardest material known, and
its fabrication into cutting tool inserts is basically the same as SPD; that is, coatings on WC–Co
inserts. Cubic boron nitride (symbolized cBN) does not react chemically with iron and nickel
as SPD does; therefore, the applications of cBN-coated tools are for machining steel and
nickel-based alloys. Both SPD and cBN tools are expensive, as one might expect, and the
applications must justify the additional tooling cost.

23.3

TOOL GEOMETRY
A cutting tool must possess a shape that is suited to the machining operation. One
important way to classify cutting tools is according to the machining process. Thus, we
have turning tools, cutoff tools, milling cutters, drill bits, reamers, taps, and many other
cutting tools that are named for the operation in which they are used, each with its own
tool geometry—in some cases quite unique.
As indicated in Section 21.1, cutting tools can be divided into single-point tools and
multiple-cutting-edge tools. Single-point tools are used in turning, boring, shaping, and
planing. Multiple-cutting-edge tools are used in drilling, reaming, tapping, milling, broaching, and sawing. Many of the principles that apply to single-point tools also apply to the
other cutting-tool types, simply because the mechanism of chip formation is basically the
same for all machining operations.

23.3.1 SINGLE-POINT TOOL GEOMETRY
The general shape of a single-point cutting tool is illustrated in Figure 21.4(a). Figure 23.7
shows a more detailed drawing. The reader can observe single-point tools in action in our
video clip on turning and lathe basics.
VIDEO CLIP
Turning and Lathe Basics. The relevant segment is titled ‘‘Turning Operations.’’

We have previously treated the rake angle of a cutting tool as one parameter. In a
single-point tool, the orientation of the rake face is defined by two angles, back rake angle
(ab) and side rake angle (as). Together, these angles are influential in determining the
direction of chip flow across the rake face. The flank surface of the tool is defined by the end
relief angle (ERA) and side relief angle (SRA). These angles determine the amount of
clearance between the tool and the freshly cut work surface. The cutting edge of a singlepoint tool is divided into two sections, side cutting edge and end cutting edge. These two
sections are separated by the tool point, which has a certain radius, called the nose radius.
The side cutting edge angle (SCEA) determines the entry of the tool into the work and can
be used to reduce the sudden force the tool experiences as it enters a workpart. Nose radius
(NR) determines to a large degree the texture of the surface generated in the operation. A
very pointed tool (small nose radius) results in very pronounced feed marks on the surface.
We return to this issue of surface roughness in machining in Section 24.2.2. End cutting edge
angle (ECEA) provides a clearance between the trailing edge of the tool and the newly
generated work surface, thus reducing rubbing and friction against the surface.
In all, there are seven elements of tool geometry for a single-point tool. When
specified in the following order, they are collectively called the tool geometry signature:
back rake angle, side rake angle, end relief angle, side relief angle, end cutting edge angle,
side cutting edge angle, and nose radius. For example, a single-point tool used in turning
might have the following signature: 5, 5, 7, 7, 20, 15, 2/64 in.

FIGURE 23.8 Two
methods of chip breaking
in single-point tools:
(a) groove-type and
(b) obstruction-type chip
breakers.

Chip Breakers Chip disposal is a problem that is often encountered in turning and other
continuous operations. Long, stringy chips are often generated, especially when turning ductile
materials at high speeds. These chips cause a hazard to the machine operator and the workpart
finish, and they interfere with automatic operation of the turning process. Chip breakers are
frequently used with single-point tools to force the chips to curl more tightly than they would
naturally be inclined to do, thus causing them to fracture. There are two principal forms of
chip breaker design commonly used on single-point turning tools, illustrated in Figure 23.8:
(a) groove-type chip breaker designed into the cutting tool itself, and (b) obstruction-type
chip breaker designed as an additional device on the rake face of the tool. The chip breaker
distance can be adjusted in the obstruction-type device for different cutting conditions.
Effect of Tool Material on Tool Geometry It was noted in our discussion of the
Merchant equation (Section 21.3.2) that a positive rake angle is generally desirable because
it reduces cutting forces, temperature, and power consumption. High-speed steel-cutting
tools are almost always ground with positive rake angles, typically ranging from +5 to +20 .
HSS has good strength and toughness, so that the thinner cross section of the tool created by
high positive rake angles does not usually cause a problem with tool breakage. HSS tools
are predominantly made of one piece. The heat treatment of high-speed steel can be
controlled to provide a hard cutting edge while maintaining a tough inner core.
With the development of the very hard tool materials (e.g., cemented carbides and
ceramics), changes in tool geometry were required. As a group, these materials have
higher hardness and lower toughness than HSS. Also, their shear and tensile strengths are
low relative to their compressive strengths, and their properties cannot be manipulated
through heat treatment like those of HSS. Finally, cost per unit weight for these very hard
materials is higher than the cost of HSS. These factors have affected cutting-tool design
for the very hard tool materials in several ways.
First, the very hard materials must be designed with either negative rake or small
positive angles. This change tends to load the tool more in compression and less in shear, thus
favoring the high compressive strength of these harder materials. Cemented carbides, for
example, are used with rake angles typically in the range from 5 to +10 . Ceramics have
rake angles between 5 and 15 . Relief angles are made as small as possible (5 is typical)
to provide as much support for the cutting edge as possible.
Another difference is the way in which the cutting edge of the tool is held in position.
The alternative ways of holding and presenting the cutting edge for a single-point tool are
illustrated in Figure 23.9. The geometry of a HSS tool is ground from a solid shank, as shown
in part (a) of the figure. The higher cost and differences in properties and processing of the
harder tool materials have given rise to the use of inserts that are either brazed or
mechanically clamped to a toolholder. Part (b) shows a brazed insert, in which a cemented

tool, typical of HSS; (b) brazed insert, one way of holding a cemented carbide insert; and (c) mechanically
clamped insert, used for cemented carbides, ceramics, and other very hard tool materials.

carbide insert is brazed to a tool shank. The shank is made of tool steel for strength and
toughness. Part (c) illustrates one possible design for mechanically clamping an insert in a
toolholder. Mechanical clamping is used for cemented carbides, ceramics, and the other
hard materials. The significant advantage of the mechanically clamped insert is that each
insert contains multiple cutting edges. When an edge wears out, the insert is unclamped,
indexed (rotated in the toolholder) to the next edge, and reclamped in the toolholder. When
all of the cutting edges are worn, the insert is discarded and replaced.
Inserts Cutting-tool inserts are widely used in machining because they are economical
and adaptable to many different types of machining operations: turning, boring, threading,
milling, and even drilling. They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes for the variety
of cutting situations encountered in practice. A square insert is shown in Figure 23.9(c).

the largest point angle should be selected for strength and economy. Round inserts possess
large point angles (and large nose radii) just because of their shape. Inserts with large point
angles are inherently stronger and less likely to chip or break during cutting, but they
require more power, and there is a greater likelihood of vibration. The economic
advantage of round inserts is that they can be indexed multiple times for more cuts
per insert. Square inserts present four cutting edges, triangular shapes have three edges,
whereas rhombus shapes have only two. Fewer edges are a cost disadvantage. If both
sides of the insert can be used (e.g., in most negative rake angle applications), then the
number of cutting edges is doubled. Rhombus shapes are used (especially with acute
point angles) because of their versatility and accessibility when a variety of operations
are to be performed. These shapes can be more readily positioned in tight spaces and can
be used not only for turning but also for facing (Figure 22.6(a)), and contour turning
(Figure 22.6(c)).
Inserts are usually not made with perfectly sharp cutting edges, because a sharp
edge is weaker and fractures more easily, especially for the very hard and brittle tool
materials from which inserts are made (cemented carbides, coated carbides, cermets,
ceramics, cBN, and diamond). Some kind of shape alteration is commonly performed on
the cutting edge at an almost microscopic level. The effect of this edge preparation is to
increase the strength of the cutting edge by providing a more gradual transition between
the clearance edge and the rake face of the tool. Three common edge preparations are
shown in Figure 23.11: (a) radius or edge rounding, also referred to as honed edge,
(b) chamfer, and (c) land. For comparison, a perfectly sharp cutting edge is shown in
(d). The radius in (a) is typically only about 0.025 mm (0.001 in), and the land in (c) is 15
or 20 . Combinations of these edge preparations are often applied to a single cutting edge
to maximize the strengthening effect.

23.3.2 MULTIPLE-CUTTING-EDGE TOOLS
Most multiple-cutting-edge tools are used in machining operations in which the tool is
rotated. Primary examples are drilling and milling. On the other hand, broaching and
some sawing operations (hack sawing and band sawing) use multiple-cutting-edge tools
that operate with a linear motion. Other sawing operations (circular sawing) use rotating
saw blades.
Drills Various cutting tools are available for hole making, but the twist drill is by far the
most common. It comes in diameters ranging from about 0.15 mm (0.006 in) to as large as

75 mm (3.0 in). Twist drills are widely used in industry to produce holes rapidly and
economically. The video clip on hole making illustrates the twist drill.
VIDEO CLIP
Hole making. See the segment titled ‘‘The Drill.’’

The standard twist drill geometry is illustrated in Figure 23.12. The body of the drill
has two spiral flutes (the spiral gives the twist drill its name). The angle of the spiral flutes
is called the helix angle, a typical value of which is around 30 . While drilling, the flutes
act as passageways for extraction of chips from the hole. Although it is desirable for the
flute openings to be large to provide maximum clearance for the chips, the body of the
drill must be supported over its length. This support is provided by the web, which is the
thickness of the drill between the flutes.
The point of the twist drill has a conical shape. A typical value for the point angle is
118 . The point can be designed in various ways, but the most common design is a chisel
edge, as in Figure 23.12. Connected to the chisel edge are two cutting edges (sometimes
called lips) that lead into the flutes. The portion of each flute adjacent to the cutting edge
acts as the rake face of the tool.
The cutting action of the twist drill is complex. The rotation and feeding of the drill bit
result in relative motion between the cutting edges and the workpiece to form the chips. The
cutting speed along each cutting edge varies as a function of the distance from the axis of
rotation. Accordingly, the efficiency of the cutting action varies, being most efficient at the
outer diameter of the drill and least efficient at the center. In fact, the relative velocity at the
drill point is zero, so no cutting takes place. Instead, the chisel edge of the drill point pushes
aside the material at the center as it penetrates into the hole; a large thrust force is required
to drive the twist drill forward into the hole. Also, at the beginning of the operation, the
rotating chisel edge tends to wander on the surface of the workpart, causing loss of
positional accuracy. Various alternative drill point designs have been developed to address
this problem.
Chip removal can be a problem in drilling. The cutting action takes place inside the
hole, and the flutes must provide sufficient clearance throughout the length of the drill to
allow the chips to be extracted from the hole. As the chip is formed it is forced through
the flutes to the work surface. Friction makes matters worse in two ways. In addition to
the usual friction in metal cutting between the chip and the rake face of the cutting edge,
friction also results from rubbing between the outside diameter of the drill bit and the

newly formed hole. This increases the temperature of the drill and work. Delivery of
cutting fluid to the drill point to reduce the friction and heat is difficult because the chips
are flowing in the opposite direction. Because of chip removal and heat, a twist drill is
normally limited to a hole depth of about four times its diameter. Some twist drills are
designed with internal holes running their lengths, through which cutting fluid can be
pumped to the hole near the drill point, thus delivering the fluid directly to the cutting
operation. An alternative approach with twist drills that do not have fluid holes is to use a
‘‘pecking’’ procedure during the drilling operation. In this procedure, the drill is
periodically withdrawn from the hole to clear the chips before proceeding deeper.
Twist drills are normally made of high-speed steel. The geometry of the drill is
fabricated before heat treatment, and then the outer shell of the drill (cutting edges and
friction surfaces) is hardened while retaining an inner core that is relatively tough.
Grinding is used to sharpen the cutting edges and shape the drill point.
Although twist drills are the most common hole-making tools, other drill types are
also available. Straight-flute drills operate like twist drills except that the flutes for chip
removal are straight along the length of the tool rather than spiraled. The simpler design
of the straight-flute drill permits carbide tips to be used as the cutting edges, either as
brazed or indexable inserts. Figure 23.13 illustrates the straight-flute indexable-insert
drill. The cemented carbide inserts allow higher cutting speeds and greater production
rates than HSS twist drills. However, the inserts limit how small the drills can be made.
Thus, the diameter range of commercially available indexable-insert drills runs from
about 16 mm (0.625 in) to about 127 mm (5 in) [9].
A straight-flute drill designed for deep-hole drilling is the gun drill, shown in
Figure 23.14. Whereas the twist drill is usually limited to a depth-to-diameter ratio of 4:1,
and the straight-flute drill to about 3:1, the gun drill can cut holes up to 125 times its diameter.
As shown in our figure, the gun drill has a carbide cutting edge, a single flute for chip removal,
and a coolant hole running its complete length. In the typical gun drilling operation, the work
rotates around the stationary drill (opposite of most drilling operations), and the coolant
flows into the cutting process and out of the hole along the flute, carrying the chips with it.
Gun drills range in diameter from less than 2 mm (0.075 in) to about 50 mm (2 in).
It was previously mentioned that twist drills are available with diameters up to 75 mm
(3 in). Twist drills that large are uncommon because so much metal is required in the drill
bit. An alternative for large diameter holes is the spade drill, illustrated in Figure 23.15.
Standard sizes range from 25 to 152 mm (1 to 6 in). The interchangeable drill bit is held in a

Milling Cutters Classification of milling cutters is closely associated with the milling
operations described in Section 22.4.1. The video clip on milling shows some of the tools
in operation. The major types of milling cutters are the following:
å Plain milling cutters. These are used for peripheral or slab milling. As Figures 22.17
(a) and 22.18(a) indicate, they are cylinder shaped with several rows of teeth. The
cutting edges are usually oriented at a helix angle (as in the figures) to reduce impact on
entry into the work, and these cutters are called helical milling cutters. Tool geometry
elements of a plain milling cutter are shown in Figure 23.16.
å Form milling cutters. These are peripheral milling cutters in which the cutting edges
have a special profile that is to be imparted to the work. An important application is
in gear making, in which the form milling cutter is shaped to cut the slots between
adjacent gear teeth, thereby leaving the geometry of the gear teeth.
å Face milling cutters. These are designed with teeth that cut on both the periphery
as well as the end of the cutter. Face milling cutters can be made of HSS, as in

å End milling cutters. As shown in Figure 22.20(c), an end milling cutter looks like a
drill bit, but close inspection indicates that it is designed for primary cutting with its
peripheral teeth rather than its end. (A drill bit cuts only on its end as it penetrates
into the work.) End mills are designed with square ends, ends with radii, and ball
ends. End mills can be used for face milling, profile milling and pocketing, cutting
slots, engraving, surface contouring, and die sinking.

broach: (a) terminology of
the tooth geometry, and
(b) a typical broach used
for internal broaching.

Broaches The terminology and geometry of the broach are illustrated in Figure 23.18.
The broach consists of a series of distinct cutting teeth along its length. Feed is
accomplished by the increased step between successive teeth on the broach. This feeding
action is unique among machining operations, because most operations accomplish
feeding by a relative feed motion that is carried out by either the tool or the work.
The total material removed in a single pass of the broach is the cumulative result of all the
steps in the tool. The speed motion is accomplished by the linear travel of the tool past the
work surface. The shape of the cut surface is determined by the contour of the cutting
edges on the broach, particularly the final cutting edge. Owing to its complex geometry
and the low speeds used in broaching, most broaches are made of HSS. In broaching of
certain cast irons, the cutting edges are cemented carbide inserts either brazed or
mechanically held in place on the broaching tool.
Saw Blades For each of the three sawing operations (Section 22.6.3), the saw blades
possess certain common features, including tooth form, tooth spacing, and tooth set, as seen
in Figure 23.19. Tooth form is concerned with the geometry of each cutting tooth. Rake
angle, clearance angle, tooth spacing, and other features of geometry are shown in
Figure 23.19(a). Tooth spacing is the distance between adjacent teeth on the saw blade.
This parameter determines the size of the teeth and the size of the gullet between teeth. The
gullet allows space for the formation of the chip by the adjacent cutting tooth. Different
tooth forms are appropriate for different work materials and cutting situations. Two forms
commonly used in hacksaw and bandsaw blades are shown in Figure 23.19(b). The tooth set
permits the kerf cut by the saw blade to be wider than the width of the blade itself; otherwise
the blade would bind against the walls of the slit made by the saw. Two common tooth sets
are illustrated in Figure 23.19(c).

23.4

CUTTING FLUIDS
A cutting fluid is any liquid or gas that is applied directly to the machining operation to
improve cutting performance. Cutting fluids address two main problems: (1) heat generation at the shear zone and friction zone, and (2) friction at the tool–chip and tool–work
interfaces. In addition to removing heat and reducing friction, cutting fluids provide
additional benefits, such as washing away chips (especially in grinding and milling),
reducing the temperature of the workpart for easier handling, reducing cutting forces and
power requirements, improving dimensional stability of the workpart, and improving
surface finish.

23.4.1 TYPES OF CUTTING FLUIDS
A variety of cutting fluids are commercially available. It is appropriate to discuss them
first according to function and then to classify them according to chemical formulation.
Cutting Fluid Functions There are two general categories of cutting fluids, corresponding to the two main problems they are designed to address: coolants and lubricants.
Coolants are cutting fluids designed to reduce the effects of heat in the machining
operation. They have a limited effect on the amount of heat energy generated in cutting;
instead, they carry away the heat that is generated, thereby reducing the temperature of
tool and workpiece. This helps to prolong the life of the cutting tool. The capacity of a
cutting fluid to reduce temperatures in machining depends on its thermal properties.

E1C23

16:40:54

Chapter 23/Cutting-Tool Technology

Specific heat and thermal conductivity are the most important properties (Section 4.2.1).
Water has high specific heat and thermal conductivity relative to other liquids, which is why
water is used as the base in coolant-type cutting fluids. These properties allow the coolant to
draw heat away from the operation, thereby reducing the temperature of the cutting tool.
Coolant-type cutting fluids seem to be most effective at relatively high cutting
speeds, in which heat generation and high temperatures are problems. They are most
effective on tool materials that are most susceptible to temperature failures, such as highspeed steels, and are used frequently in turning and milling operations, in which large
amounts of heat are generated.
Lubricants are usually oil-based fluids (because oils possess good lubricating
qualities) formulated to reduce friction at the tool–chip and tool–work interfaces. Lubricant cutting fluids operate by extreme pressure lubrication, a special form of lubrication
that involves formation of thin solid salt layers on the hot, clean metal surfaces through
chemical reaction with the lubricant. Compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorus in the
lubricant cause the formation of these surface layers, which act to separate the two metal
surfaces (i.e., chip and tool). These extreme pressure films are significantly more effective in
reducing friction in metal cutting than conventional lubrication, which is based on the
presence of liquid films between the two surfaces.
Lubricant-type cutting fluids are most effective at lower cutting speeds. They tend
to lose their effectiveness at high speeds (above about 120 m/min [400 ft/min]) because
the motion of the chip at these speeds prevents the cutting fluid from reaching the tool–
chip interface. In addition, high cutting temperatures at these speeds cause the oils to
vaporize before they can lubricate. Machining operations such as drilling and tapping
usually benefit from lubricants. In these operations, built-up edge formation is retarded,
and torque on the tool is reduced.
Although the principal purpose of a lubricant is to reduce friction, it also reduces the
temperature in the operation through several mechanisms. First, the specific heat and
thermal conductivity of the lubricant help to remove heat from the operation, thereby
reducing temperatures. Second, because friction is reduced, the heat generated from
friction is also reduced. Third, a lower coefficient of friction means a lower friction angle.
According to Merchant’s equation, Eq. (21.16), a lower friction angle causes the shear plane
angle to increase, hence reducing the amount of heat energy generated in the shear zone.
There is typically an overlapping effect between the two types of cutting fluids.
Coolants are formulated with ingredients that help reduce friction. And lubricants have
thermal properties that, although not as good as those of water, act to remove heat from
the cutting operation. Cutting fluids (both coolants and lubricants) manifest their effect
on the Taylor tool life equation through higher C values. Increases of 10% to 40% are
typical. The slope n is not significantly affected.
Chemical Formulation of Cutting Fluids There are four categories of cutting fluids
according to chemical formulation: (1) cutting oils, (2) emulsified oils, (3) semichemical
fluids, and (4) chemical fluids. All of these cutting fluids provide both coolant and
lubricating functions. The cutting oils are most effective as lubricants, whereas the other
three categories are more effective as coolants because they are primarily water.
Cutting oils are based on oil derived from petroleum, animal, marine, or vegetable
origin. Mineral oils (petroleum based) are the principal type because of their abundance and
generally desirable lubricating characteristics. To achieve maximum lubricity, several types of
oils are often combined in the same fluid. Chemical additives are also mixed with the oils to
increase lubricating qualities. These additives contain compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and
phosphorus, and are designed to react chemically with the chip and tool surfaces to form solid
films(extremepressurelubrication)thathelptoavoidmetal-to-metalcontactbetweenthetwo.
Emulsified oils consist of oil droplets suspended in water. The fluid is made by
blending oil (usually mineral oil) in water using an emulsifying agent to promote blending

E1C23

579

and stability of the emulsion. A typical ratio of water to oil is 30:1. Chemical additives
based on sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorus are often used to promote extreme pressure
lubrication. Because they contain both oil and water, the emulsified oils combine cooling
and lubricating qualities in one cutting fluid.
Chemical fluids are chemicals in a water solution rather than oils in emulsion. The
dissolved chemicals include compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorus, plus wetting
agents. The chemicals are intended to provide some degree of lubrication to the solution.
Chemical fluids provide good coolant qualities but their lubricating qualities are less than
the other cutting fluid types. Semichemical fluids have small amounts of emulsified oil
added to increase the lubricating characteristics of the cutting fluid. In effect, they are a
hybrid class between chemical fluids and emulsified oils.

23.4.2 APPLICATION OF CUTTING FLUIDS
Cutting fluids are applied to machining operations in various ways. In this section we
consider these application techniques. We also consider the problem of cutting-fluid
contamination and what steps can be taken to address this problem.
Application Methods The most common method is flooding, sometimes called floodcooling because it is generally used with coolant-type cutting fluids. In flooding, a steady
stream of fluid is directed at the tool–work or tool–chip interface of the machining
operation. A second method of delivery is mist application, primarily used for waterbased cutting fluids. In this method the fluid is directed at the operation in the form of a
high-speed mist carried by a pressurized air stream. Mist application is generally not as
effective as flooding in cooling the tool. However, because of the high-velocity air stream,
mist application may be more effective in delivering the cutting fluid to areas that are
difficult to access by conventional flooding.
Manual application by means of a squirt can or paint brush is sometimes used for
applying lubricants in tapping and other operations in which cutting speeds are low and
friction is a problem. It is generally not preferred by most production machine shops
because of its variability in application.
Cutting Fluid Filtration and Dry Machining Cutting fluids become contaminated over
time with a variety of foreign substances, such as tramp oil (machine oil, hydraulic fluid,
etc.), garbage (cigarette butts, food, etc.), small chips, molds, fungi, and bacteria. In addition
to causing odors and health hazards, contaminated cutting fluids do not perform their
lubricating function as well. Alternative ways of dealing with this problem are to: (1)
replace the cutting fluid at regular and frequent intervals (perhaps twice per month); (2)
use a filtration system to continuously or periodically clean the fluid; or (3) dry machining;
that is, machine without cutting fluids. Because of growing concern about environmental
pollution and associated legislation, disposing old fluids has become both costly and
contrary to the general public welfare.
Filtration systems are being installed in numerous machine shops today to solve the
contamination problem. Advantages of these systems include: (1) prolonged cutting fluid
life between changes—instead of replacing the fluid once or twice per month, coolant lives
of 1 year have been reported; (2) reduced fluid disposal cost, since disposal is much less
frequent when a filter is used; (3) cleaner cutting fluid for better working environment and
reduced health hazards; (4) lower machine tool maintenance; and (5) longer tool life.
There are various types of filtration systems for filtering cutting fluids. For the interested
reader, filtration systems and the benefits of using them are discussed in reference [19].
The third alternative is called dry machining, meaning that no cutting fluid is used.
Dry machining avoids the problems of cutting fluid contamination, disposal, and filtration,
but can lead to problems of its own: (1) overheating the tool, (2) operating at lower cutting

speeds and production rates to prolong tool life, and (3) absence of chip removal benefits
in grinding and milling. Cutting-tool producers have developed certain grades of carbides
and coated carbides for use in dry machining.

min, 0.80 mm at 11 min, and 0.99 mm at 13 min. The

wear ¼ 0.007 in at 1 min, 0.017 in at 5 min, 0.027 in
at 9 min, 0.033 in at 11 min, and 0.040 in at 13 min.
The last value in each case is when final tool failure
occurred. (a) On a single piece of linear graph
paper, plot flank wear as a function of time. Using
0.020 in of flank wear as the criterion of tool failure,
determine the tool lives for the two cutting speeds.
(b) On a piece of natural log–log paper, plot your

should be used to get 20 minutes of tool life?
Tool life tests on a lathe have resulted in the
following data: (1) at a cutting speed of 375 ft/
min, the tool life was 5.5 min; (2) at a cutting speed
of 275 ft/min, the tool life was 53 min. (a) Determine the parameters n and C in the Taylor tool life
equation. (b) Based on the n and C values, what is
the likely tool material used in this operation?

cutting speed ¼ 4.0 m/s and a 20-min tool life at a
speed ¼ 2.0 m/s. (a) Find the n and C values in the
Taylor tool life equation. (b) Project how long the
tool would last at a speed of 1.0 m/s.
A 15.0-in  2.0-in-workpart is machined in a face
milling operation using a 2.5-in diameter fly cutter
with a single carbide insert. The machine is set for a
feed of 0.010 in/tooth and a depth of 0.20 in. If a
cutting speed of 400 ft/min is used, the tool lasts for
three pieces. If a cutting speed of 200 ft/min is used,
the tool lasts for 12 parts. Determine the Taylor
tool life equation.
In a production turning operation, the workpart is
125 mm in diameter and 300 mm long. A feed of
0.225 mm/rev is used in the operation. If cutting
speed ¼ 3.0 m/s, the tool must be changed every
five workparts; but if cutting speed ¼ 2.0 m/s, the
tool can be used to produce 25 pieces between tool
changes. Determine the Taylor tool life equation
for this job.
For the tool life plot of Figure 23.5, show that the
middle data point (v ¼ 130 m/min, T ¼ 12 min) is
consistent with the Taylor equation determined in
Example Problem 23.1.
In the tool wear plots of Figure 23.4, complete
failure of the cutting tool is indicated by the end
of each wear curve. Using complete failure as the
criterion of tool life instead of 0.50 mm flank
wear, the resulting data are: (1) v ¼ 160 m/min,
T ¼ 5.75 min; (2) v ¼ 130 m/min, T ¼ 14.25 min;
and (3) v ¼ 100 m/min, T ¼ 47 min. Determine the
parameters n and C in the Taylor tool life equation
for this data.
The Taylor equation for a certain set of test conditions is vT.25 ¼ 1000, where the U.S. customary
units are used: ft/min for v and min for T. Convert
this equation to the equivalent Taylor equation in
the International System of units (metric), where v
is in m/sec and T is in seconds. Validate the metric
equation using a tool life ¼ 16 min. That is, compute the corresponding cutting speeds in ft/min and
m/sec using the two equations.
A series of turning tests are performed to determine
the parameters n, m, and K in the expanded version
of the Taylor equation, Eq. (23.4). The following
data were obtained during the tests: (1) cutting
speed ¼ 1.9 m/s, feed ¼ 0.22 mm/rev, tool life ¼
10 min; (2) cutting speed ¼ 1.3 m/s, feed ¼ 0.22 mm/

feed ¼ 0.32 mm/rev, tool life ¼ 8 min. (a) Determine
n, m, and K. (b) Using your equation, compute the
tool life when the cutting speed is 1.5 m/s and the feed
is 0.28 mm/rev.
Eq. (23.4) in the text relates tool life to speed and
feed. In a series of turning tests conducted to
determine the parameters n, m, and K, the following data were collected: (1) v ¼ 400 ft/min, f ¼ 0.010
in/rev, T ¼ 10 min; (2) v ¼ 300 ft/min, f ¼ 0.010 in/
rev, T ¼ 35 min; and (3) v ¼ 400 ft/min, f ¼ 0.015 in/
rev, T ¼ 8 min. Determine n, m, and K. What is the
physical interpretation of the constant K?
The n and C values in Table 23.2 are based on a feed
rate of 0.25 mm/rev and a depth of cut ¼ 2.5 mm.
Determine how many cubic mm of steel would be
removed for each of the following tool materials,
if a 10-min tool life were required in each case:
(a) plain carbon steel, (b) high speed steel,
(c) cemented carbide, and (d) ceramic. Use of a
spreadsheet calculator is recommended.
A drilling operation is performed in which 0.5 in
diameter holes are drilled through cast iron plates
that are 1.0 in thick. Sample holes have been drilled
to determine the tool life at two cutting speeds. At
80 surface ft/min, the tool lasted for exactly 50
holes. At 120 surface ft/min, the tool lasted for
exactly five holes. The feed of the drill was 0.003 in/
rev. (Ignore effects of drill entrance and exit from
the hole. Consider the depth of cut to be exactly
1.00 in, corresponding to the plate thickness.) Determine the values of n and C in the Taylor tool life
equation for the above sample data, where cutting
speed v is expressed in ft/min, and tool life T is
expressed in min.
The outside diameter of a cylinder made of titanium alloy is to be turned. The starting diameter is
400 mm and the length is 1100 mm. The feed is 0.35
mm/rev and the depth of cut is 2.5 mm. The cut will
be made with a cemented carbide cutting tool
whose Taylor tool life parameters are: n ¼ 0.24
and C ¼ 450. Units for the Taylor equation are min
for tool life and m/min for cutting speed. Compute
the cutting speed that will allow the tool life to be
just equal to the cutting time for this part.
The outside diameter of a roll for a steel rolling mill
is to be turned. In the final pass, the starting

583

diameter ¼ 26.25 in and the length ¼ 48.0 in. The
cutting conditions will be: feed ¼ 0.0125 in/rev,
and depth of cut ¼ 0.125 in. A cemented carbide
cutting tool is to be used and the parameters of the
Taylor tool life equation for this setup are: n ¼ 0.25
and C ¼ 1300. Units for the Taylor equation are
min for tool life and ft/min for cutting speed. It is
desirable to operate at a cutting speed so that the
tool will not need to be changed during the cut.
Determine the cutting speed that will make the tool
life equal to the time required to complete the
turning operation.
23.19. The workpart in a turning operation is 88 mm in
diameter and 400 mm long. A feed of 0.25 mm/rev
is used in the operation. If cutting speed ¼ 3.5 m/s,
the tool must be changed every three workparts;
but if cutting speed ¼ 2.5 m/s, the tool can be used
to produce 20 pieces between tool changes. Determine the cutting speed that will allow the tool to be
used for 50 parts between tool changes.
23.20. In a production turning operation, the steel workpart has a 4.5 in diameter and is 17.5 in long. A feed
of 0.012 in/rev is used in the operation. If cutting
speed ¼ 400 ft/min, the tool must be changed every
four workparts; but if cutting speed ¼ 275 ft/min,
the tool can be used to produce 15 pieces between
tool changes. A new order for 25 pieces has been
received but the dimensions of the workpart have
been changed. The new diameter is 3.5 in, and the
new length is 15.0 in. The work material and tooling
remain the same, and the feed and depth are also
unchanged, so the Taylor tool life equation determined for the previous workparts is valid for the
new parts. Determine the cutting speed that will
allow one cutting tool to be used for the new order.
23.21. The outside diameter of a cylinder made of a steel
alloy is to be turned. The starting diameter is 300 mm
and the length is 625 mm. The feed is 0.35 mm/rev
and the depth of cut is 2.5 mm. The cut will be made
with a cemented carbide cutting tool whose Taylor
tool life parameters are: n ¼ 0.24 and C ¼ 450. Units
for the Taylor equation are min for tool life and m/
min for cutting speed. Compute the cutting speed
that will allow the tool life to be just equal to the
cutting time for three of these parts.

(b) making a final face milling pass using a shallow

depth of cut and feed on a titanium part, (c) boring

the inlet and outlet of a large brass valve.

23.23. A certain machine shop uses four cemented carbide
grades in its operations. The chemical composition
of these grades are as follows: Grade 1 contains 95%
WC and 5% Co; Grade 2 contains 82% WC, 4% Co,
and 14% TiC; Grade 3 contains 80% WC, 10% Co,

turning of unhardened steel? (b) Which grade
should be used for rough milling of aluminum?
(c) Which grade should be used for finish turning
of brass? (d) Which of the grades listed would be
suitable for machining cast iron? For each case,
explain your recommendation.
23.24. List the ISO R513-1975(E) group (letter and color
in Table 23.6) and whether the number would be
toward the lower or higher end of the ranges for
each of the following situations: (a) milling the
head gasket surface of an aluminum cylinder

head of an automobile (cylinder head has a hole
for each cylinder and must be very flat and smooth
to mate up with the block), (b) rough turning a
hardened steel shaft, (c) milling a fiber-reinforced
polymer composite that requires a precise finish,
and (d) milling the rough shape in a die made of
steel before it is hardened.
23.25. A turning operation is performed on a steel shaft with
diameter ¼ 5.0 in and length ¼ 32 in. A slot or keyway
has been milled along its entire length. The turning
operation reduces the shaft diameter. For each of the
following tool materials, indicate whether it is a reasonable candidate to use in the operation: (a) plain
carbon steel, (b) high-speed steel, (c) cemented
carbide, (d) ceramic, and (e) sintered polycrystalline diamond. For each material that is not
a good candidate, give the reason why it is not.

Cutting Fluids
23.26. In a milling operation with no coolant, a cutting
speed of 500 ft/min is used. The current cutting
conditions (dry) yield Taylor tool life equation
parameters of n ¼ 0.25 and C ¼ 1300 (ft/min).
When a coolant is used in the operation, the cutting
speed can be increased by 20% and still maintain
the same tool life. Assuming n does not change with
the addition of coolant, what is the resulting change
in the value of C?
23.27. In a turning operation using high-speed steel tooling, cutting speed ¼ 110 m/min. The Taylor tool life
equation has parameters n ¼ 0.140 and C ¼ 150 (m/
min) when the operation is conducted dry. When a
coolant is used in the operation, the value of C is
increased by 15%. Determine the percent increase
in tool life that results if the cutting speed is
maintained at 110 m/min.
23.28. A production turning operation on a steel workpiece normally operates at a cutting speed of 125 ft/
min using high-speed steel tooling with no cutting
fluid. The appropriate n and C values in the Taylor

equation are given in Table 23.2 in the text. It has
been found that the use of a coolant type cutting
fluid will allow an increase of 25 ft/min in the speed
without any effect on tool life. If it can be assumed
that the effect of the cutting fluid is simply to
increase the constant C by 25, what would be the
increase in tool life if the original cutting speed of
125 ft/min were used in the operation?
23.29. A high speed steel 6.0 mm twist drill is being used
in a production drilling operation on mild steel. A
cutting oil is applied by the operator by brushing
the lubricant onto the drill point and flutes prior to
each hole. The cutting conditions are: speed ¼
25 m/min, and feed ¼ 0.10 mm/rev, and hole
depth ¼ 40 mm. The foreman says that the ‘‘speed
and feed are right out of the handbook’’ for this
work material. Nevertheless, he says, ‘‘the chips are
clogging in the flutes, resulting in friction heat, and
the drill bit is failing prematurely because of overheating.’’ What’s the problem? What do you recommend to solve it?

In this chapter, we conclude our coverage of traditional
machining technology by discussing several remaining
topics. The first topic is machinability, which is concerned
with how work material properties affect machining performance. The second topic is concerned with the tolerances
and surface finishes (Chapter 5) that can be expected in
machining processes. Third, we consider how to select cutting conditions (speed, feed, and depth of cut) in a machining
operation. This selection determines to a large extent the
economic success of a given operation. Finally, we provide
some guidelines for product designers to consider when they
design parts that are to be produced by machining.

24.1 MACHINABILITY
Properties of the work material have a significant influence on
the success of the machining operation. These properties and
other characteristics of the work are often summarized in the
term ‘‘machinability.’’ Machinability denotes the relative
ease with which a material (usually a metal) can be machined
using appropriate tooling and cutting conditions.
There are various criteria used to evaluate machinability, the most important of which are: (1) tool life,
(2) forces and power, (3) surface finish, and (4) ease of
chip disposal. Although machinability generally refers to
the work material, it should be recognized that machining
performance depends on more than just material. The type
of machining operation, tooling, and cutting conditions are
also important factors. In addition, the machinability criterion is a source of variation. One material may yield a
longer tool life, whereas another material provides a better
surface finish. All of these factors make evaluation of
machinability difficult.

Chapter 24/Economic and Product Design Considerations in Machining

Machinability testing usually involves a comparison of work materials. The machining
performance of a test material is measured relative to that of a base (standard) material.
Possible measures of performance in machinability testing include: (1) tool life, (2) tool wear,
(3) cutting force, (4) power in the operation, (5) cutting temperature, and (6) material
removal rate under standard test conditions. The relative performance is expressed as an
index number, called the machinability rating (MR). The base material used as the standard is
given a machinability rating of 1.00. B1112 steel is often used as the base material in
machinability comparisons. Materials that are easier to machine than the base have ratings
greater than 1.00, and materials that are more difficult to machine have ratings less than 1.00.
Machinability ratings are often expressed as percentages rather than index numbers. Let us
illustrate how a machinability rating might be determined using a tool life test as the basis of
comparison.

Example 24.1
Machinability

A series of tool life tests are conducted on two work materials under identical cutting
conditions, varying only speed in the test procedure. The first material, defined as the
base material, yields a Taylor tool life equation vT 0.28 ¼ 350, and the other material
(test material) yields a Taylor equation vT 0.27 ¼ 440, where speed is in m/min and tool
life is in min. Determine the machinability rating of the test material using the cutting
speed that provides a 60-min tool life as the basis of comparison. This speed is denoted
by v60.
Solution: The base material has a machinability rating ¼ 1.0. Its v60 value can be
determined from the Taylor tool life equation as follows:

v60 ¼ 350=600:28 ¼ 111 m/min
The cutting speed at a 60-min tool life for the test material is determined similarly:

v60 ¼ 440=600:27 ¼ 146 m/min
Accordingly, the machinability rating can be calculated as
MR(for the test material) ¼

146
¼ 1:31 (131%)

n

Many work material factors affect machining performance. Important mechanical
properties include hardness and strength. As hardness increases, abrasive wear of the tool
increases so that tool life is reduced. Strength is usually indicated as tensile strength, even
though machining involves shear stresses. Of course, shear strength and tensile strength
are correlated. As work material strength increases, cutting forces, specific energy, and
cutting temperature increase, making the material more difficult to machine. On the
other hand, very low hardness can be detrimental to machining performance. For
example, low carbon steel, which has relatively low hardness, is often too ductile to
machine well. High ductility causes tearing of the metal as the chip is formed, resulting in
poor finish, and problems with chip disposal. Cold drawing is often used on low carbon
bars to increase surface hardness and promote chip-breaking during cutting.
A metal’s chemistry has an important effect on properties; and in some cases,
chemistry affects the wear mechanisms that act on the tool material. Through these
relationships, chemistry affects machinability. Carbon content has a significant effect
on the properties of steel. As carbon is increased, the strength and hardness of the steel
increase; this reduces machining performance. Many alloying elements added to steel
to enhance properties are detrimental to machinability. Chromium, molybdenum, and
tungsten form carbides in steel, which increase tool wear and reduce machinability.
Manganese and nickel add strength and toughness to steel, which reduce machinability.
Certain elements can be added to steel to improve machining performance, such as

lead, sulfur, and phosphorus. The additives have the effect of reducing the coefficient
of friction between the tool and chip, thereby reducing forces, temperature, and builtup edge formation. Better tool life and surface finish result from these effects. Steel
alloys formulated to improve machinability are referred to as free machining steels
(Section 6.2.3).
Similar relationships exist for other work materials. Table 24.1 lists selected metals
and their approximate machinability ratings. These ratings are intended to summarize the
machining performance of the materials.

and surface finishes specified by the product designer. In this section we examine these
issues of tolerance and surface finish in machining.

Drilling tolerances are typically expressed as biased bilateral tolerances (e.g., þ 0.010/–0.002).
Values in this table are expressed as closest bilateral tolerance (e.g., 0.006).
Compiled from various sources, including [2], [5], [7], [8], [12], and [15].

24.2.1 TOLERANCES IN MACHINING
There is variability in any manufacturing process, and tolerances are used to set
permissible limits on this variability (Section 5.1.1). Machining is often selected when
tolerances are close, because it is more accurate than most other shape-making processes.
Table 24.2 indicates typical tolerances that can be achieved for most machining operations examined in Chapter 22. It should be mentioned that the values in this tabulation
represent ideal conditions, yet conditions that are readily achievable in a modern factory.
If the machine tool is old and worn, process variability will likely be greater than the
ideal, and these tolerances would be difficult to maintain. On the other hand, newer
machine tools can achieve closer tolerances than those listed.
Tighter tolerances usually mean higher costs. For example, if the product designer
specifies a tolerance of 0.10 mm on a hole diameter of 6.0 mm, this tolerance could be
achieved by a drilling operation, according to Table 24.2. However, if the designer
specifies a tolerance of 0.025 mm, then an additional reaming operation is needed to
satisfy this tighter requirement. This is not to suggest that looser tolerances are always
good. It often happens that closer tolerances and lower variability in the machining of the
individual components will lead to fewer problems in assembly, final product testing, field
service, and customer acceptance. Although these costs are not always as easy to quantify
as direct manufacturing costs, they can nevertheless be significant. Tighter tolerances that
push a factory to achieve better control over its manufacturing processes may lead to
lower total operating costs for the company over the long run.

24.2.2 SURFACE FINISH IN MACHINING
Because machining is often the manufacturing process that determines the final geometry and dimensions of the part, it is also the process that determines the part’s surface
texture (Section 5.3.2). Table 24.2 lists typical surface roughness values that can be

achieved in various machining operations. These finishes should be readily achievable by
modern, well-maintained machine tools.
Let us examine how surface finish is determined in a machining operation. The
roughness of a machined surface depends on many factors that can be grouped as follows:
(1) geometric factors, (2) work material factors, and (3) vibration and machine tool factors.
Our discussion of surface finish in this section examines these factors and their effects.

Geometric Factors These are the machining parameters that determine the surface
geometry of a machined part. They include: (1) type of machining operation; (2) cutting
tool geometry, most importantly nose radius; and (3) feed. The surface geometry that
would result from these factors is referred to as the ‘‘ideal’’ or ‘‘theoretical’’ surface
roughness, which is the finish that would be obtained in the absence of work material,
vibration, and machine tool factors.
Type of operation refers to the machining process used to generate the surface. For
example, peripheral milling, facing milling, and shaping all produce a flat surface;
however, the surface geometry is different for each operation because of differences
in tool shape and the way the tool interacts with the surface. A sense of the differences
can be seen in Figure 5.14 showing various possible lays of a surface.
Tool geometry and feed combine to form the surface geometry. The shape of the
tool point is the important tool geometry factor. The effects can be seen for a single-point
tool in Figure 24.1. With the same feed, a larger nose radius causes the feed marks to be
less pronounced, thus leading to a better finish. If two feeds are compared with the same
nose radius, the larger feed increases the separation between feed marks, leading to an
increase in the value of ideal surface roughness. If feed rate is large enough and the nose
radius is small enough so that the end cutting edge participates in creating the new
surface, then the end cutting-edge angle will affect surface geometry. In this case, a higher
ECEA will result in a higher surface roughness value. In theory, a zero ECEA would yield
a perfectly smooth surface; however, imperfections in the tool, work material, and
machining process preclude achieving such an ideal finish.

Chapter 24/Economic and Product Design Considerations in Machining

The effects of nose radius and feed can be combined in an equation to predict the
ideal average roughness for a surface produced by a single-point tool. The equation
applies to operations such as turning, shaping, and planing
Ri ¼

f2
32NR

ð24:1Þ

where Ri ¼ theoretical arithmetic average surface roughness, mm (in); f ¼ feed, mm (in);
and NR ¼ nose radius on the tool point, mm (in).
The equation assumes that the nose radius is not zero and that feed and nose radius
will be the principal factors that determine the geometry of the surface. The values for Ri
will be in units of mm (in), which can be converted to mm (m-in). Eq. (24.1) can also be
used to estimate the ideal surface roughness in face milling with insert tooling, using f to
represent the chip load (feed per tooth).
Equation (24.1) assumes a sharp cutting tool. As the tool wears, the shape of the
cutting point changes, which is reflected in the geometry of the work surface. For slight
amounts of tool wear, the effect is not noticeable. However, when tool wear becomes
significant, especially nose radius wear, surface roughness deteriorates compared with
the ideal values given by the preceding equations.

Work Material Factors Achieving the ideal surface finish is not possible in most
machining operations because of factors related to the work material and its interaction
with the tool. Work material factors that affect finish include: (1) built-up edge effects—as
the BUE cyclically forms and breaks away, particles are deposited on the newly created
work surface, causing it to have a rough ‘‘sandpaper’’ texture; (2) damage to the surface
caused by the chip curling back into the work; (3) tearing of the work surface during chip
formation when machining ductile materials; (4) cracks in the surface caused by discontinuous chip formation when machining brittle materials; and (5) friction between the
tool flank and the newly generated work surface. These work material factors are influenced
by cutting speed and rake angle, such that an increase in cutting speed or rake angle
generally improves surface finish.
The work material factors usually cause the actual surface finish to be worse than
the ideal. An empirical ratio can be developed to convert the ideal roughness value into
an estimate of the actual surface roughness value. This ratio takes into account BUE
formation, tearing, and other factors. The value of the ratio depends on cutting speed as
well as work material. Figure 24.2 shows the ratio of actual to ideal surface roughness as a
function of speed for several classes of work material.
The procedure for predicting the actual surface roughness in a machining operation
is to compute the ideal surface roughness value and then multiply this value by the ratio
of actual to ideal roughness for the appropriate class of work material. This can be
summarized as
Ra ¼ rai Ri

ð24:2Þ

where Ra ¼ the estimated value of actual roughness; rai ¼ ratio of actual to ideal surface
finish from Figure 24.2, and Ri ¼ ideal roughness value from Eq. (24.1).

From the chart in Figure 24.2, the ratio of actual to ideal roughness for ductile metals at

operation would be (approximately)
Ra ¼ 1:25  1:6 ¼ 2:0 mm

Vibration and Machine Tool Factors These factors are related to the machine tool,
tooling, and setup in the operation. They include chatter or vibration in the machine tool
or cutting tool; deflections in the fixturing, often resulting in vibration; and backlash in
the feed mechanism, particularly on older machine tools. If these machine tool factors
can be minimized or eliminated, the surface roughness in machining will be determined
primarily by geometric and work material factors described in the preceding.
Chatter or vibration in a machining operation can result in pronounced waviness in
the work surface. When chatter occurs, a distinctive noise occurs that can be recognized
by any experienced machinist. Possible steps to reduce or eliminate vibration include:
(1) adding stiffness and/or damping to the setup, (2) operating at speeds that do not cause
cyclical forces whose frequency approaches the natural frequency of the machine tool
system, (3) reducing feeds and depths to reduce forces in cutting, and (4) changing the
cutter design to reduce forces. Workpiece geometry can sometimes play a role in chatter.
Thin cross sections tend to increase the likelihood of chatter, requiring additional
supports to alleviate the condition.

24.3

SELECTION OF CUTTING CONDITIONS
One of the practical problems in machining is selecting the proper cutting conditions for a
given operation. This is one of the tasks in process planning (Section 40.1). For each

E1C24

Chapter 24/Economic and Product Design Considerations in Machining

operation, decisions must be made about machine tool, cutting tool(s), and cutting
conditions. These decisions must give due consideration to workpart machinability, part
geometry, surface finish, and so forth.

24.3.1 SELECTING FEED AND DEPTH OF CUT
Cutting conditions in a machining operation consist of speed, feed, depth of cut, and
cutting fluid (whether a cutting fluid is to be used and, if so, type of cutting fluid). Tooling
considerations are usually the dominant factor in decisions about cutting fluids (Section
23.4). Depth of cut is often predetermined by workpiece geometry and operation
sequence. Many jobs require a series of roughing operations followed by a final finishing
operation. In the roughing operations, depth is made as large as possible within the
limitations of available horsepower, machine tool and setup rigidity, strength of the cutting
tool, and so on. In the finishing cut, depth is set to achieve the final dimensions for the part.
The problem then reduces to selection of feed and speed. In general, values of these
parameters should be decided in the order: feed first, speed second. Determining the
appropriate feed rate for a given machining operation depends on the following factors:
å Tooling. What type of tooling will be used? Harder tool materials (e.g., cemented
carbides, ceramics, etc.) tend to fracture more readily than high-speed steel. These
tools are normally used at lower feed rates. HSS can tolerate higher feeds because of
its greater toughness.
å Roughing or finishing. Roughing operations involve high feeds, typically 0.5 to 1.25
mm/rev (0.020 to 0.050 in/rev) for turning; finishing operations involve low feeds,
typically 0.125 to 0.4 mm/rev (0.005 to 0.015 in/rev) for turning.
å Constraints on feed in roughing. If the operation is roughing, how high can the feed
rate be set? To maximize metal removal rate, feed should be set as high as possible.
Upper limits on feed are imposed by cutting forces, setup rigidity, and sometimes
horsepower.
å Surface finish requirements in finishing. If the operation is finishing, what is the
desired surface finish? Feed is an important factor in surface finish, and computations
like those in Example 24.2 can be used to estimate the feed that will produce a desired
surface finish.

24.3.2 OPTIMIZING CUTTING SPEED
Selection of cutting speed is based on making the best use of the cutting tool, which
normally means choosing a speed that provides a high metal removal rate yet suitably
long tool life. Mathematical formulas have been derived to determine optimal cutting
speed for a machining operation, given that the various time and cost components of the
operation are known. The original derivation of these machining economics equations is
credited to W. Gilbert [10]. The formulas allow the optimal cutting speed to be calculated
for either of two objectives: (1) maximum production rate, or (2) minimum unit cost.
Both objectives seek to achieve a balance between material removal rate and tool life.
The formulas are based on a known Taylor tool life equation for the tool used in the
operation. Accordingly, feed, depth of cut, and work material have already been set. The
derivation will be illustrated for a turning operation. Similar derivations can be developed for other types of machining operations [3].

Maximizing Production Rate For maximum production rate, the speed that minimizes
machining time per workpiece is determined. Minimizing cutting time per unit is equivalent

E1C24

13:24:31

Page 593

Section 24.3/Selection of Cutting Conditions

593

to maximizing production rate. This objective is important in cases when the production
order must be completed as quickly as possible.
In turning, there are three time elements that contribute to the total production
cycle time for one part:
1. Part handling time Th. This is the time the operator spends loading the part into the
machine tool at the beginning of the production cycle and unloading the part after
machining is completed. Any additional time required to reposition the tool for the
start of the next cycle should also be included here.
2. Machining time Tm. This is the time the tool is actually engaged in machining during
the cycle.
3. Tool change time Tt. At the end of the tool life, the tool must be changed, which takes
time. This time must be apportioned over the number of parts cut during the tool life. Let
np ¼ the number of pieces cut in one tool life (the number of pieces cut with one cutting
edge until the tool is changed); thus, the tool change time per part ¼ Tt/np.
The sum of these three time elements gives the total time per unit product for the
operation cycle
Tt
Tc ¼ Th þ Tm þ
ð24:3Þ
np
where Tc ¼ production cycle time per piece, min; and the other terms are defined in the
preceding.
The cycle time Tc is a function of cutting speed. As cutting speed is increased, Tm
decreases and Tt/np increases; Th is unaffected by speed. These relationships are shown in
Figure 24.3.
The cycle time per part is minimized at a certain value of cutting speed. This
optimal speed can be identified by recasting Eq. (24.3) as a function of speed. Machining
time in a straight turning operation is given by previous Eq. (22.5)
Tm ¼

pDL
vf

where Tm ¼ machining time, min; D ¼ workpart diameter, mm (in); L ¼ workpart length,
mm (in); f ¼ feed, mm/rev (in/rev); and v ¼ cutting speed, mm/min for consistency of
units (in/min for consistency of units).

Minimizing Cost per Unit For minimum cost per unit, the speed that minimizes
production cost per piece for the operation is determined. To derive the equations for this
case, we begin with the four cost components that determine total cost of producing one
part during a turning operation:
1. Cost of part handling time. This is the cost of the time the operator spends loading
and unloading the part. Let Co ¼ the cost rate (e.g., $/min) for the operator and
machine. Thus the cost of part handling time ¼ CoTh.
2. Cost of machining time. This is the cost of the time the tool is engaged in machining.
Using Co again to represent the cost per minute of the operator and machine tool, the
cutting time cost ¼ CoTm.
3. Cost of tool change time. The cost of tool change time ¼ CoTt/np.
4. Tooling cost. In addition to the tool change time, the tool itself has a cost that must be
added to the total operation cost. This cost is the cost per cutting edge Ct, divided by the
number of pieces machined with that cutting edge np. Thus, tool cost per workpiece is given
by Ct/np.
Tooling cost requires an explanation, because it is affected by different tooling
situations. For disposable inserts (e.g., cemented carbide inserts), tool cost is determined as
Ct ¼

Section 24.3/Selection of Cutting Conditions

595

where Ct ¼ cost per cutting edge, $/tool life; Pt ¼ price of the insert, $/insert; and ne ¼
number of cutting edges per insert.
This depends on the insert type; for example, triangular inserts that can be used
only one side (positive rake tooling) have three edges/insert; if both sides of the insert can
be used (negative rake tooling), there are six edges/insert; and so forth.
For regrindable tooling (e.g., high-speed steel solid shank tools, brazed carbide
tools), the tool cost includes purchase price plus cost to regrind:
Ct ¼

Pt
þ T g Cg

ð24:10Þ

where Ct ¼ cost per tool life, $/tool life; Pt ¼ purchase price of the solid shank tool or brazed
insert, $/tool; ng ¼ number of tool lives per tool, which is the number of times the tool can be
ground before it can no longer be used (5 to 10 times for roughing tools and 10 to 20 times
for finishing tools); Tg ¼ time to grind or regrind the tool, min/tool life; and Cg ¼ grinder’s
rate, $/min.
The sum of the four cost components gives the total cost per unit product Cc for the
machining cycle:
Cc ¼ Co T h þ Co T m þ

Cc is a function of cutting speed, just as Tc is a function of v. The relationships for the
individual terms and total cost as a function of cutting speed are shown in Figure 24.4.

Note that production rate is greater for vmax and cost per piece is minimum for vmin. n

Some Comments on Machining Economics Some practical observations can be
made relative to these optimum cutting speed equations. First, as the values of C and n
increase in the Taylor tool life equation, the optimum cutting speed increases by either
Eq. (24.7) or Eq. (24.13). Cemented carbides and ceramic cutting tools should be used at
speeds that are significantly higher than for high-speed steel tools.
Second, as the tool change time and/or tooling cost (Ttc and Ct) increase, the cutting
speed equations yield lower values. Lower speeds allow the tools to last longer, and it is
wasteful to change tools too frequently if either the cost of tools or the time to change
them is high. An important effect of this tool cost factor is that disposable inserts usually
possess a substantial economic advantage over regrindable tooling. Even though the cost
per insert is significant, the number of edges per insert is large enough and the time
required to change the cutting edge is low enough that disposable tooling generally
achieves higher production rates and lower costs per unit product.
Third, vmax is always greater than vmin. The Ct/np term in Eq. (24.13) has the effect
of pushing the optimum speed value to the left in Figure 24.4, resulting in a lower value
than in Figure 24.3. Rather than taking the risk of cutting at a speed above vmax or below
vmin, some machine shops strive to operate in the interval between vmin and vmax—an
interval sometimes referred to as the ‘‘high-efficiency range.’’
The procedures outlined for selecting feeds and speeds in machining are often
difficult to apply in practice. The best feed rate is difficult to determine because the
relationships between feed and surface finish, force, horsepower, and other constraints
are not readily available for each machine tool. Experience, judgment, and experimentation are required to select the proper feed. The optimum cutting speed is difficult to
calculate because the Taylor equation parameters C and n are not usually known without
prior testing. Testing of this kind in a production environment is expensive.

24.4

PRODUCT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN MACHINING
Several important aspects of product design have already been considered in our
discussion of tolerance and surface finish (Section 24.2). In this section, we present
some design guidelines for machining, compiled from sources [1], [5], and [15]:
å If possible, parts should be designed that do not need machining. If this is not
possible, then minimize the amount of machining required on the parts. In general, a
lower-cost product is achieved through the use of net shape processes such as
precision casting, closed die forging, or (plastic) molding; or near net shape processes
such as impression die forging. Reasons why machining may be required include
close tolerances; good surface finish; and special geometric features such as threads,
precision holes, cylindrical sections with high degree of roundness, and similar shapes
that cannot be achieved except by machining.

Chapter 24/Economic and Product Design Considerations in Machining

å Tolerances should be specified to satisfy functional requirements, but process
capabilities should also be considered. See Table 24.2 for tolerance capabilities in
machining. Excessively close tolerances add cost but may not add value to the part.
As tolerances become tighter (smaller), product costs generally increase because of
additional processing, fixturing, inspection, sortation, rework, and scrap.
å Surface finish should be specified to meet functional and/or aesthetic requirements,
but better finishes generally increase processing costs by requiring additional
operations such as grinding or lapping.
å Machined features such as sharp corners, edges, and points should be avoided; they
are often difficult to accomplish by machining. Sharp internal corners require pointed
cutting tools that tend to break during machining. Sharp external corners and edges
tend to create burrs and are dangerous to handle.
å Deep holes that must be bored should be avoided. Deep hole boring requires a long
boring bar. Boring bars must be stiff, and this often requires use of high modulus
materials such as cemented carbide, which is expensive.
å Machined parts should be designed so they can be produced from standard available
stock. Choose exterior dimensions equal to or close to the standard stock size to
minimize machining; for example, rotational parts with outside diameters that are
equal to standard bar stock diameters.
å Parts should be designed to be rigid enough to withstand forces of cutting and
workholder clamping. Machining of long narrow parts, large flat parts, parts with thin
walls, and similar shapes should be avoided if possible.
å Undercuts as in Figure 24.5 should be avoided because they often require additional
setups and operations and/or special tooling; they can also lead to stress concentrations in service.
å Materials with good machinability should be selected by the designer (Section 24.1).
As a rough guide, the machinability rating of a material correlates with the allowable
cutting speed and production rate that can be used. Thus, parts made of materials
with low machinability cost more to produce. Parts that are hardened by heat
treatment must usually be finish ground or machined with higher cost tools after
hardening to achieve final size and tolerance.
å Machined parts should be designed with features that can be produced in a minimum
number of setups—one setup if possible. This usually means geometric features that
can be accessed from one side of the part (see Figure 24.6).

parts with undercuts: cross
sections of (a) bracket and (b) rotational part. Also shown is how the
part design might be improved.

å Machined parts should be designed with features that can be achieved with standard
cutting tools. This means avoiding unusual hole sizes, threads, and features with
unusual shapes requiring special form tools. In addition, it is helpful to design parts
such that the number of individual cutting tools needed in machining is minimized;
this often allows the part to be completed in one setup on a machine such as a
machining center (Section 22.5).

PROBLEMS
Machinability
24.1. A machinability rating is to be determined for a
new work material using the cutting speed for a 60min tool life as the basis of comparison. For the
base material (B1112 steel), test data resulted in
Taylor equation parameter values of n ¼ 0.29 and

C ¼ 500, where speed is in m/min and tool life is
min. For the new material, the parameter values
were n ¼ 0.21 and C ¼ 400. These results were
obtained using cemented carbide tooling. (a) Compute a machinability rating for the new material.

Problems
(b) Suppose the machinability criterion were the
cutting speed for a 10-min tool life rather than the
present criterion. Compute the machinability rating for this case. (c) What do the results of the two
calculations show about the difficulties in machinability measurement?
24.2. A small company uses a band saw to cut through 2inch metal bar stock. A material supplier is pushing
a new material that is supposed to be more machinable while providing similar mechanical properties. The company does not have access to
sophisticated measuring devices, but they do
have a stopwatch. They have acquired a sample
of the new material and cut both the present
material and the new material with the same
band saw settings. In the process, they measured
how long it took to cut through each material. To
cut through the present material, it took an average
of 2 minutes, 20 seconds. To cut through the new
material, it took an average of 2 minutes, 6 seconds.
(a) Develop a machinability rating system based on
time to cut through the 2.0-inch bar stock, using the
present material as the base material. (b) Using
your rating system, determine the machinability
rating for the new material.
24.3. A machinability rating is to be determined for a
new work material. For the base material (B1112),

601

test data resulted in a Taylor equation with parameters n ¼ 0.29 and C ¼ 490. For the new material,
the Taylor parameters were n ¼ 0.23 and C ¼ 430.
Units in both cases are: speed in m/min and tool life
in min. These results were obtained using
cemented carbide tooling. (a) Compute a machinability rating for the new material using cutting
speed for a 30-min tool life as the basis of comparison. (b) If the machinability criterion were tool life
for a cutting speed of 150 m/min, what is the
machinability rating for the new material?
24.4. Tool life turning tests have been conducted on
B1112 steel with high-speed steel tooling, and
the resulting parameters of the Taylor equation
are: n ¼ 0.13 and C ¼ 225. B1112 is the base metal
and has a machinability rating ¼ 1.00 (100%).
During the tests, feed ¼ 0.010 in/rev, and depth
of cut ¼ 0.100 in. Based on this information, and
machinability data given in Table 24.1, determine
the cutting speed you would recommend for the
following work materials, if the tool life desired
in operation is 30 min (the same feed and depth of
cut are to be used): (a) C1008 low carbon steel with
150 Brinell hardness, (b) 4130 alloy steel with 190
Brinell hardness, and (c) B1113 steel with 170
Brinell hardness.

Surface Roughness
24.5. In a turning operation on cast iron, the nose radius on
the tool ¼ 1.5 mm, feed ¼ 0.22 mm/rev, and speed ¼
1.8 m/s. Compute an estimate of the surface roughness for this cut.
24.6. A turning operation uses a 2/64 in nose radius
cutting tool on a free machining steel with a feed
rate ¼ 0.010 in/rev and a cutting speed ¼ 300 ft/min.
Determine the surface roughness for this cut.
24.7. A single-point HSS tool with a 3/64 in nose radius is
used in a shaping operation on a ductile steel workpart. The cutting speed is 120 ft/min. The feed is
0.014 in/pass and depth of cut is 0.135 in. Determine
the surface roughness for this operation.
24.8. A part to be turned in an engine lathe must have a
surface finish of 1.6 mm. The part is made of a freemachining aluminum alloy. Cutting speed ¼ 150 m/
min, and depth of cut ¼ 4.0 mm. The nose radius on
the tool ¼ 0.75 mm. Determine the feed that will
achieve the specified surface finish.
24.9. Solve previous Problem 24.8 except that the part is
made of cast iron instead of aluminum and the
cutting speed is reduced to 100 m/min.
24.10. A part to be turned in an engine lathe must have a
surface finish of 1.5 mm. The part is made of aluminum. The cutting speed is 1.5 m/s and the depth is 3.0

mm. The nose radius on the tool ¼ 1.0 mm. Determine the feed that will achieve the specified surface
finish.
24.11. The surface finish specification in a turning job is
0.8 mm. The work material is cast iron. Cutting
speed ¼ 75 m/min, feed ¼ 0.3 mm/rev, and depth of
cut ¼ 4.0 mm. The nose radius of the cutting tool
must be selected. Determine the minimum nose
radius that will obtain the specified finish in this
operation.
24.12. A face milling operation is to be performed on a
cast iron part to finish the surface to 36 m-in. The
cutter uses four inserts and its diameter is 3.0 in.
The cutter rotates at 475 rev/min. To obtain the
best possible finish, a type of carbide insert with 4/
64 in nose radius is to be used. Determine the
required feed rate (in/min) that will achieve the
36 m-in finish.
24.13. A face milling operation is not yielding the required surface finish on the work. The cutter is a
four-tooth insert type face milling cutter. The machine shop foreman thinks the problem is that the
work material is too ductile for the job, but this
property tests well within the ductility range for the
material specified by the designer. Without

machine shop: disposable inserts and brazed inserts. The parameters in the Taylor equation for
this grade are: n ¼ 0.25 and C ¼ 300 (m/min) under
the cutting conditions considered here. For the
disposable inserts, price of each insert ¼ $6, there
are four cutting edges per insert, and the tool
change time ¼ 1.0 min (this is an average of the
time to index the insert and the time to replace it
when all edges have been used). For the brazed
insert, the price of the tool ¼ $30 and it is estimated
that it can be used a total of 15 times before it must
be scrapped. The tool change time for the regrindable tooling ¼ 3.0 min. The standard time to grind
or regrind the cutting edge is 5.0 min, and the
grinder is paid at a rate ¼ $20/hr. Machine time
on the lathe costs $24/hr. The workpart to be used

rate.
Three tool materials are to be compared for the
same finish turning operation on a batch of 150
steel parts: high-speed steel, cemented carbide, and
ceramic. For the high-speed steel tool, the Taylor
equation parameters are: n ¼ 0.130 and C ¼ 80 (m/
min). The price of the HSS tool is $20 and it is
estimated that it can be ground and reground 15
times at a cost of $2 per grind. Tool change time is 3
min. Both carbide and ceramic tools are in insert
form and can be held in the same mechanical
toolholder. The Taylor equation parameters for
the cemented carbide are: n ¼ 0.30 and C ¼ 650
(m/min); and for the ceramic: n ¼ 0.6 and C ¼ 3,500
(m/min). The cost per insert for the carbide is $8
and for the ceramic is $10. There are six cutting
edges per insert in both cases. Tool change time is
1.0 min for both tools. The time to change a part is
2.5 min. The feed is 0.30 mm/rev, and depth of cut is
3.5 mm. The cost of machine time is $40/hr. The
part is 73.0 mm in diameter and 250 mm in length.
Setup time for the batch is 2.0 hr. For the three
tooling cases, compare: (a) cutting speeds for minimum cost, (b) tool lives, (c) cycle time, (d) cost per
production unit, (e) total time to complete the
batch and production rate. (f) What is the proportion of time spent actually cutting metal for each
tooling? Use of a spreadsheet calculator is
recommended.
Solve Problem 24.21 except that in parts (a) and (b)
determine the cutting speeds and tool lives for
maximum production rate. Use of a spreadsheet
calculator is recommended.
A vertical boring mill is used to bore the inside
diameter of a large batch of tube-shaped parts. The
diameter ¼ 28.0 in and the length of the bore ¼ 14.0
in. Current cutting conditions are: speed ¼ 200 ft/min,
feed ¼ 0.015 in/rev, and depth ¼ 0.125 in. The
parameters of the Taylor equation for the cutting
tool in the operation are: n ¼ 0.23 and C ¼ 850 (ft/

min). Tool change time ¼ 3.0 min, and tooling cost ¼
$3.50 per cutting edge. The time required to load and
unload the parts ¼ 12.0 min, and the cost of machine
time on this boring mill ¼ $42/hr. Management has
decreed that the production rate must be increased by
25%. Is that possible? Assume that feed must remain
unchanged to achieve the required surface finish.
What is the current production rate and the maximum
possible production rate for this job?
24.24. An NC lathe cuts two passes across a cylindrical
workpiece under automatic cycle. The operator
loads and unloads the machine. The starting diameter of the work is 3.00 in and its length ¼ 10 in. The
work cycle consists of the following steps (with
element times given in parentheses where applicable): (1) Operator loads part into machine, starts
cycle (1.00 min); (2) NC lathe positions tool for first
pass (0.10 min); (3) NC lathe turns first pass (time
depends on cutting speed); (4) NC lathe repositions
tool for second pass (0.4 min); (5) NC lathe turns
second pass (time depends on cutting speed); and
(6) Operator unloads part and places in tote pan
(1.00 min). In addition, the cutting tool must be
periodically changed. This tool change time takes
1.00 min. The feed rate ¼ 0.007 in/rev and the depth
of cut for each pass ¼ 0.100 in. The cost of the
operator and machine ¼ $39/hr and the tool cost ¼
$2/cutting edge. The applicable Taylor tool life
equation has parameters: n ¼ 0.26 and C ¼ 900
(ft/min). Determine (a) the cutting speed for minimum cost per piece, (b) the average time required
to complete one production cycle, (c) cost of the
production cycle. (d) If the setup time for this job is
3.0 hours and the batch size ¼ 300 parts, how long
will it take to complete the batch?
24.25. As indicated in Section 23.4, the effect of a cutting
fluid is to increase the value of C in the Taylor tool
life equation. In a certain machining situation using
HSS tooling, the C value is increased from C ¼ 200
to C ¼ 225 owing to the use of the cutting fluid. The
n value is the same with or without fluid at n ¼
0.125. Cutting speed used in the operation is v ¼
125 ft/min. Feed ¼ 0.010 in/rev and depth ¼ 0.100
in. The effect of the cutting fluid can be to either

increase tool life (at the same cutting speed). (a)
What is the cutting speed that would result from
using the cutting fluid if tool life remains the same
as with no fluid? (b) What is the tool life that would
result if the cutting speed remained at 125 ft/min?
(c) Economically, which effect is better, given that
tooling cost ¼ $2 per cutting edge, tool change time
¼ 2.5 min, and operator and machine rate ¼ $30/
hr? Justify you answer with calculations, using cost
per cubic in of metal machined as the criterion of
comparison. Ignore effects of workpart handling
time.
In a turning operation on ductile steel, it is desired
to obtain an actual surface roughness of 63 m-in
with a 2/64 in nose radius tool. The ideal roughness
is given by Eq. (24.1) and an adjustment will have
to be made using Figure 24.2 to convert the 63 m-in
actual roughness to an ideal roughness, taking into
account the material and cutting speed. Disposable
inserts are used at a cost of $1.75 per cutting edge
(each insert costs $7 and there are four edges per
insert). Average time to change each insert ¼ 1.0
min. The workpiece length ¼ 30.0 in and its diameter ¼ 3.5 in. The machine and operator’s rate ¼ $39
per hour including applicable overheads. The Taylor tool life equation for this tool and work combination is given by: vT0.23f0.55 ¼ 40.75, where T ¼
tool life, min; v ¼ cutting speed, ft/min; and f ¼
feed, in/rev. Solve for (a) the feed in in/rev that will
achieve the desired actual finish, (b) cutting speed
for minimum cost per piece at the feed determined
in (a). Hint: To solve (a) and (b) requires an
iterative computational procedure. Use of a
spreadsheet calculator is recommended for this
iterative procedure.
Solve Problem 24.26 only using maximum production rate as the objective rather than minimum
piece cost. Use of a spreadsheet calculator is
recommended.

Abrasive machining involves material removal by the action
of hard, abrasive particles that are usually in the form of a
bonded wheel. Grinding is the most important abrasive
process. In terms of number of machine tools in use, grinding
is the most common of all metalworking operations [11].
Other traditional abrasive processes include honing, lapping,
superfinishing, polishing, and buffing. The abrasive machining processes are generally used as finishing operations,
although some abrasive processes are capable of high material removal rates rivaling those of conventional machining
operations.
The use of abrasives to shape parts is probably the
oldest material removal process (Historical Note 25.1).
Abrasive processes are important commercially and technologically for the following reasons:
å They can be used on all types of materials ranging from
soft metals to hardened steels and hard nonmetallic
materials such as ceramics and silicon.
å Some of these processes can produce extremely fine
surface finishes, to 0.025 mm (1 m-in).
å For certain abrasive processes, dimensions can be held
to extremely close tolerances.
Abrasive water jet cutting and ultrasonic machining are
also abrasive processes, because material removal is accomplished by means of abrasives. However, they are commonly
classified as nontraditional processes and are covered in the
following chapter.

25.1

GRINDING

Grinding is a material removal process accomplished by
abrasive particles that are contained in a bonded grinding
wheel rotating at very high surface speeds. The grinding
wheel is usually disk-shaped, and is precisely balanced for

Development of abrasive processes

U

se of abrasives predates any of the other machining
operations. There is archaeological evidence that ancient
people used abrasive stones such as sandstone found in
nature to sharpen tools and weapons and scrape away
unwanted portions of softer materials to make domestic
implements.
Grinding became an important technical trade in
ancient Egypt. The large stones used to build the Egyptian
pyramids were cut to size by a rudimentary grinding
process. The grinding of metals dates to around 2000 BCE
and was a highly valued skill at that time.
Early abrasive materials were those found in nature,
such as sandstone, which consists primarily of quartz
(SiO2); emery, consisting of corundum (Al2O3) plus equal
or lesser amounts of the iron minerals hematite (Fe2O3)
and magnetite (Fe3O4); and diamond. The first grinding
wheels were likely cut out of sandstone and were no
doubt rotated under manual power. However, grinding
wheels made in this way were not consistent in quality.
In the early 1800s, the first solid bonded grinding
wheels were produced in India. They were used to grind
gems, an important trade in India at the time. The
abrasives were corundum, emery, or diamond. The
bonding material was natural gum-resin shellac. The
technology was exported to Europe and the United
States, and other bonding materials were subsequently
introduced: rubber bond in the mid-1800s, vitrified bond

around 1870, shellac bond around 1880, and resinoid
bond in the 1920s with the development of the first
thermosetting plastics (phenol-formaldehyde).
In the late 1800s, synthetic abrasives were first
produced: silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide
(Al2O3). By manufacturing the abrasives, chemistry and
size of the individual abrasive grains could be controlled
more closely, resulting in higher quality grinding wheels.
The first real grinding machines were made by the
U.S. firm Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s for grinding parts
for sewing machines, an important industry during the
period. Grinding machines also contributed to the
development of the bicycle industry in the 1890s and
later the U.S. automobile industry. The grinding process
was used to size and finish heat-treated (hardened) parts
in these products.
The superabrasives diamond and cubic boron nitride
are products of the twentieth century. Synthetic
diamonds were first produced by the General Electric
Company in 1955. These abrasives were used to grind
cemented carbide cutting tools, and today this remains
one of the important applications of diamond abrasives.
Cubic boron nitride (cBN), second only to diamond in
hardness, was first synthesized in 1957 by GE using a
similar process to that for making artificial diamonds.
Cubic BN has become an important abrasive for grinding
hardened steels.

high rotational speeds. The reader can see grinding in action in our video clip titled Basics
of Grinding.
VIDEO CLIP
Basics of Grinding. This clip contains four segments: (1) CNC grinding, (2) grinding
wheel ring testing, (3) wheel dressing, and (4) grinding fluids.

Grinding can be likened to the milling process. Cutting occurs on either the
periphery or the face of the grinding wheel, similar to peripheral and face milling.
Peripheral grinding is much more common than face grinding. The rotating grinding
wheel consists of many cutting teeth (the abrasive particles), and the work is fed relative
to the wheel to accomplish material removal. Despite these similarities, there are
significant differences between grinding and milling: (1) the abrasive grains in the wheel
are much smaller and more numerous than the teeth on a milling cutter; (2) cutting speeds
in grinding are much higher than in milling; (3) the abrasive grits in a grinding wheel are
randomly oriented and possess on average a very high negative rake angle; and (4) a
grinding wheel is self-sharpening—as the wheel wears, the abrasive particles become dull
and either fracture to create fresh cutting edges or are pulled out of the surface of the
wheel to expose new grains.

Chapter 25/Grinding and Other Abrasive Processes

25.1.1 THE GRINDING WHEEL
A grinding wheel consists of abrasive particles and bonding material. The bonding material
holds the particles in place and establishes the shape and structure of the wheel. These two
ingredients and the way they are fabricated determine the five basic parameters of a
grinding wheel: (1) abrasive material, (2) grain size, (3) bonding material, (4) wheel grade,
and (5) wheel structure. To achieve the desired performance in a given application, each of
the parameters must be carefully selected.
Abrasive Material Different abrasive materials are appropriate for grinding different
work materials. General properties of an abrasive material used in grinding wheels include
high hardness, wear resistance, toughness, and friability. Hardness, wear resistance, and
toughness are desirable properties of any cutting-tool material. Friability refers to the
capacity of the abrasive material to fracture when the cutting edge of the grain becomes
dull, thereby exposing a new sharp edge.
The development of grinding abrasives is described in our historical note. Today, the
abrasive materials of greatest commercial importance are aluminum oxide, silicon carbide,
cubic boron nitride, and diamond. They are briefly described in Table 25.1, together with
their relative hardness values.
Grain Size The grain size of the abrasive particle is important in determining surface
finish and material removal rate. Small grit sizes produce better finishes, whereas larger
grain sizes permit larger material removal rates. Thus, a choice must be made between these
two objectives when selecting abrasive grain size. The selection of grit size also depends to
some extent on the hardness of the work material. Harder work materials require smaller
grain sizes to cut effectively, whereas softer materials require larger grit sizes.
The grit size is measured using a screen mesh procedure, as explained in Section 16.1.
In this procedure, smaller grit sizes have larger numbers and vice versa. Grain sizes used in
grinding wheels typically range between 8 and 250. Grit size 8 is very coarse and size 250 is
very fine. Even finer grit sizes are used for lapping and superfinishing (Section 25.2).
Bonding Materials The bonding material holds the abrasive grains and establishes the
shape and structural integrity of the grinding wheel. Desirable properties of the bond

Description

Aluminum oxide (Al2O3)

Most common abrasive material (Section 7.3.1), used to grind steel
and other ferrous, high-strength alloys.
Harder than Al2O3, but not as tough (Section 7.2). Applications
include ductile metals such as aluminum, brass, and stainless steel,
as well as brittle materials such as some cast irons and certain
ceramics. Cannot be used effectively for grinding steel because of
the strong chemical affinity between the carbon in SiC and the iron
in steel.
When used as an abrasive, cBN (Section 7.3.3) is produced under
the trade name Borazon by the General Electric Company. cBN
grinding wheels are used for hard materials such as hardened tool
steels and aerospace alloys.
Diamond abrasives occur naturally and are also made synthetically
(Section 7.5.1). Diamond wheels are generally used in grinding
applications on hard, abrasive materials such as ceramics, cemented
carbides, and glass.

Bonding Material Description
Vitrified bond

Silicate bond

Rubber bond
Resinoid bond

Shellac bond
Metallic bond

Consists chiefly of baked clay and ceramic materials. Most grinding
wheels in common use are vitrified bonded wheels. They are strong
and rigid, resistant to elevated temperatures, and relatively
unaffected by water and oil that might be used in grinding fluids.
Consists of sodium silicate (Na2SO3). Applications are generally
limited to situations in which heat generation must be minimized,
such as grinding cutting tools.
Most flexible of the bonding materials and used as a bonding
material in cutoff wheels.
Consists of various thermosetting resin materials, such as phenolformaldehyde. It has very high strength and is used for rough
grinding and cutoff operations.
Relatively strong but not rigid; often used in applications requiring a
good finish.
Metal, usually bronze, is the common bond material for diamond and
cBN grinding wheels. Particulate processing (Chapters 16 and 17) is
used to bond the metal matrix and abrasive grains to the outside
periphery of the wheel, thus conserving the costly abrasive materials.

material include strength, toughness, hardness, and temperature resistance. The bonding
material must be able to withstand the centrifugal forces and high temperatures experienced by the grinding wheel, resist shattering in shock loading of the wheel, and hold the
abrasive grains rigidly in place to accomplish the cutting action while allowing those grains
that are worn to be dislodged so that new grains can be exposed. Bonding materials
commonly used in grinding wheels are identified and briefly described in Table 25.2.
Wheel Structure and Wheel Grade Wheel structure refers to the relative spacing of
the abrasive grains in the wheel. In addition to the abrasive grains and bond material,
grinding wheels contain air gaps or pores, as illustrated in Figure 25.1. The volumetric
proportions of grains, bond material, and pores can be expressed as
Pg þ Pb þ Pp ¼ 1:0

ð25:1Þ

where Pg ¼ proportion of abrasive grains in the total wheel volume, Pb ¼ proportion of
bond material, and Pp ¼ proportion of pores (air gaps).
Wheel structure is measured on a scale that ranges between ‘‘open’’ and ‘‘dense.’’ An
open structure is one in which Pp is relatively large, and Pg is relatively small. That is, there
are more pores and fewer grains per unit volume in a wheel of open structure. By contrast, a

dense structure is one in which Pp is relatively small, and Pg is larger. Generally, open
structures are recommended in situations in which clearance for chips must be provided.
Dense structures are used to obtain better surface finish and dimensional control.
Wheel grade indicates the grinding wheel’s bond strength in retaining the abrasive
grits during cutting. This is largely dependent on the amount of bonding material present
in the wheel structure—Pb in Eq. (25.1). Grade is measured on a scale that ranges
between soft and hard. ‘‘Soft’’ wheels lose grains readily, whereas ‘‘hard’’ wheels retain
their abrasive grains. Soft wheels are generally used for applications requiring low
material removal rates and grinding of hard work materials. Hard wheels are typically
used to achieve high stock removal rates and for grinding of relative soft work materials.
Grinding Wheel Specification The preceding parameters can be concisely designated
in a standard grinding wheel marking system defined by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) [3]. This marking system uses numbers and letters to specify
abrasive type, grit size, grade, structure, and bond material. Table 25.3 presents an
abbreviated version of the ANSI Standard, indicating how the numbers and letters are
interpreted. The standard also provides for additional identifications that might be used
by the grinding wheel manufacturers. The ANSI Standard for diamond and cubic boron
nitride grinding wheels is slightly different than for conventional wheels. The marking
system for these newer grinding wheels is presented in Table 25.4.

Grinding wheels come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as shown in Figure 25.2.
Configurations (a), (b), and (c) are peripheral grinding wheels, in which material removal is
accomplished by the outside circumference of the wheel. A typical abrasive cutoff wheel is
shown in (d), which also involves peripheral cutting. Wheels (e), (f), and (g) are face
grinding wheels, in which the flat face of the wheel removes material from the work surface.

25.1.2 ANALYSIS OF THE GRINDING PROCESS
The cutting conditions in grinding are characterized by very high speeds and very small
cut size, compared to milling and other traditional machining operations. Using surface
grinding to illustrate, Figure 25.3(a) shows the principal features of the process. The
peripheral speed of the grinding wheel is determined by the rotational speed of the wheel:
v ¼ pDN

shape and (c) cross section of a single chip.

where v ¼ surface speed of wheel, m/min (ft/min); N ¼ spindle speed, rev/min; and D ¼
wheel diameter, m (ft).
Depth of cut d, called the infeed, is the penetration of the wheel below the original
work surface. As the operation proceeds, the grinding wheel is fed laterally across the
surface on each pass by the work. This is called the crossfeed, and it determines the width
of the grinding path w in Figure 25.3(a). This width, multiplied by depth d determines the
cross-sectional area of the cut. In most grinding operations, the work moves past the
wheel at a certain speed vw, so that the material removal rate is
RMR ¼ vw wd

ð25:3Þ

Each grain in the grinding wheel cuts an individual chip whose longitudinal shape
before cutting is shown in Figure 25.3(b) and whose assumed cross-sectional shape is
triangular, as in Figure 25.3(c). At the exit point of the grit from the work, where the chip
cross section is largest, this triangle has height t and width w0.
In a grinding operation, we are interested in how the cutting conditions combine
with the grinding wheel parameters to affect (1) surface finish, (2) forces and energy,
(3) temperature of the work surface, and (4) wheel wear.
Surface Finish Most commercial grinding is performed to achieve a surface finish that is
superior to that which can be accomplished with conventional machining. The surface finish
of the workpart is affected by the size of the individual chips formed during grinding. One
obvious factor in determining chip size is grit size—smaller grit sizes yield better finishes.
Let us examine the dimensions of an individual chip. From the geometry of the
grinding process in Figure 25.3, it can be shown that the average length of a chip is given by
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ð25:4Þ
lc ¼ Dd
where lc is the length of the chip, mm (in); D ¼ wheel diameter, mm (in); and d ¼ depth of
cut, or infeed, mm (in).

Page 611

Section 25.1/Grinding

611

This assumes the chip is formed by a grit that acts throughout the entire sweep arc
shown in the diagram.
Figure 25.3(c) shows the assumed cross section of a chip in grinding. The crosssectional shape is triangular with width w0 being greater than the thickness t by a factor
called the grain aspect ratio rg, defined by
rg ¼

w0
t

ð25:5Þ

Typical values of grain aspect ratio are between 10 and 20.
The number of active grits (cutting teeth) per square inch on the outside periphery
of the grinding wheel is denoted by C. In general, smaller grain sizes give larger C values.
C is also related to the wheel structure. A denser structure means more grits per area.
Based on the value of C, the number of chips formed per time nc is given by
nc ¼ vwC

ð25:6Þ

where v ¼ wheel speed, mm/min (in/min); w ¼ crossfeed, mm (in); and C ¼ grits per area
on the grinding wheel surface, grits/mm2 (grits/in2).
It stands to reason that surface finish will be improved by increasing the number of
chips formed per unit time on the work surface for a given width w. Therefore, according
to Eq. (25.6), increasing v and/or C will improve finish.
Forces and Energy If the force required to drive the work past the grinding wheel were
known, the specific energy in grinding could be determined as
U¼

F cv
vw wd

ð25:7Þ

where U ¼ specific energy, J/mm3 (in-lb/in3); Fc ¼ cutting force, which is the force to drive
the work past the wheel, N (lb); v ¼ wheel speed, m/min (ft/min); vw ¼ work speed, mm/
min (in/min); w ¼ width of cut, mm (in); and d ¼ depth of cut, mm (in).
In grinding, the specific energy is much greater than in conventional machining.
There are several reasons for this. First is the size effect in machining. As discussed, the
chip thickness in grinding is much smaller than for other machining operations, such as
milling. According to the size effect (Section 21.4), the small chip sizes in grinding cause
the energy required to remove each unit volume of material to be significantly higher
than in conventional machining—roughly 10 times higher.
Second, the individual grains in a grinding wheel possess extremely negative rake
angles. The average rake angle is about –30 , with values on some individual grains believed
to be as low as –60 . These very low rake angles result in low values of shear plane angle and
high shear strains, both of which mean higher energy levels in grinding.
Third, specific energy is higher in grinding because not all of the individual grits are
engaged in actual cutting. Because of the random positions and orientations of the grains in
the wheel, some grains do not project far enough into the work surface to accomplish cutting.
Three types of grain actions can be recognized, as illustrated in Figure 25.4: (a) cutting, in
which the grit projects far enough into the work surface to form a chip and remove
material; (b) plowing, in which the grit projects into the work, but not far enough to cause
cutting; instead, the work surface is deformed and energy is consumed without any
material removal; and (c) rubbing, in which the grit contacts the surface during its sweep,
but only rubbing friction occurs, thus consuming energy without removing any material.
The size effect, negative rake angles, and ineffective grain actions combine to make the
grinding process inefficient in terms of energy consumption per volume of material removed.
Using the specific energy relationship in Eq. (25.7), and assuming that the cutting
force acting on a single grain in the grinding wheel is proportional to rgt, it can be

ð25:8Þ

where F0 c is the cutting force acting on an individual grain, K1 is a constant of proportionality that depends on the strength of the material being cut and the sharpness of the
individual grain, and the other terms have been previously defined.
The practical significance of this relationship is that F0 c affects whether an individual
grain will be pulled out of the grinding wheel, an important factor in the wheel’s capacity to
‘‘resharpen’’ itself. Referring back to our discussion on wheel grade, a hard wheel can be
made to appear softer by increasing the cutting force acting on an individual grain through
appropriate adjustments in vw, v, and d, according to Eq. (25.8).
Temperatures at the Work Surface Because of the size effect, high negative rake
angles, and plowing and rubbing of the abrasive grits against the work surface, the grinding
process is characterized by high temperatures. Unlike conventional machining operations
in which most of the heat energy generated in the process is carried off in the chip, much of
the energy in grinding remains in the ground surface [11], resulting in high work surface
temperatures. The high surface temperatures have several possible damaging effects,
primarily surface burns and cracks. The burn marks show themselves as discolorations
on the surface caused by oxidation. Grinding burns are often a sign of metallurgical damage
immediately beneath the surface. The surface cracks are perpendicular to the wheel speed
direction. They indicate an extreme case of thermal damage to the work surface.
A second harmful thermal effect is softening of the work surface. Many grinding
operations are carried out on parts that have been heat-treated to obtain high hardness.
High grinding temperatures can cause the surface to lose some of its hardness. Third,
thermal effects in grinding can cause residual stresses in the work surface, possibly
decreasing the fatigue strength of the part.
It is important to understand what factors influence work surface temperatures in
grinding. Experimentally, it has been observed that surface temperature is dependent on
energy per surface area ground (closely related to specific energy U). Because this varies
inversely with chip thickness, it can be shown that surface temperature Ts is related to
grinding parameters as follows [10]:

0:5
0:75 rg Cv
D0:25
ð25:9Þ
T s ¼ K2 d

where K2 ¼ a constant of proportionality.
The practical implication of this relationship is that surface damage owing to high
work temperatures can be mitigated by decreasing depth of cut d, wheel speed v, and

number of active grits per square inch on the grinding wheel C, or by increasing work
speed vw. In addition, dull grinding wheels and wheels that have a hard grade and dense
structure tend to cause thermal problems. Of course, using a cutting fluid can also reduce
grinding temperatures.
Wheel Wear Grinding wheels wear, just as conventional cutting tools wear. Three
mechanisms are recognized as the principal causes of wear in grinding wheels: (1) grain
fracture, (2) attritious wear, and (3) bond fracture. Grain fracture occurs when a portion
of the grain breaks off, but the rest of the grain remains bonded in the wheel. The edges of
the fractured area become new cutting edges on the grinding wheel. The tendency of the
grain to fracture is called friability. High friability means that the grains fracture more
readily because of the cutting forces on the grains Fc0 .
Attritious wear involves dulling of the individual grains, resulting in flat spots and
rounded edges. Attritious wear is analogous to tool wear in a conventional cutting tool. It
is caused by similar physical mechanisms including friction and diffusion, as well as
chemical reactions between the abrasive material and the work material in the presence
of very high temperatures.
Bond fracture occurs when the individual grains are pulled out of the bonding material.
The tendency toward this mechanism depends on wheel grade, among other factors. Bond
fracture usually occurs because the grain has become dull because of attritious wear, and the
resulting cutting force is excessive. Sharp grains cut more efficiently with lower cutting forces;
hence, they remain attached in the bond structure.
The three mechanisms combine to cause the grinding wheel to wear as depicted in
Figure 25.5. Three wear regions can be identified. In the first region, the grains are initially
sharp, and wear is accelerated because of grain fracture. This corresponds to the ‘‘break-in’’
period in conventional tool wear. In the second region, the wear rate is fairly constant,
resulting in a linear relationship between wheel wear and volume of metal removed. This
region is characterized by attritious wear, with some grain and bond fracture. In the third
region of the wheel wear curve, the grains become dull, and the amount of plowing and
rubbing increases relative to cutting. In addition, some of the chips become clogged in the
pores of the wheel. This is called wheel loading, and it impairs the cutting action and leads to
higher heat and work surface temperatures. As a consequence, grinding efficiency decreases,
and the volume of wheel removed increases relative to the volume of metal removed.
The grinding ratio is a term used to indicate the slope of the wheel wear curve.

ratio and surface finish as
a function of wheel
speed. (Based on data in
Krabacher [14].)

The grinding ratio has the most significance in the linear wear region of Figure 25.5.
Typical values of GR range between 95 and 125 [5], which is about five orders of
magnitude less than the analogous ratio in conventional machining. Grinding ratio is
generally increased by increasing wheel speed v. The reason for this is that the size of the
chip formed by each grit is smaller with higher speeds, so the amount of grain fracture is
reduced. Because higher wheel speeds also improve surface finish, there is a general
advantage in operating at high grinding speeds. However, when speeds become too high,
attritious wear and surface temperatures increase. As a result, the grinding ratio is reduced
and the surface finish is impaired. This effect was originally reported by Krabacher [14], as
in Figure 25.6.
When the wheel is in the third region of the wear curve, it must be resharpened by a
procedure called dressing, which consists of (1) breaking off the dulled grits on the outside
periphery of the grinding wheel in order to expose fresh sharp grains and (2) removing
chips that have become clogged in the wheel. It is accomplished by a rotating disk, an
abrasive stick, or another grinding wheel operating at high speed, held against the wheel
being dressed as it rotates. Although dressing sharpens the wheel, it does not guarantee the
shape of the wheel. Truing is an alternative procedure that not only sharpens the wheel,
but also restores its cylindrical shape and ensures that it is straight across its outside
perimeter. The procedure uses a diamond-pointed tool (other types of truing tools are also
used) that is fed slowly and precisely across the wheel as it rotates. A very light depth is
taken (0.025 mm or less) against the wheel.

25.1.3 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS IN GRINDING
In this section, we attempt to bring together the previous discussion of wheel parameters
and theoretical analysis of grinding and consider their practical application. We also
consider grinding fluids, which are commonly used in grinding operations.
Application Guidelines There are many variables in grinding that affect the performance
and success of the operation. The guidelines listed in Table 25.5 are helpful in sorting out the
many complexities and selecting the proper wheel parameters and grinding conditions.
Grinding Fluids The proper application of cutting fluids has been found to be effective
in reducing the thermal effects and high work surface temperatures described previously.
When used in grinding operations, cutting fluids are called grinding fluids. The functions

performed by grinding fluids are similar to those performed by cutting fluids (Section
23.4). Reducing friction and removing heat from the process are the two common
functions. In addition, washing away chips and reducing temperature of the work surface
are very important in grinding.
Types of grinding fluids by chemistry include grinding oils and emulsified oils. The
grinding oils are derived from petroleum and other sources. These products are attractive
because friction is such an important factor in grinding. However, they pose hazards in
terms of fire and operator health, and their cost is high relative to emulsified oils. In
addition, their capacity to carry away heat is less than fluids based on water. Accordingly,
mixtures of oil in water are most commonly recommended as grinding fluids. These are
usually mixed with higher concentrations than emulsified oils used as conventional cutting
fluids. In this way, the friction reduction mechanism is emphasized.

25.1.4 GRINDING OPERATIONS AND GRINDING MACHINES
Grinding is traditionally used to finish parts whose geometries have already been created
by other operations. Accordingly, grinding machines have been developed to grind plain
flat surfaces, external and internal cylinders, and contour shapes such as threads. The
contour shapes are often created by special formed wheels that have the opposite of the
desired contour to be imparted to the work. Grinding is also used in tool rooms to form
the geometries on cutting tools. In addition to these traditional uses, applications of
grinding are expanding to include more high speed, high material removal operations.
Our discussion of operations and machines in this section includes the following types:

and (d) vertical spindle

(1) surface grinding, (2) cylindrical grinding, (3) centerless grinding, (4) creep feed
grinding, and (5) other grinding operations.
Surface Grinding Surface grinding is normally used to grind plain flat surfaces. It is
performed using either the periphery of the grinding wheel or the flat face of the wheel.
Because the work is normally held in a horizontal orientation, peripheral grinding is
performed by rotating the wheel about a horizontal axis, and face grinding is performed by
rotating the wheel about a vertical axis. In either case, the relative motion of the workpart is
achieved by reciprocating the work past the wheel or by rotating it. These possible
combinations of wheel orientations and workpart motions provide the four types of surface
grinding machines illustrated in Figure 25.7.
Of the four types, the horizontal spindle machine with reciprocating worktable is the
most common, shown in Figure 25.8. Grinding is accomplished by reciprocating the work
longitudinally under the wheel at a very small depth (infeed) and by feeding the wheel
transversely into the work a certain distance between strokes. In these operations, the width
of the wheel is usually less than that of the workpiece.
In addition to its conventional application, a grinding machine with horizontal
spindle and reciprocating table can be used to form special contoured surfaces by employing a formed grinding wheel. Instead of feeding the wheel transversely across the work as it
reciprocates, the wheel is plunge-fed vertically into the work. The shape of the formed
wheel is therefore imparted to the work surface.
Grinding machines with vertical spindles and reciprocating tables are set up so that
the wheel diameter is greater than the work width. Accordingly, these operations can be
performed without using a transverse feed motion. Instead, grinding is accomplished by
reciprocating the work past the wheel, and feeding the wheel vertically into the work to the
desired dimension. This configuration is capable of achieving a very flat surface on the work.

Of the two types of rotary table grinding in Figure 25.7(b) and (d), the vertical
spindle machines are more common. Owing to the relatively large surface contact area
between wheel and workpart, vertical spindle-rotary table grinding machines are capable
of high metal removal rates when equipped with appropriate grinding wheels.
Cylindrical Grinding As its name suggests, cylindrical grinding is used for rotational
parts. These grinding operations divide into two basic types (Figure 25.9): (a) external
cylindrical grinding and (b) internal cylindrical grinding.
External cylindrical grinding (also called center-type grinding to distinguish it from
centerless grinding) is performed much like a turning operation. The grinding machines
used for these operations closely resemble a lathe in which the tool post has been replaced
by a high-speed motor to rotate the grinding wheel. The cylindrical workpiece is rotated
between centers to provide a surface speed of 18 to 30 m/min (60 to 100 ft/min) [16], and the
grinding wheel, rotating at 1200 to 2000 m/min (4000 to 6500 ft/min), is engaged to perform
the cut. There are two types of feed motion possible, traverse feed and plunge-cut, shown in
Figure 25.10. In traverse feed, the grinding wheel is fed in a direction parallel to the axis of
rotation of the workpart. The infeed is set within a range typically from 0.0075 to 0.075 mm
(0.0003 to 0.003 in). A longitudinal reciprocating motion is sometimes given to either the

work or the wheel to improve surface finish. In plunge-cut, the grinding wheel is fed radially
into the work. Formed grinding wheels use this type of feed motion.
External cylindrical grinding is used to finish parts that have been machined to
approximate size and heat treated to desired hardness. The parts include axles, crankshafts, spindles, bearings and bushings, and rolls for rolling mills. The grinding operation
produces the final size and required surface finish on these hardened parts.
Internal cylindrical grinding operates somewhat like a boring operation. The workpiece is usually held in a chuck and rotated to provide surface speeds of 20 to 60 m/min (75 to
200 ft/min) [16]. Wheel surface speeds similar to external cylindrical grinding are used. The
wheel is fed in either of two ways: traverse feed, Figure 25.9(b), or plunge feed. Obviously, the
wheel diameter in internal cylindrical grinding must be smaller than the original bore hole.
This often means that the wheel diameter is quite small, necessitating very high rotational
speeds in order to achieve the desired surface speed. Internal cylindrical grinding is used to
finish the hardened inside surfaces of bearing races and bushing surfaces.
Centerless Grinding Centerless grinding is an alternative process for grinding external
and internal cylindrical surfaces. As its name suggests, the workpiece is not held between
centers. This results in a reduction in work handling time; hence, centerless grinding is often
used for high-production work. The setup for external centerless grinding (Figure 25.11),
consists of two wheels: the grinding wheel and a regulating wheel. The workparts, which
may be many individual short pieces or long rods (e.g., 3 to 4 m long), are supported by a rest
blade and fed through between the two wheels. The grinding wheel does the cutting,

rotating at surface speeds of 1200 to 1800 m/min (4000 to 6000 ft/min). The regulating wheel
rotates at much lower speeds and is inclined at a slight angle I to control throughfeed of the
work. The following equation can be used to predict throughfeed rate, based on inclination
angle and other parameters of the process [16]:
f r ¼ pDr N r sin I

ð25:11Þ

where fr ¼ throughfeed rate, mm/min (in/min); Dr ¼ diameter of the regulating wheel, mm
(in); Nr ¼ rotational speed of the regulating wheel, rev/min; and I ¼ inclination angle of the
regulating wheel.
The typical setup in internal centerless grinding is shown in Figure 25.12. In place of
the rest blade, two support rolls are used to maintain the position of the work. The
regulating wheel is tilted at a small inclination angle to control the feed of the work past
the grinding wheel. Because of the need to support the grinding wheel, throughfeed of the
work as in external centerless grinding is not possible. Therefore this grinding operation
cannot achieve the same high-production rates as in the external centerless process. Its
advantage is that it is capable of providing very close concentricity between internal and
external diameters on a tubular part such as a roller bearing race.
Creep Feed Grinding A relatively new form of grinding is creep feed grinding,
developed around 1958. Creep feed grinding is performed at very high depths of cut
and very low feed rates; hence, the name creep feed. The comparison with conventional
surface grinding is illustrated in Figure 25.13.

Chapter 25/Grinding and Other Abrasive Processes

Depths of cut in creep feed grinding are 1000 to 10,000 times greater than in
conventional surface grinding, and the feed rates are reduced by about the same proportion. However, material removal rate and productivity are increased in creep feed
grinding because the wheel is continuously cutting. This contrasts with conventional surface
grinding in which the reciprocating motion of the work results in significant lost time during
each stroke.
Creep feed grinding can be applied in both surface grinding and external cylindrical
grinding. Surface grinding applications include grinding of slots and profiles. The process
seems especially suited to those cases in which depth-to-width ratios are relatively large.
The cylindrical applications include threads, formed gear shapes, and other cylindrical
components. The term deep grinding is used in Europe to describe these external
cylindrical creep feed grinding applications.
The introduction of grinding machines designed with special features for creep feed
grinding has spurred interest in the process. The features include [11] high static and dynamic
stability, highly accurate slides, two to three times the spindle power of conventional grinding
machines, consistent table speeds for low feeds, high-pressure grinding fluid delivery systems,
and dressing systems capable of dressing the grinding wheels during the process. Typical
advantages of creep feed grinding include: (1) high material removal rates, (2) improved
accuracy for formed surfaces, and (3) reduced temperatures at the work surface.
Other Grinding Operations Several other grinding operations should be briefly mentioned to complete our review. These include tool grinding, jig grinding, disk grinding, snag
grinding, and abrasive belt grinding.
Cutting tools are made of hardened tool steel and other hard materials. Tool
grinders are special grinding machines of various designs to sharpen and recondition
cutting tools. They have devices for positioning and orienting the tools to grind the
desired surfaces at specified angles and radii. Some tool grinders are general purpose
while others cut the unique geometries of specific tool types. General-purpose tool and
cutter grinders use special attachments and adjustments to accommodate a variety of tool
geometries. Single-purpose tool grinders include gear cutter sharpeners, milling cutter
grinders of various types, broach sharpeners, and drill point grinders.
Jig grinders are grinding machines traditionally used to grind holes in hardened
steel parts to high accuracies. The original applications included pressworking dies and
tools. Although these applications are still important, jig grinders are used today in a
broader range of applications in which high accuracy and good finish are required on
hardened components. Numerical control is available on modern jig grinding machines to
achieve automated operation.
Disk grinders are grinding machines with large abrasive disks mounted on either end of
a horizontal spindle as in Figure 25.14. The work is held (usually manually) against the flat

grinder.

surface of the wheel to accomplish the grinding operation. Some disk grinding machines have
double opposing spindles. By setting the disks at the desired separation, the workpart can be
fed automatically between the two disks and ground simultaneously on opposite sides.
Advantages of the disk grinder are good flatness and parallelism at high production rates.
The snag grinder is similar in configuration to a disk grinder. The difference is that
the grinding is done on the outside periphery of the wheel rather than on the side flat
surface. The grinding wheels are therefore different in design than those in disk grinding.
Snag grinding is generally a manual operation, used for rough grinding operations such as
removing the flash from castings and forgings, and smoothing weld joints.
Abrasive belt grinding uses abrasive particles bonded to a flexible (cloth) belt. A
typical setup is illustrated in Figure 25.15. Support of the belt is required when the work is
pressed against it, and this support is provided by a roll or platen located behind the belt. A
flat platen is used for work that will have a flat surface. A soft platen can be used if it is
desirable for the abrasive belt to conform to the general contour of the part during grinding.
Belt speed depends on the material being ground; a range of 750 to 1700 m/min (2500 to
5500 ft/min) is typical [16]. Owing to improvements in abrasives and bonding materials,
abrasive belt grinding is being used increasingly for heavy stock removal rates, rather than
light grinding, which was its traditional application. The term belt sanding refers to the light
grinding applications in which the workpart is pressed against the belt to remove burrs and
high spots, and produce an improved finish quickly by hand.

25.2

RELATED ABRASIVE PROCESSES
Other abrasive processes include honing, lapping, superfinishing, polishing, and buffing. They
are used exclusively as finishing operations. The initial part shape is created by some other
process; then the part is finished by one of these operations to achieve superior surface finish.
The usual part geometries and typical surface roughness values for these processes are
indicated in Table 25.6. For comparison, we also present corresponding data for grinding.
Another class of finishing operations, called mass finishing (Section 28.1.2), is used
to finish parts in bulk rather than individually. These mass finishing methods are also used
for cleaning and deburring.

25.2.1 HONING
Honing is an abrasive process performed by a set of bonded abrasive sticks. A common
application is to finish the bores of internal combustion engines. Other applications
include bearings, hydraulic cylinders, and gun barrels. Surface finishes of around 0.12 mm

(5 m-in) or slightly better are typically achieved in these applications. In addition, honing
produces a characteristic cross-hatched surface that tends to retain lubrication during
operation of the component, thus contributing to its function and service life.
The honing process for an internal cylindrical surface is illustrated in Figure 25.16.
The honing tool consists of a set of bonded abrasive sticks. Four sticks are used on the tool
shown in the figure, but the number depends on hole size. Two to four sticks would be
used for small holes (e.g., gun barrels), and a dozen or more would be used for larger
diameter holes. The motion of the honing tool is a combination of rotation and linear
reciprocation, regulated in such a way that a given point on the abrasive stick does not
trace the same path repeatedly. This rather complex motion accounts for the crosshatched pattern on the bore surface. Honing speeds are 15 to 150 m/min (50 to 500 ft/min)
[4]. During the process, the sticks are pressed outward against the hole surface to produce
the desired abrasive cutting action. Hone pressures of 1 to 3 MPa (150 to 450 lb/in2) are
typical. The honing tool is supported in the hole by two universal joints, thus causing the
tool to follow the previously defined hole axis. Honing enlarges and finishes the hole but
cannot change its location.
Grit sizes in honing range between 30 and 600. The same trade-off between better
finish and faster material removal rates exists in honing as in grinding. The amount of
material removed from the work surface during a honing operation may be as much as

0.5 mm (0.020 in), but is usually much less than this. A cutting fluid must be used in honing
to cool and lubricate the tool and to help remove the chips.

25.2.2 LAPPING
Lapping is an abrasive process used to produce surface finishes of extreme accuracy and
smoothness. It is used in the production of optical lenses, metallic bearing surfaces, gages,
and other parts requiring very good finishes. Metal parts that are subject to fatigue loading
or surfaces that must be used to establish a seal with a mating part are often lapped.
Instead of a bonded abrasive tool, lapping uses a fluid suspension of very small
abrasive particles between the workpiece and the lapping tool. The process is illustrated
in Figure 25.17 as applied in lens-making. The fluid with abrasives is referred to as the
lapping compound and has the general appearance of a chalky paste. The fluids used to
make the compound include oils and kerosene. Common abrasives are aluminum oxide
and silicon carbide with typical grit sizes between 300 and 600. The lapping tool is called a
lap, and it has the reverse of the desired shape of the workpart. To accomplish the
process, the lap is pressed against the work and moved back and forth over the surface in
a figure-eight or other motion pattern, subjecting all portions of the surface to the same
action. Lapping is sometimes performed by hand, but lapping machines accomplish the
process with greater consistency and efficiency.
Materials used to make the lap range from steel and cast iron to copper and lead.
Wood laps have also been made. Because a lapping compound is used rather than a bonded
abrasive tool, the mechanism by which this process works is somewhat different than
grinding and honing. It is hypothesized that two alternative cutting mechanisms are at work
in lapping [4]. The first mechanism is that the abrasive particles roll and slide between the
lap and the work, with very small cuts occurring in both surfaces. The second mechanism is
that the abrasives become embedded in the lap surface and the cutting action is very similar
to grinding. It is likely that lapping is a combination of these two mechanisms, depending on
the relative hardnesses of the work and the lap. For laps made of soft materials, the
embedded grit mechanism is emphasized; and for hard laps, the rolling and sliding
mechanism dominates.

25.2.3 SUPERFINISHING
Superfinishing is an abrasive process similar to honing. Both processes use a bonded abrasive
stick moved with a reciprocating motion and pressed against the surface to be finished.
Superfinishing differs from honing in the following respects [4]: (1) the strokes are shorter,
5 mm (3/16 in); (2) higher frequencies are used, up to 1500 strokes per minute; (3) lower
pressures are applied between the tool and the surface, below 0.28 MPa (40 lb/in2);
(4) workpiece speeds are lower, 15 m/min (50 ft/min) or less; and (5) grit sizes are generally
smaller. The relative motion between the abrasive stick and the work surface is varied so

that individual grains do not retrace the same path. A cutting fluid is used to cool the work
surface and wash away chips. In addition, the fluid tends to separate the abrasive stick from
the work surface after a certain level of smoothness is achieved, thus preventing further
cutting action. The result of these operating conditions is mirror-like finishes with surface
roughness values around 0.025 mm (1 m-in). Superfinishing can be used to finish flat and
external cylindrical surfaces. The process is illustrated in Figure 25.18 for the latter
geometry.

25.2.4 POLISHING AND BUFFING
Polishing is used to remove scratches and burrs and to smooth rough surfaces by means of
abrasive grains attached to a polishing wheel rotating at high speed—around 2300 m/min
(7500 ft/min). The wheels are made of canvas, leather, felt, and even paper; thus, the wheels
are somewhat flexible. The abrasive grains are glued to the outside periphery of the wheel.
After the abrasives have been worn down and used up, the wheel is replenished with new
grits. Grit sizes of 20 to 80 are used for rough polishing, 90 to 120 for finish polishing, and
above 120 for fine finishing. Polishing operations are often accomplished manually.
Buffing is similar to polishing in appearance, but its function is different. Buffing is
used to provide attractive surfaces with high luster. Buffing wheels are made of materials
similar to those used for polishing wheels—leather, felt, cotton, etc.—but buffing wheels
are generally softer. The abrasives are very fine and are contained in a buffing compound
that is pressed into the outside surface of the wheel while it rotates. This contrasts with
polishing in which the abrasive grits are glued to the wheel surface. As in polishing, the
abrasive particles must be periodically replenished. Buffing is usually done manually,
although machines have been designed to perform the process automatically. Speeds are
generally 2400 to 5200 m/min (8000 to 17,000 ft/min).

workpiece is 200 mm long, 30 mm wide, and 75 mm
thick. To make a fair comparison, the grinding wheel
in both cases is 250 mm in diameter, 35 mm in width,
and rotates at 1500 rev/min. It is desired to remove
25 mm of material from the surface. When traditional grinding is used, the infeed is set at 0.025 mm,
and the wheel traverses twice (forward and back)
across the work surface during each pass before
resetting the infeed. There is no crossfeed since
the wheel width is greater than the work width.
Each pass is made at a workspeed of 12 m/min,
but the wheel overshoots the part on both sides. With
acceleration and deceleration, the wheel is engaged
in the work for 50% of the time on each pass. When
creep feed grinding is used, the depth is increased by
1000 and the forward feed is decreased by 1000. How
long will it take to complete the grinding operation
(a) with traditional grinding and (b) with creep feed
grinding?
In a certain grinding operation, the grade of the

Conventional machining processes (i.e., turning, drilling,
milling) use a sharp cutting tool to form a chip from the
work by shear deformation. In addition to these conventional methods, there is a group of processes that uses other
mechanisms to remove material. The term nontraditional
machining refers to this group that removes excess material by various techniques involving mechanical, thermal,
electrical, or chemical energy (or combinations of these
energies). They do not use a sharp cutting tool in the
conventional sense.
The nontraditional processes have been developed
since World War II largely in response to new and unusual
machining requirements that could not be satisfied by
conventional methods. These requirements, and the resulting commercial and technological importance of the nontraditional processes, include:
å The need to machine newly developed metals and nonmetals. These new materials often have special properties (e.g., high strength, high hardness, high toughness)
that make them difficult or impossible to machine by
conventional methods.
å The need for unusual and/or complex part geometries
that cannot easily be accomplished and in some cases
are impossible to achieve by conventional machining.
å The need to avoid surface damage that often accompanies the stresses created by conventional machining.
Many of these requirements are associated with the
aerospace and electronics industries, which have become
increasingly important in recent decades.
There are literally dozens of nontraditional machining processes, most of which are unique in their range of
applications. In the present chapter, we discuss those that

are most important commercially. More detailed discussions of these nontraditional
methods are presented in several of the references.
The nontraditional processes are often classified according to principal form of
energy used to effect material removal. By this classification, there are four types:
1. Mechanical. Mechanical energy in some form other than the action of a conventional
cutting tool is used in these nontraditional processes. Erosion of the work material by a
high velocity stream of abrasives or fluid (or both) is a typical form of mechanical
action in these processes.
2. Electrical. These nontraditional processes use electrochemical energy to remove
material; the mechanism is the reverse of electroplating.
3. Thermal. These processes use thermal energy to cut or shape the workpart. The
thermal energy is generally applied to a very small portion of the work surface, causing
that portion to be removed by fusion and/or vaporization. The thermal energy is
generated by the conversion of electrical energy.
4. Chemical. Most materials (metals particularly) are susceptible to chemical attack by
certain acids or other etchants. In chemical machining, chemicals selectively remove
material from portions of the workpart, whereas other portions of the surface are
protected by a mask.

26.1

MECHANICAL ENERGY PROCESSES
In this section we examine several of the nontraditional processes that use mechanical
energy other than a sharp cutting tool: (1) ultrasonic machining, (2) water jet processes,
and (3) other abrasive processes.

26.1.1 ULTRASONIC MACHINING
Ultrasonic machining (USM) is a nontraditional machining process in which abrasives
contained in a slurry are driven at high velocity against the work by a tool vibrating at low
amplitude and high frequency. The amplitudes are around 0.075 mm (0.003 in), and the
frequencies are approximately 20,000 Hz. The tool oscillates in a direction perpendicular to
the work surface, and is fed slowly into the work, so that the shape of the tool is formed in the
part. However, it is the action of the abrasives, impinging against the work surface, that
performs the cutting. The general arrangement of the USM process is depicted in Figure 26.1.
Common tool materials used in USM include soft steel and stainless steel. Abrasive
materials in USM include boron nitride, boron carbide, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide,

and diamond. Grit size (Section 16.1.1) ranges between 100 and 2000. The vibration
amplitude should be set approximately equal to the grit size, and the gap size should be
maintained at about two times grit size. To a significant degree, grit size determines the
surface finish on the new work surface. In addition to surface finish, material removal rate
is an important performance variable in ultrasonic machining. For a given work material,
the removal rate in USM increases with increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration.
The cutting action in USM operates on the tool as well as the work. As the abrasive
particles erode the work surface, they also erode the tool, thus affecting its shape. It is
therefore important to know the relative volumes of work material and tool material
removed during the process—similar to the grinding ratio (Section 25.1.2). This ratio of
stock removed to tool wear varies for different work materials, ranging from around 100:1
for cutting glass down to about 1:1 for cutting tool steel.
The slurry in USM consists of a mixture of water and abrasive particles. Concentration of abrasives in water ranges from 20% to 60% [5]. The slurry must be continuously circulated to bring fresh grains into action at the tool–work gap. It also washes away
chips and worn grits created by the cutting process.
The development of ultrasonic machining was motivated by the need to machine
hard, brittle work materials, such as ceramics, glass, and carbides. It is also successfully
used on certain metals, such as stainless steel and titanium. Shapes obtained by USM
include non-round holes, holes along a curved axis, and coining operations, in which an
image pattern on the tool is imparted to a flat work surface.

26.1.2 PROCESSES USING WATER JETS
The two processes described in this section remove material by means of high-velocity
streams of water or a combination of water and abrasives.
Water Jet Cutting Water jet cutting (WJC) uses a fine, high-pressure, high-velocity
stream of water directed at the work surface to cause cutting of the work, as illustrated in
Figure 26.2. To obtain the fine stream of water a small nozzle opening of diameter 0.1 to 0.4
mm (0.004 to 0.016 in) is used. To provide the stream with sufficient energy for cutting,
pressures up to 400 MPa (60,000 lb/in2) are used, and the jet reaches velocities up to 900 m/s
(3000 ft/sec). The fluid is pressurized to the desired level by a hydraulic pump. The nozzle
unit consists of a holder made of stainless steel, and a jewel nozzle made of sapphire, ruby, or

diamond. Diamond lasts the longest but costs the most. Filtration systems must be used in
WJC to separate the swarf produced during cutting.
Cutting fluids in WJC are polymer solutions, preferred because of their tendency to
produce a coherent stream. We have discussed cutting fluids before in the context of
conventional machining (Section 23.4), but never has the term been more appropriately
applied than in WJC.
Important process parameters include standoff distance, nozzle opening diameter,
water pressure, and cutting feed rate. As in Figure 26.2, the standoff distance is the separation
between the nozzle opening and the work surface. It is generally desirable for this distance to
be small to minimize dispersion of the fluid stream before it strikes the surface. A typical
standoff distance is 3.2 mm (0.125 in). Size of the nozzle orifice affects the precision of the cut;
smaller openings are used for finer cuts on thinner materials. To cut thicker stock, thicker jet
streams and higher pressures are required. The cutting feed rate refers to the velocity at which
the WJC nozzle is traversed along the cutting path. Typical feed rates range from 5 mm/s
(12 in/min) to more than 500 mm/s (1200 in/min), depending on work material and its
thickness [5]. The WJC process is usually automated using computer numerical control or
industrial robots to manipulate the nozzle unit along the desired trajectory.
Water jet cutting can be used effectively to cut narrow slits in flat stock such as plastic,
textiles, composites, floor tile, carpet, leather, and cardboard. Robotic cells have been
installed with WJC nozzles mounted as the robot’s tool to follow cutting patterns that are
irregular in three dimensions, such as cutting and trimming of automobile dashboards
before assembly [9]. In these applications, advantages of WJC include: (1) no crushing or
burning of the work surface typical in other mechanical or thermal processes, (2) minimum
material loss because of the narrow cut slit, (3) no environmental pollution, and (4) ease of
automating the process. A limitation of WJC is that the process is not suitable for cutting
brittle materials (e.g., glass) because of their tendency to crack during cutting.
Abrasive Water Jet Cutting When WJC is used on metallic workparts, abrasive particles
must usually be added to the jet stream to facilitate cutting. This process is therefore called
abrasive water jet cutting (AWJC). Introduction of abrasive particles into the stream
complicates the process by adding to the number of parameters that must be controlled.
Among the additional parameters are abrasive type, grit size, and flow rate. Aluminum
oxide, silicon dioxide, and garnet (a silicate mineral) are typical abrasive materials, at grit
sizes ranging between 60 and 120. The abrasive particles are added to the water stream at
approximately 0.25 kg/min (0.5 lb/min) after it has exited the WJC nozzle.
The remaining process parameters include those that are common to WJC: nozzle
opening diameter, water pressure, and standoff distance. Nozzle orifice diameters are
0.25 to 0.63 mm (0.010 to 0.025 in)—somewhat larger than in water jet cutting to permit
higher flow rates and more energy to be contained in the stream before injection of
abrasives. Water pressures are about the same as in WJC. Standoff distances are
somewhat less to minimize the effect of dispersion of the cutting fluid that now contains
abrasive particles. Typical standoff distances are between 1/4 and 1/2 of those in WJC.

26.1.3 OTHER NONTRADITIONAL ABRASIVE PROCESSES
Two additional mechanical energy processes use abrasives to accomplish deburring,
polishing, or other operations in which very little material is removed.
Abrasive Jet Machining Not to be confused with AWJC is the process called abrasive
jet machining (AJM), a material removal process caused by the action of a high-velocity
stream of gas containing small abrasive particles, as in Figure 26.3. The gas is dry, and
pressures of 0.2 to 1.4 MPa (25 to 200 lb/in2) are used to propel it through nozzle orifices

of diameter 0.075 to 1.0 mm (0.003 to 0.040 in) at velocities of 2.5 to 5.0 m/s (500 to 1000 ft/
min). Gases include dry air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium.
The process is usually performed manually by an operator who directs the nozzle at
the work. Typical distances between nozzle tip and work surface range between 3 mm and
75 mm (0.125 in and 3 in). The workstation must be set up to provide proper ventilation for
the operator.
AJM is normally used as a finishing process rather than a production cutting process.
Applications include deburring, trimming and deflashing, cleaning, and polishing. Cutting is
accomplished successfully on hard, brittle materials (e.g., glass, silicon, mica, and ceramics)
that are in the form of thin flat stock. Typical abrasives used in AJM include aluminum oxide
(for aluminum and brass), silicon carbide (for stainless steel and ceramics), and glass beads
(for polishing). Grit sizes are small, 15 to 40 mm (0.0006 to 0.0016 in) in diameter, and must be
uniform in size for a given application. It is important not to recycle the abrasives because
used grains become fractured (and therefore smaller in size), worn, and contaminated.
Abrasive Flow Machining This process was developed in the 1960s to deburr and polish
difficult-to-reach areas using abrasive particles mixed in a viscoelastic polymer that is
forced to flow through or around the part surfaces and edges. The polymer has the
consistency of putty. Silicon carbide is a typical abrasive. Abrasive flow machining
(AFM) is particularly well-suited for internal passageways that are often inaccessible
by conventional methods. The abrasive-polymer mixture, called the media, flows past the
target regions of the part under pressures ranging between 0.7 and 20 MPa (100 and 3000 lb/
in2). In addition to deburring and polishing, other AFM applications include forming radii
on sharp edges, removing rough surfaces on castings, and other finishing operations. These
applications are found in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and die-making. The
process can be automated to economically finish hundreds of parts per hour.
A common setup is to position the workpart between two opposing cylinders, one
containing media and the other empty. The media is forced to flow through the part from
the first cylinder to the other, and then back again, as many times as necessary to achieve
the desired material removal and finish.

26.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING PROCESSES
An important group of nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove material.
This group is identified by the term electrochemical processes, because electrical energy
is used in combination with chemical reactions to accomplish material removal. In effect,
these processes are the reverse of electroplating (Section 28.3.1). The work material must
be a conductor in the electrochemical machining processes.

Section 26.2/Electrochemical Machining Processes

633

26.2.1 ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING
The basic process in this group is electrochemical machining (ECM). Electrochemical
machining removes metal from an electrically conductive workpiece by anodic dissolution, in which the shape of the workpiece is obtained by a formed electrode tool in close
proximity to, but separated from, the work by a rapidly flowing electrolyte. ECM is
basically a deplating operation. As illustrated in Figure 26.4, the workpiece is the anode,
and the tool is the cathode. The principle underlying the process is that material is
deplated from the anode (the positive pole) and deposited onto the cathode (the negative
pole) in the presence of an electrolyte bath (Section 4.5). The difference in ECM is that
the electrolyte bath flows rapidly between the two poles to carry off the deplated
material, so that it does not become plated onto the tool.
The electrode tool, usually made of copper, brass, or stainless steel, is designed to
possess approximately the inverse of the desired final shape of the part. An allowance in the
tool size must be provided for the gap that exists between the tool and the work. To
accomplish metal removal, the electrode is fed into the work at a rate equal to the rate of
metal removal from the work. Metal removal rate is determined by Faraday’s First Law,
which states that the amount of chemical change produced by an electric current (i.e., the
amount of metal dissolved) is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed (current 
time):
V ¼ CIt

ð26:1Þ

where V ¼ volume of metal removed, mm (in ); C ¼ a constant called the specific removal
rate that depends on atomic weight, valence, and density of the work material, mm3/amp-s
(in3/amp-min); I ¼ current, amps; and t ¼ time, s (min).
Based on Ohm’s law, current I ¼ E/R, where E ¼ voltage and R ¼ resistance. Under
the conditions of the ECM operation, resistance is given by

It is convenient to convert this equation into an expression for feed rate, the rate at which
the electrode (tool) can be advanced into the work. This conversion can be accomplished

where A ¼ the frontal area of the electrode, mm2 (in2).
This is the projected area of the tool in the direction of the feed into the work. Values of
specific removal rate C are presented in Table 26.1 for various work materials. We should note
that this equation assumes 100% efficiency of metal removal. The actual efficiency is in the
range 90% to 100% and depends on tool shape, voltage and current density, and other factors.

The preceding equations indicate the important process parameters for determining
metal removal rate and feed rate in electrochemical machining: gap distance g, electrolyte
resistivity r, current I, and electrode frontal area A. Gap distance needs to be controlled closely.
If g becomes too large, the electrochemical process slows down. However, if the electrode
touches the work, a short circuit occurs, which stops the process altogether. As a practical
matter, gap distance is usually maintained within a range 0.075 to 0.75 mm (0.003 to 0.030 in).
Water is used as the base for the electrolyte in ECM. To reduce electrolyte resistivity,
salts such as NaCl or NaNO3 are added in solution. In addition to carrying off the material
that has been removed from the workpiece, the flowing electrolyte also serves the function
of removing heat and hydrogen bubbles created in the chemical reactions of the process. The
removed work material is in the form of microscopic particles that must be separated from
the electrolyte through centrifuge, sedimentation, or other means. The separated particles
form a thick sludge whose disposal is an environmental problem associated with ECM.
Large amounts of electrical power are required to perform ECM. As the equations
indicate, rate of metal removal is determined by electrical power, specifically the current
density that can be supplied to the operation. The voltage in ECM is kept relatively low to
minimize arcing across the gap.
Electrochemical machining is generally used in applications in which the work metal
is very hard or difficult to machine, or the workpart geometry is difficult (or impossible) to
accomplish by conventional machining methods. Work hardness makes no difference
in ECM, because the metal removal is not mechanical. Typical ECM applications include:
(1) die sinking, which involves the machining of irregular shapes and contours into forging
dies, plastic molds, and other shaping tools; (2) multiple hole drilling, in which many holes
can be drilled simultaneously with ECM and conventional drilling would probably require
the holes to be made sequentially; (3) holes that are not round, because ECM does not use
a rotating drill; and (4) deburring (Section 26.2.2).
Advantages of ECM include: (1) little surface damage to the workpart, (2) no burrs
as in conventional machining, (3) low tool wear (the only tool wear results from the
flowing electrolyte), and (4) relatively high metal removal rates for hard and difficult-tomachine metals. Disadvantages of ECM are: (1) significant cost of electrical power to
drive the operation and (2) problems of disposing of the electrolyte sludge.

26.2.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL DEBURRING AND GRINDING
Electrochemical deburring (ECD) is an adaptation of ECM designed to remove burrs or
to round sharp corners on metal workparts by anodic dissolution. One possible setup for
ECD is shown in Figure 26.5. The hole in the workpart has a sharp burr of the type that is

produced in a conventional through-hole drilling operation. The electrode tool is
designed to focus the metal removal action on the burr. Portions of the tool not being
used for machining are insulated. The electrolyte flows through the hole to carry away the
burr particles. The same ECM principles of operation also apply to ECD. However, since
much less material is removed in electrochemical deburring, cycle times are much
shorter. A typical cycle time in ECD is less than a minute. The time can be increased
if it is desired to round the corner in addition to removing the burr.
Electrochemical grinding (ECG) is a special form of ECM in which a rotating
grinding wheel with a conductive bond material is used to augment the anodic dissolution
of the metal workpart surface, as illustrated in Figure 26.6. Abrasives used in ECG
include aluminum oxide and diamond. The bond material is either metallic (for diamond
abrasives) or resin bond impregnated with metal particles to make it electrically
conductive (for aluminum oxide). The abrasive grits protruding from the grinding wheel
at the contact with the workpart establish the gap distance in ECG. The electrolyte flows
through the gap between the grains to play its role in electrolysis.
Deplating is responsible for 95% or more of the metal removal in ECG, and the
abrasive action of the grinding wheel removes the remaining 5% or less, mostly in the form
of salt films that have been formed during the electrochemical reactions at the work surface.
Because most of the machining is accomplished by electrochemical action, the grinding
wheel in ECG lasts much longer than a wheel in conventional grinding. The result is a much
higher grinding ratio. In addition, dressing of the grinding wheel is required much less
frequently. These are the significant advantages of the process. Applications of ECG
include sharpening of cemented carbide tools and grinding of surgical needles, other thin
wall tubes, and fragile parts.

26.3 THERMAL ENERGY PROCESSES
Material removal processes based on thermal energy are characterized by very high local
temperatures—hot enough to remove material by fusion or vaporization. Because of the
high temperatures, these processes cause physical and metallurgical damage to the new
work surface. In some cases, the resulting finish is so poor that subsequent processing is
required to smooth the surface. In this section we examine several thermal energy
processes that have commercial importance: (1) electric discharge machining and electric
discharge wire cutting, (2) electron beam machining, (3) laser beam machining, (4) arc
cutting processes, and (5) oxyfuel cutting processes.

26.3.1 ELECTRIC DISCHARGE PROCESSES
Electric discharge processes remove metal by a series of discrete electrical discharges
(sparks) that cause localized temperatures high enough to melt or vaporize the metal in
the immediate vicinity of the discharge. The two main processes in this category are (1)
electric discharge machining and (2) wire electric discharge machining. These processes
can be used only on electrically conducting work materials. The video clip on electric
discharge machining illustrates the various types of EDM.
VIDEO CLIP
Electric Discharge Machining. This clip contains three segments: (1) the EDM process,
(2) ram EDM, and (3) wire EDM.

Electric Discharge Machining Electric discharge machining (EDM) is one of the most
widely used nontraditional processes. An EDM setup is illustrated in Figure 26.7. The
shape of the finished work surface is produced by a formed electrode tool. The sparks
occur across a small gap between tool and work surface. The EDM process must take
place in the presence of a dielectric fluid, which creates a path for each discharge as the
fluid becomes ionized in the gap. The discharges are generated by a pulsating direct
current power supply connected to the work and the tool.
Figure 26.7(b) shows a close-up view of the gap between the tool and the work. The
discharge occurs at the location where the two surfaces are closest. The dielectric fluid
ionizes at this location to create a path for the discharge. The region in which discharge
occurs is heated to extremely high temperatures, so that a small portion of the work
surface is suddenly melted and removed. The flowing dielectric then flushes away the
small particle (call it a ‘‘chip’’). Because the surface of the work at the location of the
previous discharge is now separated from the tool by a greater distance, this location is
less likely to be the site of another spark until the surrounding regions have been reduced
to the same level or below. Although the individual discharges remove metal at very

localized points, they occur hundreds or thousands of times per second so that a gradual
erosion of the entire surface occurs in the area of the gap.
Two important process parameters in EDM are discharge current and frequency of
discharges. As either of these parameters is increased, metal removal rate increases.
Surface roughness is also affected by current and frequency, as shown in Figure 26.8(a).
The best surface finish is obtained in EDM by operating at high frequencies and low
discharge currents. As the electrode tool penetrates into the work, overcutting occurs.
Overcut in EDM is the distance by which the machined cavity in the workpart exceeds
the size of the tool on each side of the tool, as illustrated in Figure 26.7(a). It is produced
because the electrical discharges occur at the sides of the tool as well as its frontal area.
Overcut is a function of current and frequency, as seen in Figure 26.8(b), and can amount
to several hundredths of a millimeter.
The high spark temperatures that melt the work also melt the tool, creating a small
cavity in the surface opposite the cavity produced in the work. Tool wear is usually
measured as the ratio of work material removed to tool material removed (similar to the
grinding ratio). This wear ratio ranges between 1.0 and 100 or slightly above, depending
on the combination of work and electrode materials. Electrodes are made of graphite,
copper, brass, copper tungsten, silver tungsten, and other materials. The selection
depends on the type of power supply circuit available on the EDM machine, the type
of work material that is to be machined, and whether roughing or finishing is to be done.
Graphite is preferred for many applications because of its melting characteristics. In fact,
graphite does not melt. It vaporizes at very high temperatures, and the cavity created by
the spark is generally smaller than for most other EDM electrode materials. Consequently, a high ratio of work material removed to tool wear is usually obtained with
graphite tools.
The hardness and strength of the work material are not factors in EDM, because the
process is not a contest of hardness between tool and work. The melting point of the work
material is an important property, and metal removal rate can be related to melting point
approximately by the following empirical formula, based on an equation described in
Weller [17]:
RMR ¼

where RMR ¼ metal removal rate, mm3/s (in3/min); K ¼ constant of proportionality whose
value ¼ 664 in SI units (5.08 in U.S. customary units); I ¼ discharge current, amps; and Tm ¼

Melting points of selected metals are listed in Table 4.1.

Dielectric fluids used in EDM include hydrocarbon oils, kerosene, and distilled or
deionized water. The dielectric fluid serves as an insulator in the gap except when
ionization occurs in the presence of a spark. Its other functions are to flush debris out of
the gap and remove heat from tool and workpart.
Applications of electric discharge machining include both tool fabrication and parts
production. The tooling for many of the mechanical processes discussed in this book are
often made by EDM, including molds for plastic injection molding, extrusion dies, wire
drawing dies, forging and heading dies, and sheet metal stamping dies. As in ECM, the term
die sinking is used for operations in which a mold cavity is produced, and the EDM process
is sometimes referred to as ram EDM. For many of the applications, the materials used to
fabricate the tooling are difficult (or impossible) to machine by conventional methods.
Certain production parts also call for application of EDM. Examples include delicate parts
that are not rigid enough to withstand conventional cutting forces, hole drilling where the
axis of the hole is at an acute angle to the surface so that a conventional drill would be
unable to start the hole, and production machining of hard and exotic metals.
Electric Discharge Wire Cutting Electric discharge wire cutting (EDWC), commonly
called wire EDM, is a special form of electric discharge machining that uses a small
diameter wire as the electrode to cut a narrow kerf in the work. The cutting action in wire
EDM is achieved by thermal energy from electric discharges between the electrode wire
and the workpiece. Wire EDM is illustrated in Figure 26.9. The workpiece is fed past the
wire to achieve the desired cutting path, somewhat in the manner of a bandsaw operation.
Numerical control is used to control the workpart motions during cutting. As it cuts, the
wire is slowly and continuously advanced between a supply spool and a take-up spool to
present a fresh electrode of constant diameter to the work. This helps to maintain a
constant kerf width during cutting. As in EDM, wire EDM must be carried out in the
presence of a dielectric. This is applied by nozzles directed at the tool–work interface as in
our figure, or the workpart is submerged in a dielectric bath.
Wire diameters range from 0.076 to 0.30 mm (0.003 to 0.012 in), depending on
required kerf width. Materials used for the wire include brass, copper, tungsten, and

molybdenum. Dielectric fluids include deionized water or oil. As in EDM, an overcut exists
in wire EDM that makes the kerf larger than the wire diameter, as shown in Figure 26.10.
This overcut is in the range 0.020 to 0.050 mm (0.0008 to 0.002 in). Once cutting conditions
have been established for a given cut, the overcut remains fairly constant and predictable.
Although EDWC seems similar to a bandsaw operation, its precision far exceeds
that of a bandsaw. The kerf is much narrower, corners can be made much sharper, and
the cutting forces against the work are nil. In addition, hardness and toughness of the
work material do not affect cutting performance. The only requirement is that the work
material must be electrically conductive.
The special features of wire EDM make it ideal for making components for stamping
dies. Because the kerf is so narrow, it is often possible to fabricate punch and die in a single
cut, as suggested by Figure 26.11. Other tools and parts with intricate outline shapes, such as
lathe form tools, extrusion dies, and flat templates, are made with electric discharge wire
cutting.

FIGURE 26.12 Electron
beam machining (EBM).

26.3.2 ELECTRON BEAM MACHINING
Electron beam machining (EBM) is one of several industrial processes that use electron
beams. Besides machining, other applications of the technology include heat treating
(Section 27.5.2) and welding (Section 30.4). Electron beam machining uses a high
velocity stream of electrons focused on the workpiece surface to remove material by
melting and vaporization. A schematic of the EBM process is illustrated in Figure 26.12.
An electron beam gun generates a continuous stream of electrons that is accelerated to
approximately 75% of the speed of light and focused through an electromagnetic lens on
the work surface. The lens is capable of reducing the area of the beam to a diameter as
small as 0.025 mm (0.001 in). On impinging the surface, the kinetic energy of the electrons
is converted into thermal energy of extremely high density that melts or vaporizes the
material in a very localized area.
Electron beam machining is used for a variety of high-precision cutting applications
on any known material. Applications include drilling of extremely small diameter
holes—down to 0.05 mm (0.002 in) diameter, drilling of holes with very high depthto-diameter ratios—more than 100:1, and cutting of slots that are only about 0.001 in
(0.025 mm) wide. These cuts can be made to very close tolerances with no cutting forces
or tool wear. The process is ideal for micromachining and is generally limited to cutting
operations in thin parts—in the range 0.25 to 6.3 mm (0.010 to 0.250 in) thick. EBM must
be carried out in a vacuum chamber to eliminate collision of the electrons with gas
molecules. Other limitations include the high energy required and expensive equipment.

26.3.3 LASER BEAM MACHINING
Lasers are being used for a variety of industrial applications, including heat treatment
(Section 27.5.2), welding (Section 30.4), measurement (Section 42.6.2), as well as
scribing, cutting, and drilling (described here). The term laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. A laser is an optical transducer that converts
electrical energy into a highly coherent light beam. A laser light beam has several properties that distinguish it from other forms of light. It is monochromatic (theoretically,

the light has a single wave length) and highly collimated (the light rays in the beam are
almost perfectly parallel). These properties allow the light generated by a laser to be
focused, using conventional optical lenses, onto a very small spot with resulting high
power densities. Depending on the amount of energy contained in the light beam, and its
degree of concentration at the spot, the various laser processes identified in the
preceding can be accomplished.
Laser beam machining (LBM) uses the light energy from a laser to remove material
by vaporization and ablation. The setup for LBM is illustrated in Figure 26.13. The types of
lasers used in LBM are carbon dioxide gas lasers and solid-state lasers (of which there are
several types). In laser beam machining, the energy of the coherent light beam is concentrated not only optically but also in terms of time. The light beam is pulsed so that the
released energy results in an impulse against the work surface that produces a combination
of evaporation and melting, with the melted material evacuating the surface at high velocity.
LBM is used to perform various types of drilling, slitting, slotting, scribing, and
marking operations. Drilling small diameter holes is possible—down to 0.025 mm (0.001 in).
For larger holes, above 0.50-mm (0.020-in) diameter, the laser beam is controlled to cut the
outline of the hole. LBM is not considered a mass production process, and it is generally used
on thin stock. The range of work materials that can be machined by LBM is virtually
unlimited. Ideal properties of a material for LBM include high light energy absorption, poor
reflectivity, good thermal conductivity, low specific heat, low heat of fusion, and low heat of
vaporization. Of course, no material has this ideal combination of properties. The actual list
of work materials processed by LBM includes metals with high hardness and strength, soft
metals, ceramics, glass and glass epoxy, plastics, rubber, cloth, and wood.

26.3.4 ARC-CUTTING PROCESSES
The intense heat from an electric arc can be used to melt virtually any metal for the
purpose of welding or cutting. Most arc-cutting processes use the heat generated by an
arc between an electrode and a metallic workpart (usually a flat plate or sheet) to melt a

kerf that separates the part. The most common arc-cutting processes are (1) plasma arc
cutting and (2) air carbon arc cutting [11].
Plasma Arc Cutting A plasma is defined as a superheated, electrically ionized gas.
Plasma arc cutting (PAC) uses a plasma stream operating at temperatures in the range
10,000 C to 14,000 C (18,000 F to 25,000 F) to cut metal by melting, as shown in Figure 26.14. The cutting action operates by directing the high-velocity plasma stream at the
work, thus melting it and blowing the molten metal through the kerf. The plasma arc is
generated between an electrode inside the torch and the anode workpiece. The plasma flows
through a water-cooled nozzle that constricts and directs the stream to the desired location
on the work. The resulting plasma jet is a high-velocity, well-collimated stream with
extremely high temperatures at its center, hot enough to cut through metal in some cases
150 mm (6 in) thick.
Gases used to create the plasma in PAC include nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, or
mixtures of these gases. These are referred to as the primary gases in the process. Secondary
gases or water are often directed to surround the plasma jet to help confine the arc and clean
the kerf of molten metal as it forms.
Most applications of PAC involve cutting of flat metal sheets and plates. Operations
include hole piercing and cutting along a defined path. The desired path can be cut either by
use of a hand-held torch manipulated by a human operator, or by directing the cutting path
of the torch under numerical control (NC). For faster production and higher accuracy, NC is
preferred because of better control over the important process variables such as standoff
distance and feed rate. Plasma arc cutting can be used to cut nearly any electrically
conductive metal. Metals frequently cut by PAC include plain carbon steel, stainless steel,
and aluminum. The advantage of NC in these applications is high productivity. Feed rates
along the cutting path can be as high as 200 mm/s (450 in/min) for 6-mm (0.25-in) aluminum
plate and 85 mm/s (200 in/min) for 6-mm (0.25-in) steel plate [8]. Feed rates must be reduced
for thicker stock. For example, the maximum feed rate for cutting 100-mm (4-in) thick
aluminum stock is around 8 mm/s (20 in/min) [8]. Disadvantages of PAC are (1) the cut
surface is rough, and (2) metallurgical damage at the surface is the most severe among the
nontraditional metalworking processes.
Air Carbon Arc Cutting In this process, the arc is generated between a carbon electrode
and the metallic work, and a high-velocity air jet is used to blow away the melted portion of

the metal. This procedure can be used to form a kerf for severing the piece, or to gouge a
cavity in the part. Gouging is used to prepare the edges of plates for welding, for example to
create a U-groove in a butt joint (Section 29.2.1). Air carbon arc cutting is used on a variety of
metals, including cast iron, carbon steel, low alloy, and stainless steels, and various nonferrous
alloys. Spattering of the molten metal is a hazard and a disadvantage of the process.
Other Arc-Cutting Processes Various other electric arc processes are used for cutting
applications, although not as widely as plasma arc and air carbon arc cutting. These other
processes include: (1) gas metal arc cutting, (2) shielded metal arc cutting, (3) gas tungsten
arc cutting, and (4) carbon arc cutting. The technologies are the same as those used in arc
welding (Section 30.1), except that the heat of the electric arc is used for cutting.

26.3.5 OXYFUEL-CUTTING PROCESSES
A widely used family of thermal cutting processes, popularly known as flame cutting, use
the heat of combustion of certain fuel gases combined with the exothermic reaction of the
metal with oxygen. The cutting torch used in these processes is designed to deliver a
mixture of fuel gas and oxygen in the proper amounts, and to direct a stream of oxygen to
the cutting region. The primary mechanism of material removal in oxyfuel cutting (OFC)
is the chemical reaction of oxygen with the base metal. The purpose of the oxyfuel
combustion is to raise the temperature in the region of cutting to support the reaction.
These processes are commonly used to cut ferrous metal plates, in which the rapid
oxidation of iron occurs according to the following reactions [11]:
Fe þ O ! FeO þ heat

ð26:8aÞ

3Fe þ 2O2 ! Fe3 O4 þ heat

ð26:8bÞ

2Fe þ 1:5O2 ! Fe2 O3 þ heat

ð26:8cÞ

The second of these reactions, Eq. (26.8b), is the most significant in terms of heat generation.
The cutting mechanism for nonferrous metals is somewhat different. These metals are
generally characterized by lower melting temperatures than the ferrous metals, and they are
more oxidation resistant. In these cases, the heat of combustion of the oxyfuel mixture plays
a more important role in creating the kerf. Also, to promote the metal oxidation reaction,
chemical fluxes or metallic powders are often added to the oxygen stream.
Fuels used in OFC include acetylene (C2H2), MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene—
C3H4), propylene (C3H6), and propane (C3H8). Flame temperatures and heats of combustion
for these fuels are listed in Table 30.2. Acetylene burns at the highest flame temperature and is
the most widely used fuel for welding and cutting. However, there are certain hazards with the
storage and handling of acetylene that must be considered (Section 30.3.1).
OFC processes are performed either manually or by machine. Manually operated
torches are used for repair work, cutting of scrap metal, trimming of risers from sand
castings, and similar operations that generally require minimal accuracy. For production
work, machine flame cutting allows faster speeds and greater accuracies. This equipment
is often numerically controlled to allow profiled shapes to be cut.

26.4 CHEMICAL MACHINING
Chemical machining (CHM) is a nontraditional process in which material is removed by
means of a strong chemical etchant. Applications as an industrial process began shortly
after World War II in the aircraft industry. The use of chemicals to remove unwanted

645

material from a workpart can be accomplished in several ways, and different terms have
been developed to distinguish the applications. These terms include chemical milling,
chemical blanking, chemical engraving, and photochemical machining (PCM). They all
use the same mechanism of material removal, and it is appropriate to discuss the general
characteristics of chemical machining before defining the individual processes.

26.4.1 MECHANICS AND CHEMISTRY OF CHEMICAL MACHINING
The chemical machining process consists of several steps. Differences in applications and
the ways in which the steps are implemented account for the different forms of CHM. The
steps are:
1. Cleaning. The first step is a cleaning operation to ensure that material will be
removed uniformly from the surfaces to be etched.
2. Masking. A protective coating called a maskant is applied to certain portions of the
part surface. This maskant is made of a material that is chemically resistant to the
etchant (the term resist is used for this masking material). It is therefore applied to
those portions of the work surface that are not to be etched.
3. Etching. This is the material removal step. The part is immersed in an etchant that
chemically attacks those portions of the part surface that are not masked. The usual
method of attack is to convert the work material (e.g., a metal) into a salt that dissolves in
the etchant and is thereby removed from the surface. When the desired amount of material
has been removed, the part is withdrawn from the etchant and washed to stop the process.
4. Demasking. The maskant is removed from the part.
The two steps in chemical machining that involve significant variations in methods,
materials, and process parameters are masking and etching—steps 2 and 3.
Maskant materials include neoprene, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, and other
polymers. Masking can be accomplished by any of three methods: (1) cut and peel,
(2) photographic resist, and (3) screen resist. The cut and peel method applies the
maskant over the entire part by dipping, painting, or spraying. The resulting thickness of
the maskant is 0.025 to 0.125 mm (0.001 to 0.005 in). After the maskant has hardened, it is
cut using a scribing knife and peeled away in the areas of the work surface that are to be
etched. The maskant cutting operation is performed by hand, usually guiding the knife
with a template. The cut and peel method is generally used for large workparts, low
production quantities, and where accuracy is not a critical factor. This method cannot
hold tolerances tighter than 0.125 mm (0.005 in) except with extreme care.
As the name suggests, the photographic resist method (called the photoresist method
for short) uses photographic techniques to perform the masking step. The masking
materials contain photosensitive chemicals. They are applied to the work surface and
exposed to light through a negative image of the desired areas to be etched. These areas of
the maskant can then be removed from the surface using photographic developing
techniques. This procedure leaves the desired surfaces of the part protected by the maskant
and the remaining areas unprotected, vulnerable to chemical etching. Photoresist masking
techniques are normally applied where small parts are produced in high quantities, and close
tolerances are required. Tolerances closer than 0.0125 mm (0.0005 in) can be held [17].
The screen resist method applies the maskant by means of silk screening methods.
In these methods, the maskant is painted onto the workpart surface through a silk or
stainless steel mesh. Embedded in the mesh is a stencil that protects those areas to be
etched from being painted. The maskant is thus painted onto the work areas that are not
to be etched. The screen resist method is generally used in applications that are between

the other two masking methods in terms of accuracy, part size, and production quantities.
Tolerances of 0.075 mm (0.003 in) can be achieved with this masking method.
Selection of the etchant depends on work material to be etched, desired depth and rate
of material removal, and surface finish requirements. The etchant must also be matched with
the type of maskant that is used to ensure that the maskant material is not chemically attacked
by the etchant. Table 26.2 lists some of the work materials machined by CHM together with
the etchants that are generally used on these materials. Also included in the table are
penetration rates and etch factors. These parameters are explained next.
Material removal rates in CHM are generally indicated as penetration rates, mm/
min (in/min), because rate of chemical attack of the work material by the etchant is
directed into the surface. The penetration rate is unaffected by surface area. Penetration
rates listed in Table 26.2 are typical values for the given material and etchant.
Depths of cut in chemical machining are as much as 12.5 mm (0.5 in) for aircraft
panels made out of metal plates. However, many applications require depths that are only
several hundredths of a millimeter. Along with the penetration into the work, etching
also occurs sideways under the maskant, as illustrated in Figure 26.15. The effect is
referred to as the undercut, and it must be accounted for in the design of the mask for the
resulting cut to have the specified dimensions. For a given work material, the undercut is
directly related to the depth of cut. The constant of proportionality for the material is
called the etch factor, defined as
d
Fe ¼
ð26:9Þ
u
where Fe ¼ etch factor; d ¼ depth of cut, mm (in); and u ¼ undercut, mm (in).
The dimensions u and d are defined in Figure 26.15. Different work materials have
different etch factors in chemical machining. Some typical values are presented in Table 26.2.

The etch factor can be used to determine the dimensions of the cutaway areas in the
maskant, so that the specified dimensions of the etched areas on the part can be achieved.

26.4.2 CHM PROCESSES
In this section, we describe the principle chemical machining processes: (1) chemical
milling, (2) chemical blanking, (3) chemical engraving, and (4) photochemical machining.
Chemical Milling Chemical milling was the first CHM process to be commercialized.
During World War II, an aircraft company in the United States began to use chemical
milling to remove metal from aircraft components. They referred to their process as the
‘‘chem-mill’’ process. Today, chemical milling is still used largely in the aircraft industry,
to remove material from aircraft wing and fuselage panels for weight reduction. It is
applicable to large parts where substantial amounts of metal are removed during the
process. The cut and peel maskant method is employed. A template is generally used that
takes into account the undercut that will result during etching. The sequence of
processing steps is illustrated in Figure 26.16.
Chemical milling produces a surface finish that varies with different work materials. Table 26.3 provides a sampling of the values. Surface finish depends on depth of
penetration. As depth increases, finish becomes worse, approaching the upper side of the
ranges given in the table. Metallurgical damage from chemical milling is very small,
perhaps around 0.005 mm (0.0002 in) into the work surface.
Chemical Blanking Chemical blanking uses chemical erosion to cut very thin sheetmetal
parts—down to 0.025 mm (0.001 in) thick and/or for intricate cutting patterns. In both

instances, conventional punch-and-die methods do not work because the stamping forces
damage the sheet metal, or the tooling cost would be prohibitive, or both. Chemical blanking
produces parts that are burr free, an advantage over conventional shearing operations.
Methods used for applying the maskant in chemical blanking are either the photoresist method or the screen resist method. For small and/or intricate cutting patterns and
close tolerances, the photoresist method is used. Tolerances as close as 0.0025 mm
(0.0001 in) can be held on 0.025 mm (0.001 in) thick stock using the photoresist method of
masking. As stock thickness increases, more generous tolerances must be allowed. Screen
resist masking methods are not nearly so accurate as photoresist. The small work size in
chemical blanking excludes the cut and peel maskant method.
Using the screen resist method to illustrate, the steps in chemical blanking are shown
in Figure 26.17. Because chemical etching takes place on both sides of the part in chemical
blanking, it is important that the masking procedure provides accurate registration between
the two sides. Otherwise, the erosion into the part from opposite directions will not line up.
This is especially critical with small part sizes and intricate patterns.
Application of chemical blanking is generally limited to thin materials and/or
intricate patterns for reasons given in the preceding. Maximum stock thickness is around
0.75 mm (0.030 in). Also, hardened and brittle materials can be processed by chemical
blanking where mechanical methods would surely fracture the work. Figure 26.18
presents a sampling of parts produced by the chemical blanking process.
Chemical Engraving Chemical engraving is a chemical machining process for making
name plates and other flat panels that have lettering and/or artwork on one side. These
plates and panels would otherwise be made using a conventional engraving machine or
similar process. Chemical engraving can be used to make panels with either recessed
lettering or raised lettering, simply by reversing the portions of the panel to be etched.
Masking is done by either the photoresist or screen resist methods. The sequence in
chemical engraving is similar to the other CHM processes, except that a filling operation
follows etching. The purpose of filling is to apply paint or other coating into the recessed
areas that have been created by etching. Then, the panel is immersed in a solution that
dissolves the resist but does not attack the coating material. Thus, when the resist is
removed, the coating remains in the etched areas but not in the areas that were masked.
The effect is to highlight the pattern.
Photochemical Machining Photochemical machining (PCM) is chemical machining in
which the photoresist method of masking is used. The term can therefore be applied
correctly to chemical blanking and chemical engraving when these methods use the
photographic resist method. PCM is employed in metalworking when close tolerances

and/or intricate patterns are required on flat parts. Photochemical processes are also used
extensively in the electronics industry to produce intricate circuit designs on semiconductor wafers (Section 34.3).
Figure 26.19 shows the sequence of steps in photochemical machining as it is
applied to chemical blanking. There are various ways to photographically expose the
desired image onto the resist. The figure shows the negative in contact with the surface of
the resist during exposure. This is contact printing, but other photographic printing
methods are available that expose the negative through a lens system to enlarge or reduce

the size of the pattern printed on the resist surface. Photoresist materials in current use
are sensitive to ultraviolet light but not to light of other wavelengths. Therefore, with
proper lighting in the factory, there is no need to carry out the processing steps in a dark
room environment. Once the masking operation is accomplished, the remaining steps in
the procedure are similar to the other chemical machining methods.
In photochemical machining, the term corresponding to etch factor is anisotropy,
which is defined as the depth of cut d divided by the undercut u (see Figure 26.17). This is
the same definition as in Eq. (26.9).

26.5 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS
Typical applications of nontraditional processes include special geometric features and
work materials that cannot be readily processed by conventional techniques. In this
section, we examine these issues. We also summarize the general performance characteristics of nontraditional processes.
Workpart Geometry and Work Materials Some of the special workpart shapes for
which nontraditional processes are well suited are listed in Table 26.4 along with the
nontraditional processes that are likely to be appropriate.
As a group, the nontraditional processes can be applied to nearly all work materials,
metals and nonmetals. However, certain processes are not suited to certain work
materials. Table 26.5 relates applicability of the nontraditional processes to various
types of materials. Several of the processes can be used on metals but not nonmetals. For
example, ECM, EDM, and PAM require work materials that are electrical conductors.
This generally limits their applicability to metal parts. Chemical machining depends on
the availability of an appropriate etchant for the given work material. Because metals are
more susceptible to chemical attack by various etchants, CHM is commonly used to
process metals. With some exceptions, USM, AJM, EBM, and LBM can be used on both

Likely Process

Very small holes. Diameters less than 0.125 mm (0.005 in), in
some cases down to 0.025 mm (0.001 in), generally smaller
than the diameter range of conventional drill bits.
Holes with large depth-to-diameter ratios, e.g., d/D > 20.
Except for gun drilling, these holes cannot be machined in
conventional drilling operations.
Holes that are not round. Non-round holes cannot be drilled
with a rotating drill bit.
Narrow slots in slabs and plates of various materials. The
slots are not necessarily straight. In some cases, the slots have
extremely intricate shapes.
Micromachining. In addition to cutting small holes and
narrow slits, there are other material removal applications in
which the workpart and/or areas to be cut are very small.
Shallow pockets and surface details in flat parts. There is a
significant range in the sizes of the parts in this category, from
microscopic integrated circuit chips to large aircraft panels.
Special contoured shapes for mold and die applications.
These applications are sometimes referred to as die-sinking.

Performance of Nontraditional Processes The nontraditional processes are generally
characterized by low material removal rates and high specific energies relative to conventional machining operations. The capabilities for dimensional control and surface finish of
the nontraditional processes vary widely, with some of the processes providing high
accuracies and good finishes, and others yielding poor accuracies and finishes. Surface
damage is also a consideration. Some of these processes produce very little metallurgical
damage at and immediately below the work surface, whereas others (mostly the thermalbased processes) do considerable damage to the surface. Table 26.6 compares these features

for comparison. Inspection of the data reveals wide differences in machining characteristics. In comparing the characteristics of nontraditional and conventional machining, it
must be remembered that nontraditional processes are generally used where conventional
methods are not practical or economical.

Electrochemical Machining

operation is 2000 mm2. The applied current ¼ 1800
amps and the voltage ¼ 12 volts. The material being
cut is nickel (valence ¼ 2), whose specific removal
rate is given in Table 26.1. (a) If the process is 90%
efficient, determine the rate of metal removal in
mm3/min. (b) If the resistivity of the electrolyte ¼
140 ohm-mm, determine the working gap.
26.8. In an electrochemical machining operation, the frontal working area of the electrode is 2.5 in2. The applied
current ¼ 1500 amps, and the voltage ¼ 12 volts. The
material being cut is pure aluminum, whose specific
removal rate is given in Table 26.1. (a) If the ECM

26.9. A square hole is to be cut using ECM through a plate
of pure copper (valence ¼ 1) that is 20 mm thick. The
hole is 25 mm on each side, but the electrode used to

cut the hole is slightly less that 25 mm on its sides to
allow for overcut, and its shape includes a hole in its
center to permit the flow of electrolyte and reduce
the area of the cut. This tool design results in a
frontal area of 200 mm2. The applied current ¼ 1000
amps. Using an efficiency of 95%, determine how
long it will take to cut the hole.
26.10. A 3.5 in diameter through hole is to be cut in a

the cutting process, the electrode tool will have a
center hole of 3.0 in which will produce a center
core that can be removed after the tool breaks
through. The outside diameter of the electrode is
undersized to allow for overcut. The overcut is
expected to be 0.005 in on a side. If the efficiency
of the ECM operation is 90%, what current will
be required to complete the cutting operation in

26.13. Suppose the hole inProblem 26.10 were to be cut using
EDM rather than ECM. Using a discharge current ¼

melting temperature of 0.80% carbon steel from
the phase diagram in Figure 6.4.
26.16. A wire EDM operation is to be performed on a slab
of 3/4-in-thick aluminum using a brass wire electrode whose diameter ¼ 0.005 in. It is anticipated
that the overcut will be 0.001 in, so that the kerf
width will be 0.007 in. Using a discharge current ¼
7 amps, what is the expected allowable feed rate
that can be used in the operation? The melting
temperature of aluminum is 1220 F.
26.17. A wire EDM operation is used to cut out punchand-die components from 25-mm-thick tool steel
plates. However, in preliminary cuts, the surface
finish on the cut edge is poor. What changes in
discharge current and frequency of discharges
should be made to improve the finish?

Chemical Machining
26.18. Chemical milling is used in an aircraft plant to create
pockets in wing sections made of an aluminum alloy.
The starting thickness of one workpart of interest is
20 mm. A series of rectangular-shaped pockets
12 mm deep are to be etched with dimensions 200
mm by 400 mm. The corners of each rectangle are
radiused to 15 mm. The part is an aluminum alloy
and the etchant is NaOH. The penetration rate for
this combination is 0.024 mm/min and the etch factor
is 1.75. Determine (a) metal removal rate in mm3/
min, (b) time required to etch to the specified depth,
and (c) required dimensions of the opening in the
cut and peel maskant to achieve the desired pocket
size on the part.
26.19. In a chemical milling operation on a flat mild steel
plate, it is desired to cut an ellipse-shaped pocket to
a depth of 0.4 in. The semiaxes of the ellipse are a ¼
9.0 in and b ¼ 6.0 in. A solution of hydrochloric and
nitric acids will be used as the etchant. Determine
(a) metal removal rate in in3/hr, (b) time required
to etch to depth, and (c) required dimensions of the

opening in the cut and peel maskant required to
achieve the desired pocket size on the part.
26.20. In a certain chemical blanking operation, a sulfuric acid
etchant is used to remove material from a sheet of
magnesium alloy. The sheet is 0.25 mm thick. The
screen resist method of masking was used to permit
highproductionratestobeachieved.Asitturnsout,the
process is producing a large proportion of scrap. Specified tolerances of 0.025 mm are not being achieved.
The foreman in the CHM department complains that
there must be something wrong with the sulfuric acid.
‘‘Perhaps the concentration is incorrect,’’ he suggests.
Analyze the problem and recommend a solution.
26.21. In a chemical blanking operation, stock thickness of
the aluminum sheet is 0.015 in. The pattern to be cut
out of the sheet is a hole pattern, consisting of a
matrix of 0.100-in diameter holes. If photochemical
machining is used to cut these holes, and contact
printing is used to make the resist (maskant) pattern,

The manufacturing processes covered in the preceding chapters involve the creation of part geometry. We now consider
processes that either enhance the properties of the workpart
(Chapter 27) or apply some surface treatment to it, such as
cleaning or coating (Chapter 28). Property-enhancing operations are performed to improve mechanical or physical
properties of the work material. They do not alter part
geometry, at least not intentionally. The most important
property-enhancing operations are heat treatments. Heat
treatment involves various heating and cooling procedures
performed to effect microstructural changes in a material,
which in turn affect its mechanical properties. Its most
common applications are on metals, discussed in this chapter. Similar treatments are performed on glass-ceramics
(Section 7.4.3), tempered glass (Section 12.3.1), and powder
metals and ceramics (Sections 16.3.3 and 17.2.3).
Heat treatment operations can be performed on a
metallic workpart at various times during its manufacturing
sequence. In some cases, the treatment is applied before
shaping (e.g., to soften the metal so that it can be more
easily formed while hot). In other cases, heat treatment is
used to relieve the effects of strain hardening that occur

during forming, so that the material can be subjected to further deformation. Heat
treatment can also be accomplished at or near the end of the sequence to achieve the final
strength and hardness required in the finished product. The principal heat treatments are
annealing, martensite formation in steel, precipitation hardening, and surface hardening.

27.1

ANNEALING
Annealing consists of heating the metal to a suitable temperature, holding at that
temperature for a certain time (called soaking), and slowly cooling. It is performed
on a metal for any of the following reasons: (1) to reduce hardness and brittleness, (2) to
alter microstructure so that desirable mechanical properties can be obtained, (3) to
soften metals for improved machinability or formability, (4) to recrystallize cold-worked
(strain-hardened) metals, and (5) to relieve residual stresses induced by prior processes.
Different terms are used in annealing, depending on the details of the process and the
temperature used relative to the recrystallization temperature of the metal being treated.
Full annealing is associated with ferrous metals (usually low and medium carbon
steels); it involves heating the alloy into the austenite region, followed by slow cooling in
the furnace to produce coarse pearlite. Normalizing involves similar heating and soaking
cycles, but the cooling rates are faster. The steel is allowed to cool in air to room
temperature. This results in fine pearlite, higher strength and hardness, but lower ductility
than the full anneal treatment.
Cold-worked parts are often annealed to reduce effects of strain hardening and
increase ductility. The treatment allows the strain-hardened metal to recrystallize
partially or completely, depending on temperatures, soaking periods, and cooling rates.
When annealing is performed to allow for further cold working of the part, it is called a
process anneal. When performed on the completed (cold-worked) part to remove the
effects of strain hardening and where no subsequent deformation will be accomplished, it
is simply called an anneal. The process itself is pretty much the same, but different terms
are used to indicate the purpose of the treatment.
If annealing conditions permit full recovery of the cold-worked metal to its original
grain structure, then recrystallization has occurred. After this type of anneal, the metal
has the new geometry created by the forming operation, but its grain structure and
associated properties are essentially the same as before cold working. The conditions that
tend to favor recrystallization are higher temperature, longer holding time, and slower
cooling rate. If the annealing process only permits partial return of the grain structure
toward its original state, it is termed a recovery anneal. Recovery allows the metal to
retain most of the strain hardening obtained in cold working, but the toughness of the
part is improved.
The preceding annealing operations are performed primarily to accomplish functions
other than stress relief. However, annealing is sometimes performed solely to relieve
residual stresses in the workpiece. Called stress-relief annealing, it helps to reduce
distortion and dimensional variations that might otherwise occur in the stressed parts.

27.2

MARTENSITE FORMATION IN STEEL
The iron–carbon phase diagram in Figure 6.4 indicates the phases of iron and iron carbide
(cementite) present under equilibrium conditions. It assumes that cooling from high
temperature is slow enough to permit austenite to decompose into a mixture of ferrite
and cementite (Fe3C) at room temperature. This decomposition reaction requires

diffusion and other processes that depend on time and temperature to transform the
metal into its preferred final form. However, under conditions of rapid cooling, so that
the equilibrium reaction is inhibited, austenite transforms into a nonequilibrium phase
called martensite. Martensite is a hard, brittle phase that gives steel its unique ability to
be strengthened to very high levels. Our video clip on heat treatment gives an overview of
the heat treatment of steel.

27.2.1 THE TIME-TEMPERATURE-TRANSFORMATION CURVE
The nature of the martensite transformation can best be understood using the timetemperature-transformation curve (TTT curve) for eutectoid steel, illustrated in Figure 27.1.
The TTT curve shows how cooling rate affects the transformation of austenite into various
possible phases. The phases can be divided between (1) alternative forms of ferrite and
cementite and (2) martensite. Time is displayed (logarithmically for convenience) along
the horizontal axis, and temperature is scaled on the vertical axis. The curve is interpreted
by starting at time zero in the austenite region (somewhere above the A1 temperature line
for the given composition) and proceeding downward and to the right along a trajectory
representing how the metal is cooled as a function of time. The TTT curve shown in the
figure is for a specific composition of steel (0.80% carbon). The shape of the curve is
different for other compositions.
At slow cooling rates, the trajectory proceeds through the region indicating
transformation into pearlite or bainite, which are alternative forms of ferrite–carbide
mixtures. Because these transformations take time, the TTT diagram shows two lines—
the start and finish of the transformation as time passes, indicated for the different phase
regions by the subscripts s and f, respectively. Pearlite is a mixture of ferrite and carbide

phases in the form of thin parallel plates. It is obtained by slow cooling from austenite, so
that the cooling trajectory passes through Ps above the ‘‘nose’’ of the TTT curve. Bainite
is an alternative mixture of the same phases that can be produced by initial rapid cooling
to a temperature somewhat above Ms, so that the nose of the TTT curve is avoided; this is
followed by much slower cooling to pass through Bs and into the ferrite–carbide region.
Bainite has a needle-like or feather-like structure consisting of fine carbide regions.
If cooling occurs at a sufficiently rapid rate (indicated by the dashed line in Figure 27.1),
austenite is transformed into martensite. Martensite is a unique phase consisting of an
iron–carbon solution whose composition is the same as the austenite from which it was
derived. The face-centered cubic structure of austenite is transformed into the body-centered
tetragonal (BCT) structure of martensite almost instantly—without the time-dependent
diffusion process needed to separate ferrite and iron carbide in the preceding transformations.
During cooling, the martensite transformation begins at a certain temperature Ms,
and finishes at a lower temperature Mf, as shown in our TTT diagram. At points between
these two levels, the steel is a mixture of austenite and martensite. If cooling is stopped at
a temperature between the Ms and Mf lines, the austenite will transform to bainite as the
time-temperature trajectory crosses the Bs threshold. The level of the Ms line is
influenced by alloying elements, including carbon. In some cases, the Ms line is depressed
below room temperature, making it impossible for these steels to form martensite by
traditional heat-treating methods.
The extreme hardness of martensite results from the lattice strain created by
carbon atoms trapped in the BCT structure, thus providing a barrier to slip. Figure 27.2
shows the significant effect that the martensite transformation has on the hardness of
steel for increasing carbon contents.

27.2.2 THE HEAT TREATMENT PROCESS
The heat treatment to form martensite consists of two steps: austenitizing and quenching.
These steps are often followed by tempering to produce tempered martensite. Austenitizing involves heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature that it is converted

Time

entirely or partially to austenite. This temperature can be determined from the phase
diagram for the particular alloy composition. The transformation to austenite involves a
phase change, which requires time as well as heat. Accordingly, the steel must be held at
the elevated temperature for a sufficient period of time to allow the new phase to form
and the required homogeneity of composition to be achieved.
The quenching step involves cooling the austenite rapidly enough to avoid passing
through the nose of the TTT curve, as indicated in the cooling trajectory shown in
Figure 27.1. The cooling rate depends on the quenching medium and the rate of heat
transfer within the steel workpiece. Various quenching media are used in commercial heat
treatment practice: (1) brine—salt water, usually agitated; (2) fresh water—still, not
agitated; (3) still oil; and (4) air. Quenching in agitated brine provides the fastest cooling of
the heated part surface, whereas air quench is the slowest. Trouble is, the more effective
the quenching media is at cooling, the more likely it is to cause internal stresses, distortion,
and cracks in the product.
The rate of heat transfer within the part depends largely on its mass and geometry. A
large cubic shape will cool much more slowly than a small, thin sheet. The coefficient of
thermal conductivity k of the particular composition is also a factor in the flow of heat in the
metal. There is considerable variation in k for different grades of steel; for example, plain
low carbon steel has a typical k value equal to 0.046 J/sec-mm-C (2.2 Btu/hr-in-F), whereas a
highly alloyed steel might have one-third that value.
Martensiteis hard and brittle. Tempering is a heat treatment appliedtohardenedsteels
to reduce brittleness, increase ductility and toughness, and relieve stresses in the martensite
structure. It involves heating and soaking at a temperature below the austenitizing level for
about 1 hour, followed by slow cooling. This results in precipitation of very fine carbide
particles from the martensitic iron–carbon solution, and gradually transforms the crystal
structure from BCT to BCC. This new structure is called tempered martensite. A slight
reduction in strength and hardness accompanies the improvement in ductility and toughness. The temperature and time of the tempering treatment control the degree of softening in
the hardened steel, because the change from untempered to tempered martensite involves
diffusion.
Taken together, the three steps in the heat treatment of steel to form tempered
martensite can be pictured as in Figure 27.3. There are two heating and cooling cycles, the
first to produce martensite and the second to temper the martensite.

27.2.3 HARDENABILITY
Hardenability refers to the relative capacity of a steel to be hardened by transformation
to martensite. It is a property that determines the depth below the quenched surface to

which the steel is hardened, or the severity of the quench required to achieve a certain
hardness penetration. Steels with good hardenability can be hardened more deeply
below the surface and do not require high cooling rates. Hardenability does not refer to
the maximum hardness that can be attained in the steel; that depends on the carbon
content.
The hardenability of a steel is increased through alloying. Alloying elements having
the greatest effect are chromium, manganese, molybdenum (and nickel, to a lesser
extent). The mechanism by which these alloying ingredients operate is to extend the time
before the start of the austenite-to-pearlite transformation in the TTT diagram. In effect,
the TTT curve is moved to the right, thus permitting slower quenching rates during
quenching. Therefore, the cooling trajectory is able to follow a less hastened path to the
Ms line, more easily avoiding the nose of the TTT curve.
The most common method for measuring hardenability is the Jominy end-quench
test. The test involves heating a standard specimen of diameter ¼ 25.4 mm (1.0 in) and
length ¼ 102 mm (4.0 in) into the austenite range, and then quenching one end with a
stream of cold water while the specimen is supported vertically as shown in Figure 27.4
(a). The cooling rate in the test specimen decreases with increased distance from the
quenched end. Hardenability is indicated by the hardness of the specimen as a function of
distance from quenched end, as in Figure 27.4(b).

27.3

PRECIPITATION HARDENING
Precipitation hardening involves the formation of fine particles (precipitates) that act to
block the movement of dislocations and thus strengthen and harden the metal. It is the
principal heat treatment for strengthening alloys of aluminum, copper, magnesium,
nickel, and other nonferrous metals. Precipitation hardening can also be used to
strengthen certain steel alloys. When applied to steels, the process is called maraging
(an abbreviation of martensite and aging), and the steels are called maraging steels
(Section 6.2.3).
The necessary condition that determines whether an alloy system can be strengthened by precipitation hardening is the presence of a sloping solvus line, as shown in the
phase diagram of Figure 27.5(a). A composition that can be precipitation hardened is one

that contains two phases at room temperature, but which can be heated to a temperature
that dissolves the second phase. Composition C satisfies this requirement. The heat
treatment process consists of three steps, illustrated in Figure 27.5(b): (1) solution
treatment, in which the alloy is heated to a temperature Ts above the solvus line into
the alpha phase region and held for a period sufficient to dissolve the beta phase;
(2) quenching to room temperature to create a supersaturated solid solution; and
(3) precipitation treatment, in which the alloy is heated to a temperature Tp, below
Ts, to cause precipitation of fine particles of the beta phase. This third step is called aging,
and for this reason the whole heat treatment is sometimes called age hardening. However,
aging can occur in some alloys at room temperature, and so the term precipitation
hardening seems more precise for the three-step heat treatment process under discussion
here. When the aging step is performed at room temperature, it is called natural aging.
When it is accomplished at an elevated temperature, as in our figure, the term artificial
aging is often used.
It is during the aging step that high strength and hardness are achieved in the alloy.
The combination of temperature and time during the precipitation treatment (aging) is
critical in bringing out the desired properties in the alloy. At higher precipitation
treatment temperatures, as in Figure 27.6(a), the hardness peaks in a relatively short
time; whereas at lower temperatures, as in Figure 27.6(b), more time is required to
harden the alloy but its maximum hardness is likely to be greater than in the first case. As
seen in the plot, continuation of the aging process results in a reduction in hardness and
strength properties, called overaging. Its overall effect is similar to annealing.

Section 27.4/Surface Hardening

27.4

663

SURFACE HARDENING
Surface hardening refers to any of several thermochemical treatments applied to steels in
which the composition of the part surface is altered by addition of carbon, nitrogen, or
other elements. The most common treatments are carburizing, nitriding, and carbonitriding. These processes are commonly applied to low carbon steel parts to achieve a
hard, wear-resistant outer shell while retaining a tough inner core. The term case
hardening is often used for these treatments.
Carburizing is the most common surface-hardening treatment. It involves heating a
part of low carbon steel in the presence of a carbon-rich environment so that C is diffused
into the surface. In effect the surface is converted to high carbon steel, capable of higher
hardness than the low-C core. The carbon-rich environment can be created in several
ways. One method involves the use of carbonaceous materials such as charcoal or coke
packed in a closed container with the parts. This process, called pack carburizing,
produces a relatively thick layer on the part surface, ranging from around 0.6 to 4 mm
(0.025 to 0.150 in). Another method, called gas carburizing, uses hydrocarbon fuels such
as propane (C3H8) inside a sealed furnace to diffuse carbon into the parts. The case
thickness in this treatment is thin, 0.13 to 0.75 mm (0.005 to 0.030 in). Another process is
liquid carburizing, which employs a molten salt bath containing sodium cyanide
(NaCN), barium chloride (BaCl2), and other compounds to diffuse carbon into the
steel. This process produces surface layer thicknesses generally between those of the
other two treatments. Typical carburizing temperatures are 875 to 925 C (1600 to
1700 F), well into the austenite range.
Carburizing followed by quenching produces a case hardness of around HRC=60.
However, because the internal regions of the part consist of low carbon steel, and its
hardenability is low, it is unaffected by the quench and remains relatively tough and
ductile to withstand impact and fatigue stresses.
Nitriding is a treatment in which nitrogen is diffused into the surfaces of special
alloy steels to produce a thin hard casing without quenching. To be most effective, the
steel must contain certain alloying ingredients such as aluminum (0.85% to 1.5%) or
chromium (5% or more). These elements form nitride compounds that precipitate as very
fine particles in the casing to harden the steel. Nitriding methods include: gas nitriding, in
which the steel parts are heated in an atmosphere of ammonia (NH3) or other nitrogenrich gas mixture; and liquid nitriding, in which the parts are dipped in molten cyanide salt
baths. Both processes are carried out at around 500 C (950 F). Case thicknesses range
as low as 0.025 mm (0.001 in) and up to around 0.5 mm (0.020 in), with hardnesses up to
HRC 70.
As its name suggests, carbonitriding is a treatment in which both carbon and
nitrogen are absorbed into the steel surface, usually by heating in a furnace containing
carbon and ammonia. Case thicknesses are usually 0.07 to 0.5 mm (0.003 to 0.020 in), with
hardnesses comparable with those of the other two treatments.
Two additional surface-hardening treatments diffuse chromium and boron, respectively, into the steel to produce casings that are typically only 0.025 to 0.05 mm (0.001 to
0.002 in) thick. Chromizing requires higher temperatures and longer treatment times
than the preceding surface-hardening treatments, but the resulting casing is not only hard
and wear resistant, it is also heat and corrosion resistant. The process is usually applied to
low carbon steels. Techniques for diffusing chromium into the surface include: packing
the steel parts in chromium-rich powders or granules, dipping in a molten salt bath
containing Cr and Cr salts, and chemical vapor deposition (Section 28.5.2).
Boronizing is performed on tool steels, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys, and cast
irons, in addition to plain carbon steels, using powders, salts, or gas atmospheres
containing boron. The process results in a thin casing with high abrasion resistance

E1C27

Chapter 27/Heat Treatment of Metals

and low coefficient of friction. Casing hardnesses reach 70 HRC. When boronizing is used
on low carbon and low alloy steels, corrosion resistance is also improved.

27.5 HEAT TREATMENT METHODS AND FACILITIES
Most heat treatment operations are performed in furnaces. In addition, other techniques
can be used to selectively heat only the work surface or a portion of the work surface.
Thus, we divide this section into two categories of methods and facilities for heat
treatment [11]: (1) furnaces and (2) selective surface-hardening methods.
It should be mentioned that some of the equipment described here is used for other
processes in addition to heat treatment; these include melting metals for casting (Section
11.4.1); heating before warm and hot working (Section 18.3); brazing, soldering, and
adhesive curing (Chapter 31); and semiconductor processing (Chapter 34).

27.5.1 FURNACES FOR HEAT TREATMENT
Furnaces vary greatly in heating technology, size and capacity, construction, and atmosphere control. They usually heat the workparts by a combination of radiation, convection,
and conduction. Heating technologies divide between fuel-fired and electric heating. Fuelfired furnaces are normally direct-fired, which means that the work is exposed directly to
the combustion products. Fuels include gases (such as natural gas or propane) and oils that
can be atomized (such as diesel fuel and fuel oil). The chemistry of the combustion products
can be controlled by adjusting the fuel-air or fuel-oxygen mixture to minimize scaling
(oxide formation) on the work surface. Electric furnaces use electric resistance for heating;
they are cleaner, quieter, and provide more uniform heating, but they are more expensive to
purchase and operate.
A conventional furnace is an enclosure designed to resist heat loss and accommodate
the size of the work to be processed. Furnaces are classified as batch or continuous. Batch
furnaces are simpler, basically consisting of a heating system in an insulated chamber, with a
door for loading and unloading the work. Continuous furnaces are generally used for
higher production rates and provide a means of moving the work through the interior of the
heating chamber.
Special atmospheres are required in certain heat treatment operations, such as some
of the surface hardening treatments we have discussed. These atmospheres include carbonand nitrogen-rich environments for diffusion of these elements into the surface of the work.
Atmosphere control is desirable in conventional heat treatment operations to avoid
excessive oxidation or decarburization.
Other furnace types include salt bath and fluidized bed. Salt bath furnaces consist of
vessels containing molten salts of chlorides and/or nitrates. Parts to be treated are immersed
in the molten media. Fluidized bed furnaces have a container in which small inert particles
are suspended by a high-velocity stream of hot gas. Under proper conditions, the aggregate
behavior of the particles is fluid-like; thus, rapid heating of parts immersed in the particle
bed occurs.

27.5.2 SELECTIVE SURFACE-HARDENING METHODS
These methods heat only the surface of the work, or local areas of the work surface. They
differ from surface-hardening methods (Section 27.4) in that no chemical changes occur.
Here the treatments are only thermal. The selective surface hardening methods include

flame hardening, induction hardening, high-frequency resistance heating, electron beam
heating, and laser beam heating.
Flame hardening involves heating the work surface by means of one or more
torches followed by rapid quenching. As a hardening process, it is applied to carbon and
alloy steels, tool steels, and cast irons. Fuels include acetylene (C2H2), propane (C3H8),
and other gases. The name flame hardening invokes images of a highly manual operation
with general lack of control over the results; however, the process can be set up to include
temperature control, fixtures for positioning the work relative to the flame, and indexing
devices that operate on a precise cycle time, all of which provide close control over the
resulting heat treatment. It is fast and versatile, lending itself to high production as well as
big components such as large gears that exceed the capacity of furnaces.
Induction heating involves application of electromagnetically induced energy
supplied by an induction coil to an electrically conductive workpart. Induction heating
is widely used in industry for processes such as brazing, soldering, adhesive curing, and
various heat treatments. When used for hardening steel, quenching follows heating. A
typical setup is illustrated in Figure 27.7. The induction heating coil carries a highfrequency alternating current that induces a current in the encircled workpart to effect
heating. The surface, a portion of the surface, or the entire mass of the part can be heated
by the process. Induction heating provides a fast and efficient method of heating any
electrically conductive material. Heating cycle times are short, so the process lends itself
to high production as well as midrange production.
High-frequency (HF) resistance heating is used to harden specific areas of steel work
surfaces by application of localized resistance heating at high frequency (400 kHz typical).
A typical setup is shown in Figure 27.8. The apparatus consists of a water-cooled proximity

conductor located over the area to be heated. Contacts are attached to the workpart at the
outer edges of the area. When the HF current is applied, the region beneath the proximity
conductor is heated rapidly to high temperature—heating to the austenite range typically
requires less than a second. When the power is turned off, the area, usually a narrow line as
in our figure, is quenched by heat transfer to the surrounding metal. Depth of the treated
area is around 0.63 mm (0.025 in); hardness depends on carbon content of the steel and can
range up to 60 HRC [11].
Electron beam (EB) heating involves localized surface hardening of steel in which
the electron beam is focused onto a small area, resulting in rapid heat buildup. Austenitizing temperatures can often be achieved in less than a second. When the directed beam is
removed, the heated area is immediately quenched and hardened by heat transfer to the
surrounding cold metal. A disadvantage of EB heating is that best results are achieved
when the process is performed in a vacuum. A special vacuum chamber is needed, and
time is required to draw the vacuum, thus slowing production rates.
Laser beam (LB) heating uses a high-intensity beam of coherent light focused on a
small area. The beam is usually moved along a defined path on the work surface, causing
heating of the steel into the austenite region. When the beam is moved, the area is
immediately quenched by heat conduction to the surrounding metal. Laser is an acronym
for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The advantage of LB over EB
heating is that laser beams do not require a vacuum to achieve best results. Energy
density levels in EB and LB heating are lower than in cutting or welding.

The processes discussed in this chapter operate on the
surfaces of parts and/or products. The major categories of
surface processing operations are (1) cleaning, (2) surface
treatments, and (3) coating and thin film deposition. Cleaning refers to industrial cleaning processes that remove soils
and contaminants that result from previous processing or
the factory environment. They include both chemical and
mechanical cleaning methods. Surface treatments are mechanical and physical operations that alter the part surface
in some way, such as improving its finish or impregnating it
with atoms of a foreign material to change its chemistry and
physical properties.
Coating and thin film deposition include various processes that apply a layer of material to a surface. Products
made of metal are almost always coated by electroplating (e.g.,
chrome plating), painting, or other process. Principal reasons
for coating a metal are to (1) provide corrosion protection,
(2) enhance product appearance (e.g., providing a specified
color or texture), (3) increase wear resistance and/or reduce
friction of the surface, (4) increase electrical conductivity,
(5) increase electrical resistance, (6) prepare a metallic
surface for subsequent processing, and (7) rebuild surfaces
worn or eroded during service. Nonmetallic materials are
also sometimes coated. Examples include (1) plastic parts
coated to give them a metallic appearance; (2) antireflection
coatings on optical glass lenses; and (3) certain coating and
deposition processes used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips (Chapter 34) and printed circuit boards
(Chapter 35). In all cases, good adhesion must be achieved
between coating and substrate, and for this to occur the
substrate surface must be very clean.

processes are used to accomplish this cleaning. Chemical cleaning methods use chemicals to
remove unwanted oils and soils from the workpiece surface. Mechanical cleaning involves
removal of substances from a surface by mechanical operations of various kinds. These
operations often serve other functions such as removing burrs, improving smoothness,
adding luster, and enhancing surface properties.

28.1.1 CHEMICAL CLEANING
A typical surface is covered with various films, oils, dirt, and other contaminants (Section
5.3.1). Although some of these substances may operate in a beneficial way (such as the
oxide film on aluminum), it is usually desirable to remove contaminants from the surface.
In this section, we discuss some general considerations related to cleaning, and we survey
the principal chemical cleaning processes used in industry.
Some of the important reasons why manufactured parts (and products) must be
cleaned are (1) to prepare the surface for subsequent industrial processing, such as a
coating application or adhesive bonding; (2) to improve hygiene conditions for workers
and customers; (3) to remove contaminants that might chemically react with the surface;
and (4) to enhance appearance and performance of the product.

General Considerations in Cleaning There is no single cleaning method that can be
used for all cleaning tasks. Just as various soaps and detergents are required for different
household jobs (laundry, dishwashing, pot scrubbing, bathtub cleaning, and so forth),
various cleaning methods are also needed to solve different cleaning problems in
industry. Important factors in selecting a cleaning method are (1) the contaminant to
be removed, (2) degree of cleanliness required, (3) substrate material to be cleaned,
(4) purpose of the cleaning, (5) environmental and safety factors, (6) size and geometry of
the part, and (7) production and cost requirements.
Various kinds of contaminants build up on part surfaces, either due to previous
processing or the factory environment. To select the best cleaning method, one must
first identify what must be cleaned. Surface contaminants found in the factory usually
divide into one of the following categories: (1) oil and grease, which includes lubricants
used in metalworking; (2) solid particles such as metal chips, abrasive grits, shop dirt,
dust, and similar materials; (3) buffing and polishing compounds; and (4) oxide films, rust,
and scale.
Degree of cleanliness refers to the amount of contaminant remaining after a given
cleaning operation. Parts being prepared to accept a coating (e.g., paint, metallic film) or
adhesive must be very clean; otherwise, adhesion of the coated material is jeopardized. In
other cases, it may be desirable for the cleaning operation to leave a residue on the part
surface for corrosion protection during storage, in effect replacing one contaminant on
the surface by another that is beneficial. Degree of cleanliness is often difficult to
measure in a quantifiable way. A simple test is a wiping method, in which the surface is
wiped with a clean white cloth, and the amount of soil absorbed by the cloth is observed.
It is a nonquantitative but easy test to use.
The substrate material must be considered in selecting a cleaning method, so that
damaging reactions are not caused by the cleaning chemicals. To cite several examples:
aluminum is dissolved by most acids and alkalis; magnesium is attacked by many acids;
copper is attacked by oxidizing acids (e.g., nitric acid); steels are resistant to alkalis but
react with virtually all acids.
Some cleaning methods are appropriate to prepare the surface for painting, while
others are better for plating. Environmental protection and worker safety are becoming
increasingly important in industrial processes. Cleaning methods and the associated
chemicals should be selected to avoid pollution and health hazards.

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

Chemical Cleaning Processes Chemical cleaning uses various types of chemicals to
effect contaminant removal from the surface. The major chemical cleaning methods are
(1) alkaline cleaning, (2) emulsion cleaning, (3) solvent cleaning, (4) acid cleaning, and
(5) ultrasonic cleaning. In some cases, chemical action is augmented by other energy
forms; for example, ultrasonic cleaning uses high-frequency mechanical vibrations combined with chemical cleaning. In the following paragraphs, we review these chemical
methods.
Alkaline cleaning is the most widely used industrial cleaning method. As its name
indicates, it employs an alkali to remove oils, grease, wax, and various types of particles
(metal chips, silica, carbon, and light scale) from a metallic surface. Alkaline cleaning
solutions consist of low-cost, water-soluble salts such as sodium and potassium hydroxide
(NaOH, KOH), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), borax (Na2B4O7), phosphates and silicates
of sodium and potassium, combined with dispersants and surfactants in water. The
cleaning method is commonly by immersion or spraying, usually at temperatures of 50 C
to 95 C (120 F–200 F). Following application of the alkaline solution, a water rinse is
used to remove the alkali residue. Metal surfaces cleaned by alkaline solutions are
typically electroplated or conversion coated.
Electrolytic cleaning, also called electrocleaning, is a related process in which a
3-V to 12-V direct current is applied to an alkaline cleaning solution. The electrolytic
action results in the generation of gas bubbles at the part surface, causing a scrubbing
action that aids in removal of tenacious dirt films.
Emulsion cleaning uses organic solvents (oils) dispersed in an aqueous solution.
The use of suitable emulsifiers (soaps) results in a two-phase cleaning fluid (oil-in-water),
which functions by dissolving or emulsifying the soils on the part surface. The process can
be used on either metal or nonmetallic parts. Emulsion cleaning must be followed by
alkaline cleaning to eliminate all residues of the organic solvent prior to plating.
In solvent cleaning, organic soils such as oil and grease are removed from a metallic
surface by means of chemicals that dissolve the soils. Common application techniques
include hand-wiping, immersion, spraying, and vapor degreasing. Vapor degreasing uses
hot vapors of solvents to dissolve and remove oil and grease on part surfaces. The common
solvents include trichlorethylene (C2HCl3), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), and perchlorethylene (C2Cl4), all of which have relatively low boiling points.1 The vapor degreasing
process consists of heating the liquid solvent to its boiling point in a container to produce
hot vapors. Parts to be cleaned are then introduced into the vapor, which condenses on the
relatively cold part surfaces, dissolving the contaminants and dripping to the bottom of the
container. Condensing coils near the top of the container prevent any vapors from escaping
the container into the surrounding atmosphere. This is important because these solvents are
classified as hazardous air pollutants under the 1992 Clean Air Act [10].
Acid cleaning removes oils and light oxides from metal surfaces by soaking,
spraying, or manual brushing or wiping. The process is carried out at ambient or elevated
temperatures. Common cleaning fluids are acid solutions combined with water-miscible
solvents, wetting and emulsifying agents. Cleaning acids include hydrochloric (HCl),
nitric (HNO3), phosphoric (H3PO4), and sulfuric (H2SO4), the selection depending on
the base metal and purpose of the cleaning. For example, phosphoric acid produces a light
phosphate film on the metallic surface, which can be a useful preparation for painting. A
closely related cleaning process is acid pickling, which involves a more severe treatment
to remove thicker oxides, rusts, and scales; it generally results in some etching of the
metallic surface, which serves to improve organic paint adhesion.
Ultrasonic cleaning combines chemical cleaning and mechanical agitation of the
cleaning fluid to provide a highly effective method for removing surface contaminants.
The cleaning fluid is generally an aqueous solution containing alkaline detergents. The

The highest boiling point of the three solvents is 121 C (250 F) for C2Cl4.

mechanical agitation is produced by high-frequency vibrations of sufficient amplitude to
cause cavitation—formation of low-pressure vapor bubbles or cavities. As the vibration
wave passes a given point in the liquid, the low-pressure region is followed by a highpressure front that implodes the cavity, thereby producing a shock wave capable of
penetrating contaminant particles adhering to the work surface. This rapid cycle of
cavitation and implosion occurs throughout the liquid medium, thus making ultrasonic
cleaning effective even on complex and intricate internal shapes. The cleaning process is
performed at frequencies between 20 and 45 kHz, and the cleaning solution is usually at
an elevated temperature, typically 65 C to 85 C (150 F–190 F).

28.1.2 MECHANICAL CLEANING AND SURFACE TREATMENTS
Mechanical cleaning involves the physical removal of soils, scales, or films from the work
surface of the workpart by means of abrasives or similar mechanical action. The processes
used for mechanical cleaning often serve other functions in addition to cleaning, such as
deburring and improving surface finish.

Blast Finishing and Shot Peening Blast finishing uses the high-velocity impact of
particulate media to clean and finish a surface. The most well known of these methods is
sand blasting, which uses grits of sand (SiO2) as the blasting media. Various other media
are also used in blast finishing, including hard abrasives such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3)
and silicon carbide (SiC), and soft media such as nylon beads and crushed nut shells. The
media is propelled at the target surface by pressurized air or centrifugal force. In some
applications, the process is performed wet, in which fine particles in a water slurry are
directed under hydraulic pressure at the surface.
In shot peening, a high-velocity stream of small cast steel pellets (called shot) is
directed at a metallic surface with the effect of cold working and inducing compressive
stresses into the surface layers. Shot peening is used primarily to improve fatigue strength
of metal parts. Its purpose is therefore different from blast finishing, although surface
cleaning is accomplished as a by-product of the operation.
Tumbling and Other Mass Finishing Tumbling, vibratory finishing, and similar
operations comprise a group of finishing processes known as mass finishing methods.
Mass finishing involves the finishing of parts in bulk by a mixing action inside a container,
usually in the presence of an abrasive media. The mixing causes the parts to rub against the
media and each other to achieve the desired finishing action. Mass finishing methods are
used for deburring, descaling, deflashing, polishing, radiusing, burnishing, and cleaning.
The parts include stampings, castings, forgings, extrusions, and machined parts. Even plastic
and ceramic parts are sometimes subjected to these mass finishing operations to achieve
desired finishing results. The parts processed by these methods are usually small and are
therefore uneconomical to finish individually.
Mass finishing methods include tumbling, vibratory finishing, and several techniques that utilize centrifugal force. Tumbling (also called barrel finishing and tumbling barrel finishing) involves the use of a horizontally oriented barrel of hexagonal or
octagonal cross-section in which parts are mixed by rotating the barrel at speeds of 10 to
50 rev/min. Finishing is performed by a ‘‘landslide’’ action of the media and parts as the
barrel revolves. As pictured in Figure 28.1, the contents rise in the barrel due to
rotation, followed by a tumbling down of the top layer due to gravity. This cycle of rising
and tumbling occurs continuously and, over time, subjects all of the parts to the same
desired finishing action. However, because only the top layer of parts is being finished
at any moment, barrel finishing is a relatively slow process compared to other mass
finishing methods. It often takes several hours of tumbling to complete the processing.

action of parts and

Other drawbacks of barrel finishing include high noise levels and large floor space
requirements.
Vibratory finishing was introduced in the late 1950s as an alternative to tumbling.
The vibrating vessel subjects all parts to agitation with the abrasive media, as opposed to
only the top layer as in barrel finishing. Consequently, processing times for vibratory
finishing are significantly reduced. The open tubs used in this method permit inspection
of the parts during processing, and noise is reduced.
Most of the media in these operations are abrasive; however, some media perform
nonabrasive finishing operations such as burnishing and surface hardening. The media may
be natural or synthetic materials. Natural media include corundum, granite, limestone, and
even hardwood. The problem with these materials is that they are generally softer (and
therefore wear more rapidly) and nonuniform in size (and sometimes clog in the workparts). Synthetic media can be made with greater consistency, both in size and hardness.
These materials include Al2O3 and SiC, compacted into a desired shape and size using a
bonding material such as a polyester resin. The shapes for these media include spheres,
cones, angle-cut cylinders, and other regular geometric forms, as in Figure 28.2(a). Steel is
also used as a mass finishing medium in shapes such as those shown in Figure 28.2(b) for
burnishing, surface hardening, and light deburring operations. The shapes shown in
Figure 28.2 come in various sizes. Selection of media is based on part size and shape, as
well as finishing requirements.
In most mass finishing processes, a compound is used with the media. The mass
finishing compound is a combination of chemicals for specific functions such as cleaning,
cooling, rust inhibiting (of steel parts and steel media), and enhancing brightness and
color of the parts (especially in burnishing).

673

DIFFUSION AND ION IMPLANTATION
In this section we discuss two processes in which the surface of a substrate is impregnated
with foreign atoms that alter its chemistry and properties.

28.2.1 DIFFUSION
Diffusion involves the alteration of surface layers of a material by diffusing atoms of a
different material (usually an element) into the surface (Section 4.3). The diffusion process
impregnates the surface layers of the substrate with the foreign element, but the surface still
contains a high proportion of substrate material. A typical profile of composition as a
function of depth below the surface for a diffusion coated metal part is illustrated in
Figure 28.3. The characteristic of a diffusion impregnated surface is that the diffused
element has a maximum percentage at the surface and rapidly declines with distance below
the surface. The diffusion process has important applications in metallurgy and semiconductor manufacture.
In metallurgical applications, diffusion is used to alter the surface chemistry of
metals in a number of processes and treatments. One important example is surface
hardening, typified by carburizing, nitriding, carbonitriding, chromizing, and boronizing (Section 27.4). In these treatments, one or more elements (C and/or Ni, Cr, or Bo) are
diffused into the surface of iron or steel.
There are other diffusion processes in which corrosion resistance and/or hightemperature oxidation resistance are main objectives. Aluminizing and siliconizing are
important examples. Aluminizing, also known as calorizing, involves diffusion of
aluminum into carbon steel, alloy steels, and alloys of nickel and cobalt. The treatment
is accomplished by either (1) pack diffusion, in which workparts are packed with Al
powders and baked at high temperature to create the diffusion layer; or (2) a slurry
method, in which the workparts are dipped or sprayed with a mixture of Al powders and
binders, then dried and baked.
Siliconizing is a treatment of steel in which silicon is diffused into the part surface to
create a layer with good corrosion and wear resistance and moderate heat resistance. The
treatment is carried out by heating the work in powders of silicon carbide (SiC) in an
atmosphere containing vapors of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4). Siliconizing is less common
than aluminizing.

as treated by ion implantation. (Source:
[17].) Shown here is a typical plot for boron
implanted in silicon. Note the difference in
profile shape and depth of altered layer
compared to diffusion in Figure 28.3.

Semiconductor Applications In semiconductor processing, diffusion of an impurity
element into the surface of a silicon chip is used to change the electrical properties at the
surface to create devices such as transistors and diodes. We examine how diffusion is used to
accomplish this doping, as it is called, and other semiconductor processes in Chapter 34.

28.2.2 ION IMPLANTATION
Ion implantation is an alternative to diffusion when the latter method is not feasible
because of the high temperatures required. The ion implantation process involves
embedding atoms of one (or more) foreign element(s) into a substrate surface using
a high-energy beam of ionized particles. The result is an alteration of the chemical and
physical properties of the layers near the substrate surface. Penetration of atoms
produces a much thinner altered layer than diffusion, as indicated by a comparison of
Figures 28.3 and 28.4. Also, the concentration profile of the impregnated element is quite
different from the characteristic diffusion profile.
Advantages of ion implantation include (1) low-temperature processing, (2) good
control and reproducibility of penetration depth of impurities, and (3) solubility limits can
be exceeded without precipitation of excess atoms. Ion implantation finds some of its
applications as a substitute for certain coating processes, where its advantages include
(4) no problems with waste disposal as in electroplating and many coating processes, and
(5) no discontinuity between coating and substrate. Principal applications of ion
implantation are in modifying metal surfaces to improve properties and fabrication of
semiconductor devices.

28.3 PLATING AND RELATED PROCESSES
Plating involves the coating of a thin metallic layer onto the surface of a substrate
material. The substrate is usually metallic, although methods are available to plate plastic
and ceramic parts. The most familiar and widely used plating technology is electroplating.

28.3.1 ELECTROPLATING
Electroplating, also known as electrochemical plating, is an electrolytic process (Section
4.5) in which metal ions in an electrolyte solution are deposited onto a cathode workpart.
The setup is shown in Figure 28.5. The anode is generally made of the metal being plated
and thus serves as the source of the plate metal. Direct current from an external power
supply is passed between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte is an aqueous
solution of acids, bases, or salts; it conducts electric current by the movement of plate
metal ions in solution. For optimum results, parts must be chemically cleaned just prior to
electroplating.

Principles of Electroplating Electrochemical plating is based on Faraday’s two
physical laws. Briefly for our purposes, the laws state: (1) the mass of a substance liberated
in electrolysis is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell; and
(2) the mass of the material liberated is proportional to its electrochemical equivalent
(ratio of atomic weight to valence). The effects can be summarized in the equation
V ¼ CIt

ð28:1Þ

where V ¼ volume of metal plated, mm3 (in3); C ¼ plating constant, which depends on
electrochemical equivalent and density, mm3/amp-s (in3/amp-min); I ¼ current, amps;
and t ¼ time during which current is applied, s (min). The product It (current  time) is
the electrical charge passed in the cell, and the value of C indicates the amount of
plating material deposited onto the cathodic workpart per electrical charge.
For most plating metals, not all of the electrical energy in the process is used for
deposition; some energy may be consumed in other reactions, such as the liberation of
hydrogen at the cathode. This reduces the amount of metal plated. The actual amount of
metal deposited on the cathode (workpart) divided by the theoretical amount given by
Eq. (28.1) is called the cathode efficiency. Taking the cathode efficiency into account, a
more realistic equation for determining the volume of metal plated is
V ¼ ECIt

ð28:2Þ

where E ¼ cathode efficiency, and the other terms are defined as before. Typical values
of cathode efficiency E and plating constant C for different metals are presented in
Table 28.1. The average plating thickness can be determined from the following:

Methods and Applications Avariety of equipment are available for electroplating, the
choice depending on part size and geometry, throughput requirements, and plating metal.
The principal methods are (1) barrel plating, (2) rack plating, and (3) strip plating. Barrel
plating is performed in rotating barrels that are oriented either horizontally or at an
oblique angle (35 ). The method is suited to the plating of many small parts in a batch.
Electrical contact is maintained through the tumbling action of the parts themselves and
by means of an externally connected conductor that projects into the barrel. There are
limitations to barrel plating; the tumbling action inherent in the process may damage soft
metal parts, threaded components, parts requiring good finishes, and heavy parts with
sharp edges.
Rack plating is used for parts that are too large, heavy, or complex for barrel plating.
The racks are made of heavy-gauge copper wire, formed into suitable shapes for holding the
parts and conducting current to them. The racks are fabricated so that workparts can be hung
on hooks, or held by clips, or loaded into baskets. To avoid plating of the copper itself, the
racks are covered with insulation except in locations where part contact occurs. The racks
containing the parts are moved through a sequence of tanks that perform the electroplating
operation. Strip plating is a high-production method in which the work consists of a

continuous strip that is pulled through the plating solution by means of a take-up reel. Plated
wire is an example of a suitable application. Small sheet-metal parts held in a long strip can
also be plated by this method. The process can be set up so that only specific regions of the
parts are plated, for example, contact points plated with gold on electrical connectors.
Common coating metals in electroplating include zinc, nickel, tin, copper, and
chromium. Steel is the most common substrate metal. Precious metals (gold, silver,
platinum) are plated on jewelry. Gold is also used for electrical contacts.
Zinc-plated steel products include fasteners, wire goods, electric switch boxes, and
various sheet-metal parts. The zinc coating serves as a sacrificial barrier to the corrosion of
the steel beneath. An alternative process for coating zinc onto steel is galvanizing (Section
28.3.4). Nickel plating is used for corrosion resistance and decorative purposes over steel,
brass, zinc die castings, and other metals. Applications include automotive trim and other
consumer goods. Nickel is also used as a base coat under a much thinner chrome plate. Tin
plate is still widely used for corrosion protection in ‘‘tin cans’’ and other food containers.
Tin plate is also used to improve solderability of electrical components.
Copper has several important applications as a plating metal. It is widely used as a
decorative coating on steel and zinc, either alone or alloyed with zinc as brass plate. It also
has important plating applications in printed circuit boards (Section 35.2). Finally, copper is
often plated on steel as a base beneath nickel and/or chrome plate. Chromium plate
(popularly known as chrome plate) is valued for its decorative appearance and is widely
used in automotive products, office furniture, and kitchen appliances. It also produces one
of the hardest of all electroplated coatings, and so it is widely used for parts requiring wear
resistance (e.g., hydraulic pistons and cylinders, piston rings, aircraft engine components,
and thread guides in textile machinery).

28.3.2 ELECTROFORMING
This process is virtually the same as electroplating but its purpose is quite different.
Electroforming involves electrolytic deposition of metal onto a pattern until the required
thickness is achieved; the pattern is then removed to leave the formed part. Whereas
typical plating thickness is only about 0.05 mm (0.002 in) or less, electroformed parts are
often substantially thicker, so the production cycle is proportionally longer.
Patterns used in electroforming are either solid or expendable. Solid patterns have a
taper or other geometry that permits removal of the electroplated part. Expendable
patterns are destroyed during part removal; they are used when part shape precludes a
solid pattern. Expendable patterns are either fusible or soluble. The fusible type is made of
low-melting alloys, plastic, wax, or other material that can be removed by melting. When
nonconductive materials are used, the pattern must be metallized to accept the electrodeposited coating. Soluble patterns are made of a material that can be readily dissolved by
chemicals; for example, aluminum can be dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
Electroformed parts are commonly fabricated of copper, nickel, and nickel cobalt
alloys. Applications include fine molds for lenses, compact discs (CDs), and videodiscs
(DVDs); copper foil used to produce blank printed circuit boards; and plates for embossing
and printing. Molds for compact discs and videodiscs represent a demanding application
because the surface details that must be imprinted on the disc are measured in mm (1 mm ¼
106 m). These details are readily obtained in the mold by electroforming.

28.3.3 ELECTROLESS PLATING
Electroless plating is a plating process driven entirely by chemical reactions—no external
source of electric current is required. Deposition of metal onto a part surface occurs in an

E1C28

Page 678

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

aqueous solution containing ions of the desired plating metal. The process uses a reducing
agent, and the workpart surface acts as a catalyst for the reaction.
The metals that can be electroless plated are limited; and for those that can be
processed by this technique, the cost is generally greater than electrochemical plating. The
most common electroless plating metal is nickel and certain of its alloys (Ni–Co, Ni–P, and
Ni–B). Copper and, to a lesser degree, gold are also used as plating metals. Nickel plating by
this process is used for applications requiring high resistance to corrosion and wear.
Electroless copper plating is used to plate through holes of printed circuit boards (Section
35.2.4). Cu can also be plated onto plastic parts for decorative purposes. Advantages
sometimes cited for electroless plating include (1) uniform plate thickness on complex part
geometries (a problem with electroplating); (2) the process can be used on both metallic
and nonmetallic substrates; and (3) no need for a DC power supply to drive the process.

28.3.4 HOT DIPPING
Hot dipping is a process in which a metal substrate is immersed in a molten bath of a
second metal; upon removal, the second metal is coated onto the first. Of course, the first
metal must possess a higher melting temperature than the second. The most common
substrate metals are steel and iron. Zinc, aluminum, tin, and lead are the common coating
metals. Hot dipping works by forming transition layers of varying alloy compositions.
Next to the substrate are normally intermetallic compounds of the two metals; at the
exterior are solid solution alloys consisting predominantly of the coating metal. The
transition layers provide excellent adhesion of the coating.
The primary purpose of hot dipping is corrosion protection. Two mechanisms
normally operate to provide this protection: (1) barrier protection—the coating simply
serves as a shield for the metal beneath; and (2) sacrificial protection—the coating
corrodes by a slow electrochemical process to preserve the substrate.
Hot dipping goes by different names, depending on coating metal: galvanizing is
when zinc (Zn) is coated onto steel or iron; aluminizing refers to coating of aluminum
(Al) onto a substrate; tinning is coating of tin (Sn); and terneplate describes the plating of
lead–tin alloy onto steel. Galvanizing is by far the most important hot dipping process,
dating back about 200 years. It is applied to finished steel and iron parts in a batch
process; and to sheet, strip, piping, tubing, and wire in an automated continuous process.
Coating thickness is typically 0.04 to 0.09 mm (0.0016–0.0035 in). Thickness is controlled
largely by immersion time. Bath temperature is maintained at around 450 C (850 F).
Commercial use of aluminizing is on the rise, gradually increasing in market share
relative to galvanizing. Hot-dipped aluminum coatings provide excellent corrosion
protection, in some cases five times more effective than galvanizing [17]. Tin plating
by hot dipping provides a nontoxic corrosion protection for steel in applications for food
containers, dairy equipment, and soldering applications. Hot dipping has gradually been
overtaken by electroplating as the preferred commercial method for plating of tin onto
steel. Terneplating involves hot dipping of a lead–tin alloy onto steel. The alloy is
predominantly lead (only 2%–15% Sn); however, tin is required to obtain satisfactory
adhesion of the coating. Terneplate is the lowest cost of the coating methods for steel, but
its corrosion protection is limited.

28.4 CONVERSION COATING
Conversion coating refers to a family of processes in which a thin film of oxide,
phosphate, or chromate is formed on a metallic surface by chemical or electrochemical
reaction. Immersion and spraying are the two common methods of exposing the metal

E1C28

Section 28.4/Conversion Coating

679

surface to the reacting chemicals. The common metals treated by conversion coating are
steel (including galvanized steel), zinc, and aluminum. However, nearly any metal
product can benefit from the treatment. The important reasons for using a conversion
coating process are (1) to provide corrosion protection, (2) to prepare the surface for
painting, (3) to increase wear resistance, (4) to permit the surface to better hold lubricants
for metal forming processes, (5) to increase electrical resistance of surface, (6) to provide
a decorative finish, and (7) for part identification [17].
Conversion coating processes divide into two categories: (1) chemical treatments,
which involve a chemical reaction only, and (2) anodizing, which consists of an electrochemical reaction to produce an oxide coating (anodize is a contraction of anodic
oxidize).

28.4.1 CHEMICAL CONVERSION COATINGS
These processes expose the base metal to certain chemicals that form thin, nonmetallic
surface films. Similar reactions occur in nature; the oxidation of iron and aluminum are
examples. Whereas rusting is progressively destructive of iron, formation of a thin Al2O3
coating on aluminum protects the base metal. It is the purpose of these chemical
conversion treatments to accomplish the latter effect. The two main processes are
phosphate and chromate coating.
Phosphate coating transforms the base metal surface into a protective phosphate
film by exposure to solutions of certain phosphate salts (e.g., Zn, Mg, and Ca) together
with dilute phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The coatings range in thickness from 0.0025 to 0.05
mm (0.0001–0.002 in). The most common base metals are zinc and steel, including
galvanized steel. The phosphate coating serves as a useful preparation for painting in the
automotive and heavy appliance industries.
Chromate coating converts the base metal into various forms of chromate films
using aqueous solutions of chromic acid, chromate salts, and other chemicals. Metals
treated by this method include aluminum, cadmium, copper, magnesium, and zinc (and
their alloys). Immersion of the base part is the common method of application. Chromate
conversion coatings are somewhat thinner than phosphate, typically less than 0.0025 mm
(0.0001 in). Usual reasons for chromate coating are (1) corrosion protection, (2) base for
painting, and (3) decorative purposes. Chromate coatings can be clear or colorful;
available colors include olive drab, bronze, yellow, or bright blue.

28.4.2 ANODIZING
Although the previous processes are normally performed without electrolysis, anodizing
is an electrolytic treatment that produces a stable oxide layer on a metallic surface. Its
most common applications are with aluminum and magnesium, but it is also applied to
zinc, titanium, and other less common metals. Anodized coatings are used primarily for
decorative purposes; they also provide corrosion protection.
It is instructive to compare anodizing to electroplating, since they are both electrolytic processes. Two differences stand out. (1) In electrochemical plating, the workpart to
be coated is the cathode in the reaction. By contrast, in anodizing, the work is the anode,
whereas the processing tank is cathodic. (2) In electroplating, the coating is grown by
adhesion of ions of a second metal to the base metal surface. In anodizing, the surface
coating is formed through chemical reaction of the substrate metal into an oxide layer.
Anodized coatings usually range in thickness between 0.0025 and 0.075 mm (0.0001
and 0.003 in). Dyes can be incorporated into the anodizing process to create a wide
variety of colors; this is especially common in aluminum anodizing. Very thick coatings up

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

to 0.25 mm (0.010 in) can also be formed on aluminum by a special process called hard
anodizing; these coatings are noted for high resistance to wear and corrosion.

28.5 VAPOR DEPOSITION PROCESSES
The vapor deposition processes form a thin coating on a substrate by either condensation or
chemical reaction of a gas onto the surface of the substrate. The two categories of processes
that fall under this heading are physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition.

28.5.1 PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a group of thin film processes in which a material is
converted into its vapor phase in a vacuum chamber and condensed onto a substrate surface
as a very thin layer. PVD can be used to apply a wide variety of coating materials: metals,
alloys, ceramics and other inorganic compounds, and even certain polymers. Possible
substrates include metals, glass, and plastics. Thus, PVD represents a versatile coating technology, applicable to an almost unlimited combination of coating substances and substrate
materials.
Applications of PVD include thin decorative coatings on plastic and metal parts such
as trophies, toys, pens and pencils, watchcases, and interior trim in automobiles. The
coatings are thin films of aluminum (around 150 nm) coated with clear lacquer to give a high
gloss silver or chrome appearance. Another use of PVD is to apply antireflection coatings
of magnesium fluoride (MgF2) onto optical lenses. PVD is applied in the fabrication of
electronic devices, principally for depositing metal to form electrical connections in
integrated circuits. Finally, PVD is widely used to coat titanium nitride (TiN) onto cutting
tools and plastic injection molds for wear resistance.
All physical vapor deposition processes consist of the following steps: (1) synthesis
of the coating vapor, (2) vapor transport to the substrate, and (3) condensation of vapors
onto the substrate surface. These steps are generally carried out inside a vacuum
chamber, so evacuation of the chamber must precede the actual PVD process.
Synthesis of the coating vapor can be accomplished by any of several methods, such
as electric resistance heating or ion bombardment to vaporize an existing solid (or liquid).
These and other variations result in several PVD processes. They are grouped into three
principal types: (1) vacuum evaporation, (2) sputtering, and (3) ion plating. Table 28.2
presents a summary of these processes.

FIGURE 28.6 Setup for

deposition.

Vacuum Evaporation Certain materials (mostly pure metals) can be deposited onto a
substrate by first transforming them from solid to vapor state in a vacuum and then letting
them condense on the substrate surface. The setup for the vacuum evaporation process is
shown in Figure 28.6. The material to be deposited, called the source, is heated to a
sufficiently high temperature that it evaporates (or sublimes). Since heating is accomplished in a vacuum, the temperature required for vaporization is significantly below the
corresponding temperature required at atmospheric pressure. Also, the absence of air in
the chamber prevents oxidation of the source material at the heating temperatures.
Various methods can be used to heat and vaporize the material. A container must be
provided to hold the source material before vaporization. Among the important vaporization methods are resistance heating and electron beam bombardment. Resistance heating
is the simplest technology. A refractory metal (e.g., W, Mo) is formed into a suitable
container to hold the source material. Current is applied to heat the container, which then
heats the material in contact with it. One problem with this heating method is possible
alloying between the holder and its contents, so that the deposited film becomes contaminated with the metal of the resistance heating container. In electron beam evaporation, a
stream of electrons at high velocity is directed to bombard the surface of the source material
to cause vaporization. By contrast with resistance heating, very little energy acts to heat the
container, thus minimizing contamination of the container material with the coating.
Whatever the vaporization technique, evaporated atoms leave the source and follow
straight-line paths until they collide with other gas molecules or strike a solid surface. The
vacuum inside the chamber virtually eliminates other gas molecules, thus reducing the
probability of collisions with source vapor atoms. The substrate surface to be coated is usually
positioned relative to the source so that it is the likely solid surface on which the vapor atoms
will be deposited. A mechanical manipulator is sometimes used to rotate the substrate so that
all surfaces are coated. Upon contact with the relative cool substrate surface, the energy level
of the impinging atoms is suddenly reduced to the point where they cannot remain in a vapor
state; they condense and become attached to the solid surface, forming a deposited thin film.
Sputtering If the surface of a solid (or liquid) is bombarded by atomic particles of
sufficiently high energy, individual atoms of the surface may acquire enough energy due to
the collision that they are ejected from the surface by transfer of momentum. This is the
process known as sputtering. The most convenient form of high energy particle is an ionized
gas, such as argon, energized by means of an electric field to form a plasma. As a PVD process,
sputtering involves bombardment of the cathodic coating material with argon ions (Ar+),
causing surface atoms to escape and then be deposited onto a substrate, forming a thin film on

the substrate surface. The substrate must be placed close to the cathode and is usually heated
to improve bonding of the coating atoms. A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 28.7.
Whereas vacuum evaporation is generally limited to metals, sputtering can be
applied to nearly any material—metallic and nonmetallic elements; alloys, ceramics, and
polymers. Films of alloys and compounds can be sputtered without changing their
chemical compositions. Films of chemical compounds can also be deposited by employing reactive gases that form oxides, carbides, or nitrides with the sputtered metal.
Drawbacks of sputtering PVD include (1) slow deposition rates and (2) since the
ions bombarding the surface are a gas, traces of the gas can usually be found in the coated
films, and the entrapped gases sometimes affect mechanical properties adversely.

Ion Plating Ion plating uses a combination of sputtering and vacuum evaporation to
deposit a thin film onto a substrate. The process works as follows. The substrate is set up
to be the cathode in the upper part of the chamber, and the source material is placed
below it. A vacuum is then established in the chamber. Argon gas is admitted and an
electric field is applied to ionize the gas (Ar+) and establish a plasma. This results in ion
bombardment (sputtering) of the substrate so that its surface is scrubbed to a condition of
atomic cleanliness (interpret this as ‘‘very clean’’). Next, the source material is heated
sufficiently to generate coating vapors. The heating methods used here are similar to
those used in vacuum evaporation: resistance heating, electron beam bombardment, and
so on. The vapor molecules pass through the plasma and coat the substrate. Sputtering is
continued during deposition, so that the ion bombardment consists not only of the
original argon ions but also source material ions that have been energized while being
subjected to the same energy field as the argon. The effect of these processing conditions
is to produce films of uniform thickness and excellent adherence to the substrate.
Ion plating is applicable to parts having irregular geometries, due to the scattering
effects that exist in the plasma field. An example of interest here is TiN coating of highspeed steel cutting tools (e.g., drill bits). In addition to coating uniformity and good
adherence, other advantages of the process include high deposition rates, high film
densities, and the capability to coat the inside walls of holes and other hollow shapes.

28.5.2 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Physical vapor deposition involves deposition of a coating by condensation onto a substrate
from the vapor phase; it is strictly a physical process. By comparison, chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) involves the interaction between a mixture of gases and the surface of a

E1C28

Section 28.5/Vapor Deposition Processes

heated substrate, causing chemical decomposition of some of the gas constituents and
formation of a solid film on the substrate. The reactions take place in an enclosed reaction
chamber. The reaction product (either a metal or a compound) nucleates and grows on the
substrate surface to form the coating. Most CVD reactions require heat. However,
depending on the chemicals involved, the reactions can be driven by other possible energy
sources, such as ultraviolet light or plasma. CVD includes a wide range of pressures and
temperatures; and it can be applied to a great variety of coating and substrate materials.
Industrial metallurgical processes based on chemical vapor deposition date back to
the 1800s (e.g., the Mond process in Table 28.3). Modern interest in CVD is focused on its
coating applications such as coated cemented carbide tools, solar cells, depositing
refractory metals on jet engine turbine blades, and other applications where resistance
to wear, corrosion, erosion, and thermal shock are important. In addition, CVD is an
important technology in integrated circuit fabrication.
Advantages typically cited for CVD include (1) capability to deposit refractory
materials at temperatures below their melting or sintering temperatures; (2) control of
grain size is possible; (3) the process is carried out at atmospheric pressure—it does not

require vacuum equipment; and (4) good bonding of coating to substrate surface [1].
Disadvantages include (1) corrosive and/or toxic nature of chemicals generally necessitates a closed chamber as well as special pumping and disposal equipment; (2) certain
reaction ingredients are relatively expensive; and (3) material utilization is low.

CVD Materials and Reactions In general, metals that are readily electroplated are not
good candidates for CVD, owing to the hazardous chemicals that must be used and the costs
of safeguarding against them. Metals suitable for coating by CVD include tungsten,
molybdenum, titanium, vanadium, and tantalum. Chemical vapor deposition is especially
suited to the deposition of compounds, such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon dioxide
(SiO2), silicon nitride (Si3N4), titanium carbide (TiC), and titanium nitride (TiN). Figure 28.8 illustrates the application of both CVD and PVD to provide multiple wearresistant coatings on a cemented carbide cutting tool.
The commonly used reacting gases or vapors are metallic hydrides (MHx), chlorides
(MClx), fluorides (MFx), and carbonyls (M(CO)x), where M ¼ the metal to be deposited
and x is used to balance the valences in the compound. Other gases, such as hydrogen (H2),
nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia (NH3) are used in
some of the reactions. Table 28.3 presents some examples of CVD reactions that result in
deposition of a metal or ceramic coating onto a suitable substrate. Typical temperatures at
which these reactions are carried out are also given.
Processing Equipment Chemical vapor deposition processes are carried out in a reactor, which consists of (1) reactant supply system, (2) deposition chamber, and (3) recycle/
disposal system. Although reactor configurations differ depending on the application,
one possible CVD reactor is illustrated in Figure 28.9. The purpose of the reactant supply
system is to deliver reactants to the deposition chamber in the proper proportions.

685

FIGURE 28.9 A typical
reactor used in chemical
vapor deposition.

Different types of supply system are required, depending on whether the reactants are
delivered as gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., pellets, powders).
The deposition chamber contains the substrates and chemical reactions that lead to
deposition of reaction products onto the substrate surfaces. Deposition occurs at elevated
temperatures, and the substrate must be heated by induction heating, radiant heat, or other
means. Deposition temperatures for different CVD reactions range from 250 C to 1950 C
(500 F–3500 F), so the chamber must be designed to meet these temperature demands.
The third component of the reactor is the recycle/disposal system, whose function is to
render harmless the byproducts of the CVD reaction. This includes collection of materials
that are toxic, corrosive, and/or flammable, followed by proper processing and disposition.

Alternative Forms of CVD What we have described is atmospheric pressure chemical
vapor deposition, in which the reactions are carried out at or near atmospheric pressure. For
many reactions, there are advantages in performing the process at pressures well below
atmospheric. This is called low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), in which the
reactions occur in a partial vacuum. Advantages of LPCVD include (1) uniform thickness,
(2) good control over composition and structure, (3) low-temperature processing, (4) fast
deposition rates, and (5) high throughput and lower processing costs [13]. The technical
problem in LPCVD is designing the vacuum pumps to create the partial vacuum when the
reaction products are not only hot but may also be corrosive. These pumps must often include
systems to cool and trap the corrosive gases before they reach the actual pumping unit.
Another variation of CVD is plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD),
in which deposition onto a substrate is accomplished by reacting the ingredients in a gas that
has been ionized by means of an electric discharge (i.e., a plasma). In effect, the energy
contained in the plasma rather than thermal energy is used to activate the chemical reactions.
Advantages of PACVD include (1) lower substrate temperatures, (2) better covering
power, (3) better adhesion, and (4) faster deposition rates [6]. Applications include
deposition of silicon nitride (Si3N4) in semiconductor processing, TiN and TiC coatings for
tools, and polymer coatings. The process is also known as plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition, plasma chemical vapor deposition, or just simply plasma deposition.

28.6

ORGANIC COATINGS
Organic coatings are polymers and resins, produced either naturally or synthetically,
usually formulated to be applied as liquids that dry or harden as thin surface films on
substrate materials. These coatings are valued for the variety of colors and textures

E1C28

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

possible, their capacity to protect the substrate surface, low cost, and ease with which they
can be applied. In this section, we consider the compositions of organic coatings and the
methods to apply them. Although most organic coatings are applied in liquid form, some
are applied as powders; we consider this alternative in Section 28.6.2.
Organic coatings are formulated to contain the following: (1) binders, which
give the coating its properties; (2) dyes or pigments, which lend color to the coating;
(3) solvents, to dissolve the polymers and resins and add proper fluidity to the liquid; and
(4) additives.
Binders in organic coatings are polymers and resins that determine the solid-state
properties of the coating, such as strength, physical properties, and adhesion to the
substrate surface. The binder holds the pigments and other ingredients in the coating
during and after application to the surface. The most common binders in organic coatings
are natural oils (used to produce oil-based paints), and resins of polyesters, polyurethanes, epoxies, acrylics, and cellulosics.
Dyes and pigments provide color to the coating. Dyes are soluble chemicals that color
the coating liquid but do not conceal the surface beneath. Thus, dye-colored coatings are
generally transparent or translucent. Pigments are solid particles of uniform, microscopic
size that are dispersed in the coating liquid but insoluble in it. They not only color the
coating; they also hide the surface below. Since pigments are particulate matter, they also
tend to strengthen the coating.
Solvents are used to dissolve the binder and certain other ingredients in the liquid
coating composition. Common solvents used in organic coatings are aliphatic and aromatic
hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones, and chlorinated solvents. Different solvents are
required for different binders. Additives in organic coatings include surfactants (to facilitate
spreading on the surface), biocides and fungicides, thickeners, freeze/thaw stabilizers, heat
and light stabilizers, coalescing agents, plasticizers, defoamers, and catalysts to promote
cross-linking. These ingredients are formulated to obtain a wide variety of coatings, such as
paints, lacquers, and varnishes.

28.6.1 APPLICATION METHODS
The method of applying an organic coating to a surface depends on factors such as
composition of the coating liquid, required thickness of the coating, production rate and
cost considerations, part size, and environmental requirements. For any of the application
methods, it is of utmost importance that the surface be properly prepared. This includes
cleaning and possible treatment of the surface such as phosphate coating. In some cases,
metallic surfaces are plated prior to organic coating for maximum corrosion protection.
With any coating method, transfer efficiency is a critical measure. Transfer efficiency
is the proportion of paint supplied to the process that is actually deposited onto the work
surface. Some methods yield as low as a 30% transfer efficiency (meaning that 70% of the
paint is wasted and cannot be recovered).
Available methods of applying liquid organic coatings include brushing and rolling,
spray coating, immersion, and flow coating. In some cases, several successive coatings are
applied to the substrate surface to achieve the desired result. An automobile car body is
an important example; the following is a typical sequence applied to the sheet-metal car
body in a mass-production automobile: (1) phosphate coat applied by dipping, (2) primer
coat applied by dipping, (3) color paint coat applied by spray coating, and (4) clear coat
(for high gloss and added protection) applied by spraying.
Brushing and rolling are the two most familiar application methods to most people.
They have a high transfer efficiency—approaching 100%. Manual brushing and rolling
methods are suited to low production but not mass production. While brushing is quite versatile, rolling is limited to flat surfaces.

Section 28.6/Organic Coatings

687

Spray coating is a widely used production method for applying organic coatings.
The process forces the coating liquid to atomize into a fine mist immediately prior to
deposition onto the part surface. When the droplets hit the surface, they spread and flow
together to form a uniform coating within the localized region of the spray. If done
properly, spray coating provides a uniform coating over the entire work surface.
Spray coating can be performed manually in spray painting booths, or it can be set up
as an automated process. Transfer efficiency is relatively low (as low as 30%) with these
methods. Efficiency can be improved by electrostatic spraying, in which the workpart is
grounded electrically and the atomized droplets are electrostatically charged. This causes
the droplets to be drawn to the part surfaces, increasing transfer efficiencies to values up to
90% [17]. Spraying is utilized extensively in the automotive industry for applying external
paint coats to car bodies. It is also used for coating appliances and other consumer products.
Immersion applies large amounts of liquid coating to the workpart and allows the
excess to drain off and be recycled. The simplest method is dip coating, in which a part is
immersed in an open tank of liquid coating material; when the part is withdrawn, the
excess liquid drains back into the tank. A variation of dip coating is electrocoating, in
which the part is electrically charged and then dipped into a paint bath that has been
given an opposite charge. This improves adhesion and permits use of water-based paints
(which reduce fire and pollution hazards).
In flow coating, workparts are moved through an enclosed paint booth, where a
series of nozzles shower the coating liquid onto the part surfaces. Excess liquid drains
back into a sump, which allows it to be reused.
Once applied, the organic coating must convert from liquid to solid. The term
drying is often used to describe this conversion process. Many organic coatings dry by
evaporation of their solvents. However, in order to form a durable film on the substrate
surface, a further conversion is necessary, called curing. Curing involves a chemical
change in the organic resin in which polymerization or cross-linking occurs to harden the
coating.
The type of resin determines the type of chemical reaction that takes place in
curing. The principal methods by which curing is effected in organic coatings are [17] (1)
ambient temperature curing, which involves evaporation of the solvent and oxidation of
the resin (most lacquers cure by this method); (2) elevated temperature curing, in which
elevated temperatures are used to accelerate solvent evaporation, as well as polymerization and cross-linking of the resin; (3) catalytic curing, in which the starting resins
require reactive agents mixed immediately prior to application to bring about polymerization and cross-linking (epoxy and polyurethane paints are examples); and (4) radiation
curing, in which various forms of radiation, such as microwaves, ultraviolet light, and
electron beams, are required to cure the resin.

28.6.2 POWDER COATING
The organic coatings discussed above are liquid systems consisting of resins that are
soluble (or at least miscible) in a suitable solvent. Powder coatings are different. They are
applied as dry, finely pulverized, solid particles that are melted on the surface to form a
uniform liquid film, after which they resolidify into a dry coating. Powder coating systems
have grown significantly in commercial importance among organic coatings since the
mid-1970s.
Powder coatings are classified as thermoplastic or thermosetting. Common
thermoplastic powders include polyvinylchloride, nylon, polyester, polyethylene,
and polypropylene. They are generally applied as relatively thick coatings, 0.08 to
0.30 mm (0.003–0.012 in). Common thermosetting coating powders are epoxy, polyester, and acrylic. They are applied as uncured resins that polymerize and cross-link on

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

heating or reaction with other ingredients. Coating thicknesses are typically 0.025 to
0.075 mm (0.001–0.003 in).
There are two principal application methods for powder coatings: spraying and
fluidized bed. In the spraying method, an electrostatic charge is given to each particle in
order to attract it to an electrically grounded part surface. Several spray gun designs are
available to impart the charge to the powders. The spray guns can be operated manually
or by industrial robots. Compressed air is used to propel the powders to the nozzle. The
powders are dry when sprayed, and any excess particles that do not attach to the surface
can be recycled (unless multiple paint colors are mixed in the same spray booth). Powders
can be sprayed onto a part at room temperature, followed by heating of the part to melt
the powders; or they can be sprayed onto a part that has been heated to above the melting
point of the powder, which usually provides a thicker coating.
The fluidized bed is a less commonly used alternative to electrostatic spraying. In
this method, the workpart to be coated is preheated and passed through a fluidized bed,
in which powders are suspended (fluidized) by an airstream. The powders attach
themselves to the part surface to form the coating. In some implementations of this
coating method, the powders are electrostatically charged to increase attraction to the
grounded part surface.

28.7 PORCELAIN ENAMELING AND OTHER CERAMIC COATINGS
Porcelain is a ceramic made from kaolin, feldspar, and quartz (Chapter 7). It can be applied
to substrate metals such as steel, cast iron, and aluminum as a vitreous porcelain enamel.
Porcelain coatings are valued for their beauty, color, smoothness, ease of cleaning,
chemical inertness, and general durability. Porcelain enameling is the name given to
the technology of these ceramic coating materials and the processes by which they are
applied.
Porcelain enameling is used in a wide variety of products, including bathroom
fixtures (e.g., sinks, bathtubs, lavatories), household appliances (e.g., ranges, water heaters,
washing machines, dishwashers), kitchen ware, hospital utensils, jet engine components,
automotive mufflers, and electronic circuit boards. Compositions of the porcelains vary,
depending on product requirements. Some porcelains are formulated for color and beauty,
while others are designed for functions such as resistance to chemicals and weather, ability
to withstand high service temperatures, hardness and abrasion resistance, and electrical
resistance.
As a process, porcelain enameling consists of (1) preparing the coating material,
(2) applying to the surface, (3) drying, if needed, and (4) firing. Preparation involves
converting the glassy porcelain into fine particles, called frit, that are milled to proper and
consistent size. The methods for applying the frit are similar to methods used for applying
organic coatings, even though the starting material is entirely different. Some application
methods involve mixing frit with water as a carrier (the mixture is called a slip), while
other methods apply the porcelain as dry powder. The techniques include spraying,
electrostatic spraying, flow coating, dipping, and electrodeposition. Firing is accomplished at temperatures around 800 C (1500 F). Firing is a sintering process (Section
17.1.4) in which the frit is transformed into nonporous vitreous porcelain. Coating
thickness ranges from around 0.075 to 2 mm (0.08–0.003 in). The processing sequence
may be repeated several times to obtain the desired thickness.
In addition to porcelain, other ceramics are used as coatings for special purposes.
These coatings usually contain a high content of alumina, which makes them more suited to
refractory applications. Techniques for applying the coatings are similar to the preceding,
except firing temperatures are higher.

Section 28.8/Thermal and Mechanical Coating Processes

28.8

689

THERMAL AND MECHANICAL COATING PROCESSES
These processes apply discrete coatings that are generally thicker than coatings deposited
by other processes considered in this chapter. They are based on either thermal or
mechanical energy.

28.8.1 THERMAL SURFACING PROCESSES
These methods use thermal energy in various forms to apply a coating whose function is to
provide resistance to corrosion, erosion, wear, and high temperature oxidation. The
processes include (1) thermal spraying, (2) hard facing, and (3) the flexible overlay process.
In thermal spraying, molten and semimolten coating materials are sprayed onto a
substrate, where they solidify and adhere to the surface. A wide variety of coating
materials can be applied; the categories are pure metals and metal alloys; ceramics
(oxides, carbides, and certain glasses); other metallic compounds (sulfides, silicides);
cermet composites; and certain plastics (epoxy, nylon, Teflon, and others). The substrates
include metals, ceramics, glass, some plastics, wood, and paper. Not all coatings can be
applied to all substrates. When the process is used to apply a metallic coating, the terms
metallizing or metal spraying are used.
Technologies used to heat the coating material are oxyfuel flame, electric arc, and
plasma arc. The starting coating material is in the form of wire or rod, or powders. When
wire (or rod) is used, the heating source melts the leading end of the wire, thereby
separating it from the solid stock. The molten material is then atomized by a high-velocity
gas stream (compressed air or other source), and the droplets are spattered against the work
surface. When powder stock is used, a powder feeder dispenses the fine particles into a gas
stream, which transports them into the flame, where they are melted. The expanding gases
in the flame propel the molten (or semimolten) powders against the workpiece. Coating
thickness in thermal spraying is generally greater than in other deposition processes; the
typical range is 0.05 to 2.5 mm (0.002–0.100 in).
The first applications of thermal spray coating were to rebuild worn areas on used
machinery components and to salvage workparts that had been machined undersize.
Success of the technique has led to its use in manufacturing as a coating process
for corrosion resistance, high temperature protection, wear resistance, electrical
conductivity, electrical resistance, electromagnetic interference shielding, and other
functions.
Hard facing is a surfacing technique in which alloys are applied as welded deposits
to substrate metals. What distinguishes hard facing is that fusion occurs between the
coating and the substrate, as in fusion welding (Chapter 29), whereas the bond in thermal
spraying is typically mechanical interlocking that does not stand up as well to abrasive
wear. Thus, hard facing is especially suited to components requiring good wear resistance.
Applications include coating new parts and repairing used part surfaces that are heavily
worn, eroded, or corroded. An advantage of hard facing that should be mentioned is that
it is readily accomplished outside of the relatively controlled factory environment by
many of the common welding processes, such as oxyacetylene gas welding and arc
welding. Some of the common surfacing materials include steel and iron alloys, cobaltbased alloys, and nickel-based alloys. Coating thickness is usually 0.75 to 2.5 mm (0.030–
0.125 in), although thicknesses as great as 9 mm (3/8 in) are possible.
The flexible overlay process is capable of depositing a very hard coating material,
such as tungsten carbide (WC), onto a substrate surface. This is an important advantage
of the process compared to other methods, permitting coating hardness up to about 70
Rockwell C. The process can also be used to apply coatings only to selected regions of a

E1C28

Chapter 28/Surface Processing Operations

workpart. In the flexible overlay process, a cloth impregnated with hard ceramic or
metal powders and another cloth impregnated with brazing alloy are laid onto a
substrate and heated to fuse the powders to the surface. Thickness of overlay coatings
is usually 0.25 to 2.5 mm (0.010–0.100 in). In addition to coatings of WC and WC–Co,
cobalt-based and nickel-based alloys are also applied. Applications include chain saw
teeth, rock drill bits, oil drill collars, extrusion dies, and similar parts requiring good
wear resistance.

28.8.2 MECHANICAL PLATING
In this coating process, mechanical energy is used to build a metallic coating onto the
surface. In mechanical plating, the parts to be coated, together with plating metal
powders, glass beads, and special chemicals to promote the plating action, are tumbled
in a barrel. The metallic powders are microscopic in size—5 mm (0.0002 in) in diameter;
while the glass beads are much larger—2.5 mm (0.10 in) in diameter. As the mixture is
tumbled, the mechanical energy from the rotating barrel is transmitted through the glass
beads to pound the metal powders against the part surface, causing a mechanical or
metallurgical bond to result. The deposited metals must be malleable in order to achieve
a satisfactory bond with the substrate. Plating metals include zinc, cadmium, tin, and lead.
The term mechanical galvanizing is used for parts that are zinc coated. Ferrous metals
are most commonly coated; other metals include brass and bronze. Typical applications
include fasteners such as screws, bolts, nuts, and nails. Plating thickness in mechanical
plating is usually 0.005 to 0.025 mm (0.0002–0.001 in). Zinc is mechanically plated to a
thickness of around 0.075 mm (0.003 in).

In this part of the book, we consider the processes that are
used to join two or more parts into an assembled entity.
These processes are labeled in the lower stem of Figure 1.4.
The term joining is generally used for welding, brazing,
soldering, and adhesive bonding, which form a permanent
joint between the parts—a joint that cannot easily be separated. The term assembly usually refers to mechanical methods of fastening parts together. Some of these methods allow
for easy disassembly, while others do not. Mechanical assembly is covered in Chapter 32. Brazing, soldering, and
adhesive bonding are discussed in Chapter 31. We begin our
coverage of the joining and assembly processes with welding,
covered in this chapter and the following.
Welding is a materials joining process in which two or
more parts are coalesced at their contacting surfaces by a
suitable application of heat and/or pressure. Many welding
processes are accomplished by heat alone, with no pressure
applied; others by a combination of heat and pressure; and
still others by pressure alone, with no external heat supplied. In some welding processes a filler material is added
to facilitate coalescence. The assemblage of parts that are
joined by welding is called a weldment. Welding is most
commonly associated with metal parts, but the process is
also used for joining plastics. Our discussion of welding will
focus on metals.
Welding is a relatively new process (Historical Note
29.1). Its commercial and technological importance derives
from the following:

Page 694

Chapter 29/Fundamentals of Welding

å Welding provides a permanent joint. The welded parts become a single entity.
å The welded joint can be stronger than the parent materials if a filler metal is used that
has strength properties superior to those of the parents, and if proper welding
techniques are used.
å Welding is usually the most economical way to join components in terms of material
usage and fabrication costs. Alternative mechanical methods of assembly require
more complex shape alterations (e.g., drilling of holes) and addition of fasteners (e.g.,
rivets or bolts). The resulting mechanical assembly is usually heavier than a corresponding weldment.
å Welding is not restricted to the factory environment. It can be accomplished ‘‘in the
field.’’
Although welding has the advantages indicated above, it also has certain limitations and drawbacks (or potential drawbacks):
å Most welding operations are performed manually and are expensive in terms of labor
cost. Many welding operations are considered ‘‘skilled trades,’’ and the labor to
perform these operations may be scarce.
å Most welding processes are inherently dangerous because they involve the use of
high energy.
å Since welding accomplishes a permanent bond between the components, it does not
allow for convenient disassembly. If the product must occasionally be disassembled
(e.g., for repair or maintenance), then welding should not be used as the assembly
method.
å The welded joint can suffer from certain quality defects that are difficult to detect.
The defects can reduce the strength of the joint.

Historical Note 29.1

A

Origins of welding

lthough welding is considered a relatively new
process as practiced today, its origins can be traced to
ancient times. Around 1000 BCE, the Egyptians and others
in the eastern Mediterranean area learned to accomplish
forge welding (Section 30.5.2). It was a natural extension
of hot forging, which they used to make weapons, tools,
and other implements. Forge-welded articles of bronze
have been recovered by archeologists from the pyramids
of Egypt. From these early beginnings through the Middle
Ages, the blacksmith trade developed the art of welding
by hammering to a high level of maturity. Welded
objects of iron and other metals dating from these times
have been found in India and Europe.
It was not until the 1800s that the technological
foundations of modern welding were established. Two
important discoveries were made, both attributed to
English scientist Sir Humphrey Davy: (1) the electric arc,
and (2) acetylene gas.
Around 1801, Davy observed that an electric arc
could be struck between two carbon electrodes.
However, not until the mid-1800s, when the electric

generator was invented, did electrical power become
available in amounts sufficient to sustain arc welding. It
was a Russian, Nikolai Benardos, working out of a
laboratory in France, who was granted a series of patents
for the carbon arc–welding process (one in England in
1885, and another in the United States in 1887). By the
turn of the century, carbon arc welding had become a
popular commercial process for joining metals.
Benardos’ inventions seem to have been limited to
carbon arc welding. In 1892, an American named
Charles Coffin was awarded a U.S. patent for developing
an arc–welding process utilizing a metal electrode. The
unique feature was that the electrode added filler metal
to the weld joint (the carbon arc process does not deposit
filler). The idea of coating the metal electrode (to shield
the welding process from the atmosphere) was
developed later, with enhancements to the metal arc–
welding process being made in England and Sweden
starting around 1900.
Between 1885 and 1900, several forms of resistance
welding were developed by Elihu Thompson. These

E1C29

16:9:58

Page 695

Section 29.1/Overview of Welding Technology
included spot welding and seam welding, two joining
methods widely used today in sheet metalworking.
Although Davy discovered acetylene gas early in the
1800s, oxyfuel gas welding required the subsequent
development of torches for combining acetylene and
oxygen around 1900. During the 1890s, hydrogen and

29.1

695

natural gas were mixed with oxygen for welding, but the
oxyacetylene flame achieved significantly higher
temperatures.
These three welding processes—arc welding, resistance
welding, and oxyfuel gas welding—constitute by far the
majority of welding operations performed today.

OVERVIEW OF WELDING TECHNOLOGY
Welding involves localized coalescence or joining together of two metallic parts at their
faying surfaces. The faying surfaces are the part surfaces in contact or close proximity that
are to be joined. Welding is usually performed on parts made of the same metal, but some
welding operations can be used to join dissimilar metals.

29.1.1 TYPES OF WELDING PROCESSES
Some 50 different types of welding operations have been cataloged by the American
Welding Society. They use various types or combinations of energy to provide the
required power. We can divide the welding processes into two major groups: (1) fusion
welding and (2) solid-state welding.
Fusion Welding Fusion-welding processes use heat to melt the base metals. In many
fusion welding operations, a filler metal is added to the molten pool to facilitate the process
and provide bulk and strength to the welded joint. A fusion-welding operation in which no
filler metal is added is referred to as an autogenous weld. The fusion category includes the
most widely used welding processes, which can be organized into the following general
groups (initials in parentheses are designations of the American Welding Society):
å Arc welding (AW). Arc welding refers to a group of welding processes in which heating
of the metals is accomplished by an electric arc, as shown in Figure 29.1. Some arcwelding operations also apply pressure during the process and most utilize a filler metal.
å Resistance welding (RW). Resistance welding achieves coalescence using heat from
electrical resistance to the flow of a current passing between the faying surfaces of
two parts held together under pressure.
å Oxyfuel gas welding (OFW). These joining processes use an oxyfuel gas, such as a
mixture of oxygen and acetylene, to produce a hot flame for melting the base metal
and filler metal, if one is used.

There are many variations
of the arc-welding
process.

å Other fusion-welding processes. Other welding processes that produce fusion of the
metals joined include electron beam welding and laser beam welding.
Certain arc and oxyfuel processes are also used for cutting metals (Sections 26.3.4
and 26.3.5).
Solid-State Welding Solid-state welding refers to joining processes in which coalescence results from application of pressure alone or a combination of heat and pressure. If
heat is used, the temperature in the process is below the melting point of the metals being
welded. No filler metal is utilized. Representative welding processes in this group
include:
å Diffusion welding (DFW). Two surfaces are held together under pressure at an
elevated temperature and the parts coalesce by solid-state diffusion.
å Friction welding (FRW). Coalescence is achieved by the heat of friction between two
surfaces.
å Ultrasonic welding (USW). Moderate pressure is applied between the two parts and
an oscillating motion at ultrasonic frequencies is used in a direction parallel to the
contacting surfaces. The combination of normal and vibratory forces results in shear
stresses that remove surface films and achieve atomic bonding of the surfaces.
In Chapter 30, we describe the various welding processes in greater detail. The
preceding survey should provide a sufficient framework for our discussion of welding
terminology and principles in the present chapter.

29.1.2 WELDING AS A COMMERCIAL OPERATION
The principal applications of welding are (1) construction, such as buildings and bridges;
(2) piping, pressure vessels, boilers, and storage tanks; (3) shipbuilding; (4) aircraft and
aerospace; and (5) automotive and railroad [1]. Welding is performed in a variety of
locations and in a variety of industries. Owing to its versatility as an assembly technique for
commercial products, many welding operations are performed in factories. However,
several of the traditional processes, such as arc welding and oxyfuel gas welding, use
equipment that can be readily moved, so these operations are not limited to the factory.
They can be performed at construction sites, in shipyards, at customers’ plants, and in
automotive repair shops.
Most welding operations are labor intensive. For example, arc welding is usually
performed by a skilled worker, called a welder, who manually controls the path or placement
of the weld to join individual parts into a larger unit. In factory operations in which arc
welding is manually performed, the welder often works with a second worker, called a fitter.
It is the fitter’s job to arrange the individual components for the welder prior to making the
weld. Welding fixtures and positioners are used for this purpose. Awelding fixture is a device
for clamping and holding the components in fixed position for welding. It is customfabricated for the particular geometry of the weldment and therefore must be economically
justified on the basis of the quantities of assemblies to be produced. Awelding positioner is a
device that holds the parts and also moves the assemblage to the desired position for
welding. This differs from a welding fixture that only holds the parts in a single fixed position.
The desired position is usually one in which the weld path is flat and horizontal.
The Safety Issue Welding is inherently dangerous to human workers. Strict safety
precautions must be practiced by those who perform these operations. The high temperatures of the molten metals in welding are an obvious danger. In gas welding, the fuels

697

(e.g., acetylene) are a fire hazard. Most of the processes use high energy to cause melting of
the part surfaces to be joined. In many welding processes, electrical power is the source of
thermal energy, so there is the hazard of electrical shock to the worker. Certain welding
processes have their own particular perils. In arc welding, for example, ultraviolet radiation
is emitted that is injurious to human vision. A special helmet that includes a dark viewing
window must be worn by the welder. This window filters out the dangerous radiation but is
so dark that it renders the welder virtually blind, except when the arc is struck. Sparks,
spatters of molten metal, smoke, and fumes add to the risks associated with welding
operations. Ventilation facilities must be used to exhaust the dangerous fumes generated by
some of the fluxes and molten metals used in welding. If the operation is performed in an
enclosed area, special ventilation suits or hoods are required.
Automation in Welding Because of the hazards of manual welding, and in efforts to
increase productivity and improve product quality, various forms of mechanization and
automation have been developed. The categories include machine welding, automatic
welding, and robotic welding.
Machine welding can be defined as mechanized welding with equipment that
performs the operation under the continuous supervision of an operator. It is normally
accomplished by a welding head that is moved by mechanical means relative to a stationary
work, or by moving the work relative to a stationary welding head. The human worker must
continually observe and interact with the equipment to control the operation.
If the equipment is capable of performing the operation without control by a human
operator, it is referred to as automatic welding. A human worker is usually present to
oversee the process and detect variations from normal conditions. What distinguishes
automatic welding from machine welding is a weld cycle controller to regulate the arc
movement and workpiece positioning without continuous human attention. Automatic
welding requires a welding fixture and/or positioner to position the work relative to the
welding head. It also requires a higher degree of consistency and accuracy in the component
parts used in the weldment. For these reasons, automatic welding can be justified only for
large quantity production.
In robotic welding, an industrial robot or programmable manipulator is used to
automatically control the movement of the welding head relative to the work (Section
38.4.3). The versatile reach of the robot arm permits the use of relatively simple fixtures, and
the robot’s capacity to be reprogrammed for new part configurations allows this form of
automation to be justified for relatively low production quantities. A typical robotic arcwelding cell consists of two welding fixtures and a human fitter to load and unload parts
while the robot welds. In addition to arc welding, industrial robots are also used in
automobile final assembly plants to perform resistance welding on car bodies (Figure 39.11).

29.2

THE WELD JOINT
Welding produces a solid connection between two pieces, called a weld joint. A weld joint
is the junction of the edges or surfaces of parts that have been joined by welding. This
section covers two classifications related to weld joints: (1) types of joints and (2) the
types of welds used to join the pieces that form the joints.

29.2.1 TYPES OF JOINTS
There are five basic types of joints for bringing two parts together for joining. The five
joint types are not limited to welding; they apply to other joining and fastening

techniques as well. With reference to Figure 29.2, the five joint types can be defined as
follows:
(a) Butt joint. In this joint type, the parts lie in the same plane and are joined at their
edges.
(b) Corner joint. The parts in a corner joint form a right angle and are joined at the corner
of the angle.
(c) Lap joint. This joint consists of two overlapping parts.
(d) Tee joint. In a tee joint, one part is perpendicular to the other in the approximate
shape of the letter ‘‘T.’’
(e) Edge joint. The parts in an edge joint are parallel with at least one of their edges in
common, and the joint is made at the common edge(s).

29.2.2 TYPES OF WELDS
Each of the preceding joints can be made by welding. It is appropriate to distinguish
between the joint type and the way in which it is welded—the weld type. Differences
among weld types are in geometry (joint type) and welding process.
A fillet weld is used to fill in the edges of plates created by corner, lap, and tee
joints, as in Figure 29.3. Filler metal is used to provide a cross section approximately the
shape of a right triangle. It is the most common weld type in arc and oxyfuel welding
because it requires minimum edge preparation—the basic square edges of the parts are
used. Fillet welds can be single or double (i.e., welded on one side or both) and can be
continuous or intermittent (i.e., welded along the entire length of the joint or with
unwelded spaces along the length).
Groove welds usually require that the edges of the parts be shaped into a groove to
facilitate weld penetration. The grooved shapes include square, bevel, V, U, and J, in
FIGURE 29.3 Various

single or double sides, as shown in Figure 29.4. Filler metal is used to fill in the joint,
usually by arc or oxyfuel welding. Preparation of the part edges beyond the basic square
edge, although requiring additional processing, is often done to increase the strength of
the welded joint or where thicker parts are to be welded. Although most closely
associated with a butt joint, groove welds are used on all joint types except lap.
Plug welds and slot welds are used for attaching flat plates, as shown in Figure 29.5,
using one or more holes or slots in the top part and then filling with filler metal to fuse the
two parts together.
Spot welds and seam welds, used for lap joints, are diagrammed in Figure 29.6. A
spot weld is a small fused section between the surfaces of two sheets or plates. Multiple
spot welds are typically required to join the parts. It is most closely associated with
resistance welding. A seam weld is similar to a spot weld except it consists of a more or
less continuously fused section between the two sheets or plates.

FIGURE 29.7 (a) Flange
weld; and (b) surfacing
weld.

Flange welds and surfacing welds are shown in Figure 29.7. A flange weld is made
on the edges of two (or more) parts, usually sheet metal or thin plate, at least one of the
parts being flanged as in Figure 29.7(a). A surfacing weld is not used to join parts, but
rather to deposit filler metal onto the surface of a base part in one or more weld beads.
The weld beads can be made in a series of overlapping parallel passes, thereby covering
large areas of the base part. The purpose is to increase the thickness of the plate or to
provide a protective coating on the surface.

29.3 PHYSICS OF WELDING
Although several coalescing mechanisms are available for welding, fusion is by far the most
common means. In this section, we consider the physical relationships that allow fusion
welding to be performed. We first examine the issue of power density and its importance,
and then we define the heat and power equations that describe a welding process.

29.3.1 POWER DENSITY
To accomplish fusion, a source of high-density heat energy is supplied to the faying surfaces,
and the resulting temperatures are sufficient to cause localized melting of the base metals. If
a filler metal is added, the heat density must be high enough to melt it also. Heat density can
be defined as the power transferred to the work per unit surface area, W/mm2 (Btu/sec-in2).
The time to melt the metal is inversely proportional to the power density. At low power
densities, a significant amount of time is required to cause melting. If power density is too
low, the heat is conducted into the work as rapidly as it is added at the surface, and melting
never occurs. It has been found that the minimum power density required to melt most
metals in welding is about 10 W/mm2 (6 Btu/sec-in2). As heat density increases, melting
time is reduced. If power density is too high—above around 105 W/mm2 (60,000 Btu/secin2)—the localized temperatures vaporize the metal in the affected region. Thus, there is a
practical range of values for power density within which welding can be performed.
Differences among welding processes in this range are (1) the rate at which welding
can be performed and/or (2) the size of the region that can be welded. Table 29.1 provides a
comparison of power densities for the major fusion welding processes. Oxyfuel gas
welding is capable of developing large amounts of heat, but the heat density is relatively
low because it is spread over a large area. Oxyacetylene gas, the hottest of the OFW fuels,
burns at a top temperature of around 3500 C (6300 F). By comparison, arc welding
produces high energy over a smaller area, resulting in local temperatures of 5500 C to
6600 C (10,000 F–12,000 F). For metallurgical reasons, it is desirable to melt the metal
with minimum energy, and high power densities are generally preferable.

where PD ¼ power density, W/mm2 (Btu/sec-in2); P ¼ power entering the surface,
W (Btu/sec); and A ¼ surface area over which the energy is entering, mm2 (in2). The issue
is more complicated than indicated by Eq. (29.1). One complication is that the power
source (e.g., the arc) is moving in many welding processes, which results in preheating
ahead of the operation and postheating behind it. Another complication is that power
density is not uniform throughout the affected surface; it is distributed as a function of
area, as demonstrated by the following example.

Example 29.1
Power Density in
Welding

A heat source transfers 3000 W to the surface of a metal part. The heat impinges the surface
in a circular area, with intensities varying inside the circle. The distribution is as follows: 70%
of the power is transferred within a circle of diameter ¼ 5 mm, and 90% is transferred within
a concentric circle of diameter ¼ 12 mm. What are the power densities in (a) the 5-mm
diameter inner circle and (b) the 12-mm-diameter ring that lies around the inner circle?

Solution: (a) The inner circle has an area A ¼

The power inside this area P ¼ 0.70  3000 ¼ 2100 W.

(b) The area of the ring outside the inner circle is A ¼

The power in this region P ¼ 0.9 (3000)  2100 ¼ 600 W.
600

The power density is therefore PD
93:4
Observation: The power density seems high enough for melting in the inner circle, but
n
probably not sufficient in the ring that lies outside this inner circle.

29.3.2 HEAT BALANCE IN FUSION WELDING
The quantity of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends on (1) the heat to
raise the temperature of the solid metal to its melting point, which depends on the metal’s
volumetric specific heat, (2) the melting point of the metal, and (3) the heat to transform
the metal from solid to liquid phase at the melting point, which depends on the metal’s
heat of fusion. To a reasonable approximation, this quantity of heat can be estimated by

the following equation [5]:
U m ¼ KT 2m

ð29:2Þ

where Um ¼ the unit energy for melting (i.e., the quantity of heat required to melt a unit
volume of metal starting from room temperature), J/mm3 (Btu/in3); Tm ¼ melting point of
the metal on an absolute temperature scale,  K ( R); and K ¼ constant whose value is 3.33 
106 when the Kelvin scale is used (and K ¼ 1.467  105 for the Rankine temperature
scale). Absolute melting temperatures for selected metals are presented in Table 29.2.
Not all of the energy generated at the heat source is used to melt the weld metal.
There are two heat transfer mechanisms at work, both of which reduce the amount of
generated heat that is used by the welding process. The situation is depicted in Figure 29.8.
The first mechanism involves the transfer of heat between the heat source and the surface of
the work. This process has a certain heat transfer factor f1, defined as the ratio of the actual
heat received by the workpiece divided by the total heat generated at the source. The
second mechanism involves the conduction of heat away from the weld area to be
dissipated throughout the work metal, so that only a portion of the heat transferred to
the surface is available for melting. This melting factor f2 is the proportion of heat received
at the work surface that can be used for melting. The combined effect of these two factors is

to reduce the heat energy available for welding as follows:
Hw ¼ f 1f 2H

ð29:3Þ

where Hw ¼ net heat available for welding, J (Btu), f1 ¼ heat transfer factor, f2 ¼ the
melting factor, and H ¼ the total heat generated by the welding process, J (Btu).
The factors f1 and f2 range in value between zero and one. It is appropriate to
separate f1 and f2 in concept, even though they act in concert during the welding process.
The heat transfer factor f1 is determined largely by the welding process and the capacity
to convert the power source (e.g., electrical energy) into usable heat at the work surface.
Arc-welding processes are relatively efficient in this regard, while oxyfuel gas-welding
processes are relatively inefficient.
The melting factor f2 depends on the welding process, but it is also influenced by the
thermal properties of the metal, joint configuration, and work thickness. Metals with high
thermal conductivity, such as aluminum and copper, present a problem in welding because of
the rapid dissipation of heat away from the heat contact area. The problem is exacerbated by
welding heat sources with low energy densities (e.g., oxyfuel welding) because the heat input is
spread over a larger area, thus facilitating conduction into the work. In general, a high power
density combined with a low conductivity work material results in a high melting factor.
We can now write a balance equation between the energy input and the energy
needed for welding:
Hw ¼ U mV

ð29:4Þ

where Hw ¼ net heat energy used by the welding operation, J (Btu); Um ¼ unit energy
required to melt the metal, J/mm3 (Btu/in3); and V ¼ the volume of metal melted, mm3 (in3).
Most welding operations are rate processes; that is, the net heat energy Hw is
delivered at a given rate, and the weld bead is made at a certain travel velocity. This is
characteristic for example of most arc-welding, many oxyfuel gas-welding operations,
and even some resistance welding operations. It is therefore appropriate to express
Eq. (30) as a rate balance equation:
RHw ¼ U m RWV

ð29:5Þ

whereRHw ¼ rateofheatenergydeliveredtotheoperationfor welding,J/s¼ W(Btu/min);and
RWV ¼ volume rate of metal welded, mm3/s (in3/min). In the welding of a continuous bead, the
volume rate of metal welded is the product of weld area Aw and travel velocity v. Substituting
these terms into the above equation, the rate balance equation can now be expressed as
RHw ¼ f 1 f 2 RH ¼ U m Aw v

ð29:6Þ

where f1 and f2 are the heat transfer and melting factors; RH ¼ rate of input energy
generated by the welding power source, W (Btu/min); Aw ¼ weld cross-sectional area,
mm2 (in2); and v ¼ the travel velocity of the welding operation, mm/s (in/min). In
Chapter 30, we examine how the power density in Eq. (29.1) and the input energy rate for
Eq. (29.6) are generated for some of the individual welding processes.

The power source in a particular welding setup generates 3500 W that can be transferred to

operation is 0.5. A continuous fillet weld is to be made with a cross-sectional area ¼ 20 mm2.

29.4 FEATURES OF A FUSION-WELDED JOINT
Most weld joints are fusion welded. As illustrated in the cross-sectional view of Figure 29.9
(a), a typical fusion-weld joint in which filler metal has been added consists of several zones:
(1) fusion zone, (2) weld interface, (3) heat-affected zone, and (4) unaffected base metal
zone.
The fusion zone consists of a mixture of filler metal and base metal that have
completely melted. This zone is characterized by a high degree of homogeneity among
the component metals that have been melted during welding. The mixing of these components is motivated largely by convection in the molten weld pool. Solidification in the fusion
zone has similarities to a casting process. In welding the mold is formed by the unmelted edges
or surfaces of the components being welded. The significant difference between solidification
in casting and in welding is that epitaxial grain growth occurs in welding. The reader may
recall that in casting, the metallic grains are formed from the melt by nucleation of solid
particles at the mold wall, followed by grain growth. In welding, by contrast, the nucleation
stage of solidification is avoided by the mechanism of epitaxial grain growth, in which atoms
from the molten pool solidify on preexisting lattice sites of the adjacent solid base metal.
Consequently, the grain structure in the fusion zone near the heat-affected zone tends to
mimic the crystallographic orientation of the surrounding heat-affected zone. Further into
the fusion zone, a preferred orientation develops in which the grains are roughly perpendicular to the boundaries of the weld interface. The resulting structure in the solidified fusion
zone tends to feature coarse columnar grains, as depicted in Figure 29.9(b). The grain
structure depends on various factors, including welding process, metals being welded (e.g.,
identical metals vs. dissimilar metals welded), whether a filler metal is used, and the feed rate
at which welding is accomplished. A detailed discussion of welding metallurgy is beyond the
scope of this text, and interested readers can consult any of several references [1], [4], [5].
The second zone in the weld joint is the weld interface, a narrow boundary that
separates the fusion zone from the heat-affected zone. The interface consists of a thin band
of base metal that was melted or partially melted (localized melting within the grains) during
the welding process but then immediately solidified before any mixing with the metal in the
fusion zone. Its chemical composition is therefore identical to that of the base metal.
The third zone in the typical fusion weld is the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The
metal in this zone has experienced temperatures that are below its melting point, yet high

enough to cause microstructural changes in the solid metal. The chemical composition in
the heat-affected zone is the same as the base metal, but this region has been heat treated
due to the welding temperatures so that its properties and structure have been altered.
The amount of metallurgical damage in the HAZ depends on factors such as the amount
of heat input and peak temperatures reached, distance from the fusion zone, length of
time the metal has been subjected to the high temperatures, cooling rate, and the metal’s
thermal properties. The effect on mechanical properties in the heat-affected zone is
usually negative, and it is in this region of the weld joint that welding failures often occur.
As the distance from the fusion zone increases, the unaffected base metal zone is
finally reached, in which no metallurgical change has occurred. Nevertheless, the base
metal surrounding the HAZ is likely to be in a state of high residual stress, the result of
shrinkage in the fusion zone.

leg length of 4.5 mm, the heat transfer factor is 0.80,
and the melting factor is 0.58. Determine the rate
of heat generation required at the welding source
to accomplish the weld.
29.20. A spot weld was made using an arc-welding process. In a spot-welding operation, two 1/16-in thick
aluminum plates were joined. The melted metal
formed a nugget that had a diameter of 1/4 in. The
operation required the power to be on for 4 sec.
Assume the final nugget had the same thickness as

height was 3/32 in above the original surface. In
addition, the weld bead penetrated 1/16 in into the

Welding processes divide into two major categories:
(1) fusion welding, in which coalescence is accomplished
by melting the two parts to be joined, in some cases adding
filler metal to the joint; and (2) solid-state welding, in
which heat and/or pressure are used to achieve coalescence,
but no melting of the base metals occurs and no filler metal
is added.
Fusion welding is by far the more important category.
It includes (1) arc welding, (2) resistance welding, (3) oxyfuel gas welding, and (4) other fusion welding processes—
ones that cannot be classified as any of the first three types.
Fusion welding processes are discussed in the first four
sections of this chapter. Section 30.5 covers solid-state
welding. And in the final three sections of the chapter,
we examine issues common to all welding operations:
weld quality, weldability, and design for welding.

30.1 ARC WELDING
Arc welding (AW) is a fusion-welding process in which
coalescence of the metals is achieved by the heat of an
electric arc between an electrode and the work. The same
basic process is also used in arc cutting (Section 26.3.4). A
generic AW process is shown in Figure 30.1. An electric arc is
a discharge of electric current across a gap in a circuit. It is
sustained by the presence of a thermally ionized column of
gas (called a plasma) through which current flows. To initiate
the arc in an AW process, the electrode is brought into
contact with the work and then quickly separated from it
by a short distance. The electric energy from the arc thus
formed produces temperatures of 5500 C (10,000 F) or
higher, sufficiently hot to melt any metal. A pool of molten
metal, consisting of base metal(s) and filler metal (if one is
used) is formed near the tip of the electrode. In most arcwelding processes, filler metal is added during the operation
to increase the volume and strength of the weld joint. As the

electrode is moved along the joint, the molten weld pool solidifies in its wake. Our Video
Clip on welding illustrates the various forms of arc welding described in this section.
VIDEO CLIP
Welding: View the segment on arc welding.

Movement of the electrode relative to the work is accomplished by either a human
welder (manual welding) or by mechanical means (i.e., machine welding, automatic
welding, or robotic welding). One of the troublesome aspects of manual arc welding is
that the quality of the weld joint depends on the skill and work ethic of the human welder.
Productivity is also an issue. It is often measured as arc time (also called arc-on time)—
the proportion of hours worked that arc welding is being accomplished:
Arc time ¼ ðtime arc is onÞ=ðhours workedÞ

ð30:1Þ

This definition can be applied to an individual welder or to a mechanized workstation. For manual welding, arc time is usually around 20%. Frequent rest periods are
needed by the welder to overcome fatigue in manual arc welding, which requires handeye coordination under stressful conditions. Arc time increases to about 50% (more or
less, depending on the operation) for machine, automatic, and robotic welding.

30.1.1 GENERAL TECHNOLOGY OF ARC WELDING
Before describing the individual AW processes, it is instructional to examine some of the
general technical issues that apply to these processes.
Electrodes Electrodes used in AW processes are classified as consumable or nonconsumable. Consumable electrodes provide the source of the filler metal in arc welding.
These electrodes are available in two principal forms: rods (also called sticks) and wire.
Welding rods are typically 225 to 450 mm (9–18 in) long and 9.5 mm (3/8 in) or less in
diameter. The problem with consumable welding rods, at least in production welding
operations, is that they must be changed periodically, reducing arc time of the welder.
Consumable weld wire has the advantage that it can be continuously fed into the weld pool
from spools containing long lengths of wire, thus avoiding the frequent interruptions that
occur when using welding sticks. In both rod and wire forms, the electrode is consumed by
the arc during the welding process and added to the weld joint as filler metal.
Nonconsumable electrodes are made of tungsten (or carbon, rarely), which resists
melting by the arc. Despite its name, a nonconsumable electrode is gradually depleted

E1C30

711

during the welding process (vaporization is the principal mechanism), analogous to the
gradual wearing of a cutting tool in a machining operation. For AW processes that utilize
nonconsumable electrodes, any filler metal used in the operation must be supplied by
means of a separate wire that is fed into the weld pool.
Arc Shielding At the high temperatures in arc welding, the metals being joined are
chemically reactive to oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen in the air. The mechanical properties of
the weld joint can be seriously degraded by these reactions. Thus, some means to shield the arc
from the surrounding air is provided in nearly all AW processes. Arc shielding is accomplished
by covering the electrode tip, arc, and molten weld pool with a blanket of gas or flux, or both,
which inhibit exposure of the weld metal to air.
Common shielding gases include argon and helium, both of which are inert. In the
welding of ferrous metals with certain AW processes, oxygen and carbon dioxide are used,
usually in combination with Ar and/or He, to produce an oxidizing atmosphere or to control
weld shape.
A flux is a substance used to prevent the formation of oxides and other unwanted
contaminants, or to dissolve them and facilitate removal. During welding, the flux melts
and becomes a liquid slag, covering the operation and protecting the molten weld metal.
The slag hardens upon cooling and must be removed later by chipping or brushing. Flux is
usually formulated to serve several additional functions: (1) provide a protective
atmosphere for welding, (2) stabilize the arc, and (3) reduce spattering.
The method of flux application differs for each process. The delivery techniques
include (1) pouring granular flux onto the welding operation, (2) using a stick electrode
coated with flux material in which the coating melts during welding to cover the operation,
and (3) using tubular electrodes in which flux is contained in the core and released as the
electrode is consumed. These techniques are discussed further in our descriptions of the
individual AW processes.
Power Source in Arc Welding Both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC)
are used in arc welding. AC machines are less expensive to purchase and operate, but are
generally restricted to welding of ferrous metals. DC equipment can be used on all metals
with good results and is generally noted for better arc control.
In all arc-welding processes, power to drive the operation is the product of the current
I passing through the arc and the voltage E across it. This power is converted into heat, but
not all of the heat is transferred to the surface of the work. Convection, conduction,
radiation, and spatter account for losses that reduce the amount of usable heat. The effect of
the losses is expressed by the heat transfer factor f1 (Section 29.3). Some representative
values of f1 for several AW processes are given in Table 30.1. Heat transfer factors are

greater for AW processes that use consumable electrodes because most of the heat
consumed in melting the electrode is subsequently transferred to the work as molten
metal. The process with the lowest f1 value in Table 30.1 is gas tungsten arc welding, which
uses a nonconsumable electrode. Melting factor f2 (Section 29.3) further reduces the
available heat for welding. The resulting power balance in arc welding is defined by
RHw ¼ f 1 f 2 IE ¼ U m Aw v

ð30:2Þ

where E ¼ voltage, V; I ¼ current, A; and the other terms were defined in Section 29.3. The
units of RHw are watts (current multiplied by voltage), which equal J/sec. This can be
converted to Btu/sec by recalling that 1 Btu ¼ 1055 J, and thus 1 Btu/sec ¼ 1055 watts.

30.1.2 AW PROCESSES—CONSUMABLE ELECTRODES
A number of important arc-welding processes use consumable electrodes. These are
discussed in this section. Symbols for the welding processes are those used by the
American Welding Society.
Shielded Metal Arc Welding Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) is an AW process
that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a filler metal rod coated with chemicals that
provide flux and shielding. The process is illustrated in Figures 30.2 and 30.3. The welding
stick (SMAWis sometimes called stick welding) is typically 225 to 450 mm (9–18 in) long and
2.5 to 9.5 mm (3/32–3/8 in) in diameter. The filler metal used in the rod must be compatible
with the metal to be welded, the composition usually being very close to that of the base
metal. The coating consists of powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed
with oxides, carbonates, and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal
powders are also sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of filler metal
and to add alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a
protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation. It also helps to stabilize the arc
and regulate the rate at which the electrode melts.
During operation the bare metal end of the welding stick (opposite the welding tip)
is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected to the power source. The holder has an
insulated handle so that it can be held and manipulated by a human welder. Currents
typically used in SMAW range between 30 and 300 A at voltages from 15 to 45 V.
Selection of the proper power parameters depends on the metals being welded, electrode
type and length, and depth of weld penetration required. Power supply, connecting
cables, and electrode holder can be bought for a few thousand dollars.

Brothers, Troy, Ohio.)

Shielded metal arc welding is usually performed manually. Common applications
include construction, pipelines, machinery structures, shipbuilding, job shop fabrication,
and repair work. It is preferred over oxyfuel welding for thicker sections—above 5 mm
(3/16 in)—because of its higher power density. The equipment is portable and low cost,
making SMAW highly versatile and probably the most widely used of the AW processes.
Base metals include steels, stainless steels, cast irons, and certain nonferrous alloys. It is
not used or seldom used for aluminum and its alloys, copper alloys, and titanium.
A disadvantage of shielded metal arc welding as a production operation is the use
of the consumable electrode stick. As the sticks are used up, they must periodically be
changed. This reduces the arc time with this welding process. Another limitation is the
current level that can be used. Because the electrode length varies during the operation
and this length affects the resistance heating of the electrode, current levels must be
maintained within a safe range or the coating will overheat and melt prematurely when
starting a new welding stick. Some of the other AW processes overcome the limitations of
welding stick length in SMAW by using a continuously fed wire electrode.

electrode is a consumable bare metal wire, and shielding is accomplished by flooding the arc

diameters ranging from 0.8 to 6.5 mm (1/32–1/4 in) are used in GMAW, the size depending
on the thickness of the parts being joined and the desired deposition rate. Gases used for
shielding include inert gases such as argon and helium, and active gases such as carbon
dioxide. Selection of gases (and mixtures of gases) depends on the metal being welded, as
well as other factors. Inert gases are used for welding aluminum alloys and stainless steels,

while CO2 is commonly used for welding low and medium carbon steels. The combination
of bare electrode wire and shielding gases eliminates the slag covering on the weld bead and
thus precludes the need for manual grinding and cleaning of the slag. The GMAW process is
therefore ideal for making multiple welding passes on the same joint.
The various metals on which GMAW is used and the variations of the process itself
have given rise to a variety of names for gas metal arc welding. When the process was first
introduced in the late 1940s, it was applied to the welding of aluminum using inert gas
(argon) for arc shielding. The name applied to this process was MIG welding (for metal
inert gas welding). When the same welding process was applied to steel, it was found that
inert gases were expensive and CO2 was used as a substitute. Hence the term CO2 welding
was applied. Refinements in GMAW for steel welding have led to the use of gas mixtures,
including CO2 and argon, and even oxygen and argon.
GMAW is widely used in fabrication operations in factories for welding a variety of
ferrous and nonferrous metals. Because it uses continuous weld wire rather than welding
sticks, it has a significant advantage over SMAW in terms of arc time when performed
manually. For the same reason, it also lends itself to automation of arc welding. The electrode
stubs remaining after stick welding also wastes filler metal, so the utilization of electrode
material is higher with GMAW. Other features of GMAW include elimination of slag
removal (since no flux is used), higher deposition rates than SMAW, and good versatility.
Flux-Cored Arc Welding This arc-welding process was developed in the early 1950s as
an adaptation of shielded metal arc welding to overcome the limitations imposed by the use
of stick electrodes. Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) is an arc-welding process in which the
electrode is a continuous consumable tubing that contains flux and other ingredients in its
core. Other ingredients may include deoxidizers and alloying elements. The tubular fluxcored ‘‘wire’’ is flexible and can therefore be supplied in the form of coils to be continuously
fed through the arc-welding gun. There are two versions of FCAW: (1) self-shielded and
(2) gas shielded. In the first version of FCAW to be developed, arc shielding was provided
by a flux core, thus leading to the name self-shielded flux-cored arc welding. The core in
this form of FCAW includes not only fluxes but also ingredients that generate shielding
gases for protecting the arc. The second version of FCAW, developed primarily for welding
steels, obtains arc shielding from externally supplied gases, similar to gas metal arc
welding. This version is called gas-shielded flux-cored arc welding. Because it utilizes an
electrode containing its own flux together with separate shielding gases, it might be
considered a hybrid of SMAW and GMAW. Shielding gases typically employed are
carbon dioxide for mild steels or mixtures of argon and carbon dioxide for stainless
steels. Figure 30.6 illustrates the FCAW process, with the gas (optional) distinguishing
between the two types.

FCAW has advantages similar to GMAW, due to continuous feeding of the electrode.
It is used primarily for welding steels and stainless steels over a wide stock thickness range.
It is noted for its capability to produce very-high-quality weld joints that are smooth and
uniform.
Electrogas Welding Electrogas welding (EGW) is an AW process that uses a continuous
consumable electrode (either flux-cored wire or bare wire with externally supplied shielding
gases) and molding shoes to contain the molten metal. The process is primarily applied to
vertical butt welding, as pictured in Figure 30.7. When the flux-cored electrode wire is
employed, no external gases are supplied, and the process can be considered a special
application of self-shielded FCAW. When a bare electrode wire is used with shielding gases
from an external source, it is considered a special case of GMAW. The molding shoes are water
cooled to prevent their being added to the weld pool. Together with the edges of the parts being
welded, the shoes form a container, almost like a mold cavity, into which the molten metal from
the electrode and base parts is gradually added. The process is performed automatically, with a
moving weld head traveling vertically upward to fill the cavity in a single pass.
Principal applications of electrogas welding are steels (low- and medium-carbon,
low-alloy, and certain stainless steels) in the construction of large storage tanks and in
shipbuilding. Stock thicknesses from 12 to 75 mm (0.5–3.0 in) are within the capacity of
EGW. In addition to butt welding, it can also be used for fillet and groove welds, always in
a vertical orientation. Specially designed molding shoes must sometimes be fabricated for
the joint shapes involved.
Submerged Arc Welding This process, developed during the 1930s, was one of the first
AW processes to be automated. Submerged arc welding (SAW) is an arc-welding process
that uses a continuous, consumable bare wire electrode, and arc shielding is provided by a
cover of granular flux. The electrode wire is fed automatically from a coil into the arc. The
flux is introduced into the joint slightly ahead of the weld arc by gravity from a hopper, as
shown in Figure 30.8. The blanket of granular flux completely submerges the welding
operation, preventing sparks, spatter, and radiation that are so hazardous in other AW
processes. Thus, the welding operator in SAW need not wear the somewhat cumbersome
face shield required in the other operations (safety glasses and protective gloves, of course,
are required). The portion of the flux closest to the arc is melted, mixing with the molten
weld metal to remove impurities and then solidifying on top of the weld joint to form a glasslike slag. The slag and unfused flux granules on top provide good protection from the
atmosphere and good thermal insulation for the weld area, resulting in relatively slow
cooling and a high-quality weld joint, noted for toughness and ductility. As depicted in our

sketch, the unfused flux remaining after welding can be recovered and reused. The solid
slag covering the weld must be chipped away, usually by manual means.
Submerged arc welding is widely used in steel fabrication for structural shapes (e.g.,
welded I-beams); longitudinal and circumferential seams for large diameter pipes, tanks,
and pressure vessels; and welded components for heavy machinery. In these kinds of
applications, steel plates of 25-mm (1.0-in) thickness and heavier are routinely welded by
this process. Low-carbon, low-alloy, and stainless steels can be readily welded by SAW;
but not high-carbon steels, tool steels, and most nonferrous metals. Because of the gravity
feed of the granular flux, the parts must always be in a horizontal orientation, and a
backup plate is often required beneath the joint during the welding operation.

30.1.3 AW PROCESSES—NONCONSUMABLE ELECTRODES
The AW processes discussed above use consumable electrodes. Gas tungsten arc welding,
plasma arc welding, and several other processes use nonconsumable electrodes.
Gas Tungsten Arc Welding Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is an AW process that
uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode and an inert gas for arc shielding. The term TIG
welding (tungsten inert gas welding) is often applied to this process (in Europe, WIG
welding is the term—the chemical symbol for tungsten is W, for Wolfram). GTAW can be
implemented with or without a filler metal. Figure 30.9 illustrates the latter case. When a
filler metal is used, it is added to the weld pool from a separate rod or wire, being melted by
the heat of the arc rather than transferred across the arc as in the consumable electrode AW
processes. Tungsten is a good electrode material due to its high melting point of 3410 C
(6170 F). Typical shielding gases include argon, helium, or a mixture of these gas elements.
GTAW is applicable to nearly all metals in a wide range of stock thicknesses. It can also
be used for joining various combinations of dissimilar metals. Its most common applications

are for aluminum and stainless steel. Cast irons, wrought irons, and of course tungsten are
difficult to weld by GTAW. In steel welding applications, GTAW is generally slower and
more costly than the consumable electrode AW processes, except when thin sections are
involved and very-high-quality welds are required. When thin sheets are TIG welded to
close tolerances, filler metal is usually not added. The process can be performed manually or
by machine and automated methods for all joint types. Advantages of GTAW in the
applications to which it is suited include high-quality welds, no weld spatter because no filler
metal is transferred across the arc, and little or no postweld cleaning because no flux is used.
Plasma Arc Welding Plasma arc welding (PAW) is a special form of gas tungsten arc
welding in which a constricted plasma arc is directed at the weld area. In PAW, a tungsten
electrode is contained in a specially designed nozzle that focuses a high-velocity stream of
inert gas (e.g., argon or argon–hydrogen mixtures) into the region of the arc to form a highvelocity, intensely hot plasma arc stream, as in Figure 30.10. Argon, argon–hydrogen, and
helium are also used as the arc-shielding gases.
Temperatures in plasma arc welding reach 17,000 C (30,000 F) or greater, hot enough
to melt any known metal. The reason why temperatures are so high in PAW (significantly
higher than those in GTAW) derives from the constriction of the arc. Although the typical
power levels used in PAWare below those used in GTAW, the power is highly concentrated to
produce a plasma jet of small diameter and very high power density.
Plasma arc welding was introduced around 1960 but was slow to catch on. In recent
years its use is increasing as a substitute for GTAW in applications such as automobile
subassemblies, metal cabinets, door and window frames, and home appliances. Owing to
the special features of PAW, its advantages in these applications include good arc stability,
better penetration control than most other AW processes, high travel speeds, and excellent
weld quality. The process can be used to weld almost any metal, including tungsten.
Difficult-to-weld metals with PAW include bronze, cast irons, lead, and magnesium. Other
limitations include high equipment cost and larger torch size than other AW operations,
which tends to restrict access in some joint configurations.
Other Arc-Welding and Related Processes The preceding AW processes are the most
important commercially. There are several others that should be mentioned, which are
special cases or variations of the principal AW processes.
Carbon arc welding (CAW) is an arc-welding process in which a nonconsumable
carbon (graphite) electrode is used. It has historical importance because it was the first
arc-welding process to be developed, but its commercial importance today is practically
nil. The carbon arc process is used as a heat source for brazing and for repairing iron
castings. It can also be used in some applications for depositing wear-resistant materials
on surfaces. Graphite electrodes for welding have been largely superseded by tungsten
(in GTAW and PAW).

from base to establish arc and create a molten pool; (3) stud is plunged into molten pool; and (4) ceramic ferrule is

Stud welding (SW) is a specialized AW process for joining studs or similar components to base parts. A typical SW operation is illustrated in Figure 30.11, in which shielding
is obtained by the use of a ceramic ferrule. To begin with, the stud is chucked in a special
weld gun that automatically controls the timing and power parameters of the steps shown in
the sequence. The worker must only position the gun at the proper location against the base
workpart to which the stud will be attached and pull the trigger. SW applications include
threaded fasteners for attaching handles to cookware, heat radiation fins on machinery, and
similar assembly situations. In high-production operations, stud welding usually has
advantages over rivets, manually arc-welded attachments, and drilled and tapped holes.

30.2

RESISTANCE WELDING
Resistance welding (RW) is a group of fusion-welding processes that uses a combination of
heat and pressure to accomplish coalescence, the heat being generated by electrical
resistance to current flow at the junction to be welded. The principal components in
resistance welding are shown in Figure 30.12 for a resistance spot-welding operation, the
most widely used process in the group. The components include workparts to be welded

Chapter 30/Welding Processes

(usually sheet metal parts), two opposing electrodes, a means of applying pressure to
squeeze the parts between the electrodes, and an AC power supply from which a controlled
current can be applied. The operation results in a fused zone between the two parts, called a
weld nugget in spot welding.
By comparison to arc welding, resistance welding uses no shielding gases, flux, or
filler metal; and the electrodes that conduct electrical power to the process are nonconsumable. RW is classified as fusion welding because the applied heat almost always
causes melting of the faying surfaces. However, there are exceptions. Some welding
operations based on resistance heating use temperatures below the melting points of the
base metals, so fusion does not occur.

30.2.1 POWER SOURCE IN RESISTANCE WELDING
The heat energy supplied to the welding operation depends on current flow, resistance of
the circuit, and length of time the current is applied. This can be expressed by the equation
H ¼ I 2 Rt

ð30:3Þ

where H ¼ heat generated, J (to convert to Btu divide by 1055); I ¼ current, A; R ¼
electrical resistance, V; and t ¼ time, s.
The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000 to 20,000 A,
typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below 10 V). The duration t of the current
is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to 0.4 s in a typical spot-welding operation.
The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term
in Eq. (30.3) amplifies the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low (around
0.0001 V). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of the electrodes,
(2) resistances of the workparts, (3) contact resistances between electrodes and workparts,
and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat is generated in all of these
regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for the faying surfaces to be the largest
resistance in the sum, since this is the desired location of the weld. The resistance of the
electrodes is minimized by using metals with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the
electrodes are often water cooled to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The workpart
resistances are a function of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The
contact resistances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas
(i.e., size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness of the
work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying surfaces
depends on surface finish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint, oil, dirt, or other
contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.

Example 30.2
Resistance
Welding

A resistance spot-welding operation is performed on two pieces of 1.5-mm-thick sheet
steel using 12,000 A for a 0.20 s duration. The electrodes are 6 mm in diameter at the
contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be 0.0001 V, and the resulting weld nugget
is 6 mm in diameter and 2.5 mm thick. The unit melting energy for the metal Um ¼ 12.0 J/
mm3. What portion of the heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what
portion was dissipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?
Solution:

The heat generated in the operation is given by Eq. (30.3) as.
H ¼ ð12; 000Þ2 ð0:0001Þð0:2Þ ¼ 2880 J

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is Hw ¼ 70.7(12.0) ¼ 848 J. The remaining
heat, 2880  848 ¼ 2032 J (70.6% of the total), is lost into the work metal, electrodes, and
surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents the combined effect of the heat transfer
factor f1 and the melting factor f2 (Section 29.3).
n
Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal
functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and the
workparts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and (2) press the
faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper welding temperature
has been reached.
General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no filler metal is required,
(2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and automation,
(4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and (5) good
repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high—usually
much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that can be
welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.

30.2.2 RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES
The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam, and
projection welding. These processes are illustrated in our Video Clip on welding.
VIDEO CLIP
Welding: View the segment titled Resistance Welding.
Resistance Spot Welding Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant process in
this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances, metal
furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a typical car
body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual production of
automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of units, the economic
importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.
Resistance spot welding (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying
surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process is
used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness 3 mm (0.125 in) or less, using a series of spot
welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and shape of the
weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common electrode shape being
round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The resulting weld nugget is
typically 5 to 10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) in diameter, with a heat-affected zone extending slightly
beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld is made properly, its strength will be
comparable to that of the surrounding metal. The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted
in Figure 30.13.
Materials used for RSWelectrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based alloys
and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combinations. The
second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufacturing processes,
the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used. Whenever practical, the
electrodes are designed with internal passageways for water cooling.
Because of its widespread industrial use, various machines and methods are available
to perform spot-welding operations. The equipment includes rocker-arm and press-type
spot-welding machines, and portable spot-welding guns. Rocker-arm spot welders, shown
in Figure 30.14, have a stationary lower electrode and a movable upper electrode that can
be raised and lowered for loading and unloading the work. The upper electrode is mounted

on a rocker arm (hence the name) whose movement is controlled by a foot pedal operated
by the worker. Modern machines can be programmed to control force and current during
the weld cycle.
Press-type spot welders are intended for larger work. The upper electrode has a
straight-line motion provided by a vertical press that is pneumatically or hydraulically
powered. The press action permits larger forces to be applied, and the controls usually
permit programming of complex weld cycles.
The previous two machine types are both stationary spot welders, in which the work
is brought to the machine. For large, heavy work it is difficult to move and position the
part into stationary machines. For these cases, portable spot-welding guns are available in

various sizes and configurations. These devices consist of two opposing electrodes
contained in a pincer mechanism. Each unit is lightweight so that it can be held and
manipulated by a human worker or an industrial robot. The gun is connected to its own
power and control source by means of flexible electrical cables and air hoses. Water
cooling for the electrodes, if needed, can also be provided through a water hose. Portable
spot-welding guns are widely used in automobile final assembly plants to spot weld car
bodies. Some of these guns are operated by people, but industrial robots have become the
preferred technology, illustrated in Figure 38.16.
Resistance Seam Welding In resistance seam welding (RSEW), the stick-shaped
electrodes in spot welding are replaced by rotating wheels, as shown in Figure 30.15,
and a series of overlapping spot welds are made along the lap joint. The process is capable of
producing air-tight joints, and its industrial applications include the production of gasoline
tanks, automobile mufflers, and various other fabricated sheet metal containers. Technically, RSEW is the same as spot welding, except that the wheel electrodes introduce certain
complexities. Since the operation is usually carried out continuously, rather than discretely,
the seams should be along a straight or uniformly curved line. Sharp corners and similar
discontinuities are difficult to deal with. Also, warping of the parts becomes more of a factor
in resistance seam welding, and fixtures are required to hold the work in position and
minimize distortion.
The spacing between the weld nuggets in resistance seam welding depends on the
motion of the electrode wheels relative to the application of the weld current. In the usual
method of operation, called continuous motion welding, the wheel is rotated continuously at a constant velocity, and current is turned on at timing intervals consistent with the
desired spacing between spot welds along the seam. Frequency of the current discharges
is normally set so that overlapping weld spots are produced. But if the frequency is
reduced sufficiently, then there will be spaces between the weld spots, and this method is
termed roll spot welding. In another variation, the welding current remains on at a
constant level (rather than being pulsed) so that a truly continuous welding seam is
produced. These variations are depicted in Figure 30.16.
An alternative to continuous motion welding is intermittent motion welding, in
which the electrode wheel is periodically stopped to make the spot weld. The amount of
wheel rotation between stops determines the distance between weld spots along the
seam, yielding patterns similar to (a) and (b) in Figure 30.16.
Seam-welding machines are similar to press-type spot welders except that electrode
wheels are used rather than the usual stick-shaped electrodes. Cooling of the work and
wheels is often necessary in RSEW, and this is accomplished by directing water at the top
and underside of the workpart surfaces near the electrode wheels.

Resistance Projection Welding Resistance projection welding (RPW) is an RW
process in which coalescence occurs at one or more relatively small contact points on
the parts. These contact points are determined by the design of the parts to be joined, and
may consist of projections, embossments, or localized intersections of the parts. A typical
case in which two sheet-metal parts are welded together is described in Figure 30.17. The
part on top has been fabricated with two embossed points to contact the other part at the
start of the process. It might be argued that the embossing operation increases the cost of
the part, but this increase may be more than offset by savings in welding cost.
There are variations of resistance projection welding, two of which are shown in
Figure 30.18. In one variation, fasteners with machined or formed projections can be
permanently joined to sheet or plate by RPW, facilitating subsequent assembly operations.
Another variation, called cross-wire welding, is used to fabricate welded wire products
such as wire fence, shopping carts, and stove grills. In this process, the contacting surfaces of
the round wires serve as the projections to localize the resistance heat for welding.
Other Resistance-Welding Operations In addition to the principal RW processes
described above, several additional processes in this group should be identified: flash,
upset, percussion, and high-frequency resistance welding.
In flash welding (FW), normally used for butt joints, the two surfaces to be joined are
brought into contact or near contact and electric current is applied to heat the surfaces to
the melting point, after which the surfaces are forced together to form the weld. The two
steps are outlined in Figure 30.19. In addition to resistance heating, some arcing occurs
(called flashing, hence the name of the welding process), depending on the extent of

welding (RPW): (1) at start
of operation, contact between parts is at projections; and (2) when current
is applied, weld nuggets
similar to those in spot
welding are formed at the

contact between the faying surfaces, so flash welding is sometimes classified in the arcwelding group. Current is usually stopped during upsetting. Some metal, as well as
contaminants on the surfaces, is squeezed out of the joint and must be subsequently
machined to provide a joint of uniform size.
Applications of flash welding include butt welding of steel strips in rolling-mill
operations, joining ends of wire in wire drawing, and welding of tubular parts. The ends to
be joined must have the same cross sections. For these kinds of high-production
applications, flash welding is fast and economical, but the equipment is expensive.
Upset welding (UW) is similar to flash welding except that in UW the faying
surfaces are pressed together during heating and upsetting. In flash welding, the heating
and pressing steps are separated during the cycle. Heating in UW is accomplished entirely
by electrical resistance at the contacting surfaces; no arcing occurs. When the faying
surfaces have been heated to a suitable temperature below the melting point, the force
pressing the parts together is increased to cause upsetting and coalescence in the contact
region. Thus, upset welding is not a fusion-welding process in the same sense as the other
welding processes we have discussed. Applications of UW are similar to those of flash
welding: joining ends of wire, pipes, tubes, and so on.
Percussion welding (PEW) is also similar to flash welding, except that the duration of
the weld cycle is extremely short, typically lasting only 1 to 10 ms. Fast heating is
accomplished by rapid discharge of electrical energy between the two surfaces to be
joined, followed immediately by percussion of one part against the other to form the weld.
The heating is very localized, making this process attractive for electronic applications in
which the dimensions are very small and nearby components may be sensitive to heat.
High-frequency resistance welding (HFRW) is a resistance-welding process in
which a high-frequency alternating current is used for heating, followed by the rapid
application of an upsetting force to cause coalescence, as in Figure 30.20(a). The
frequencies are 10 to 500 kHz, and the electrodes make contact with the work in the
immediate vicinity of the weld joint. In a variation of the process, called high-frequency

induction welding (HFIW), the heating current is induced in the parts by a highfrequency induction coil, as in Figure 30.20(b). The coil does not make physical contact
with the work. The principal applications of both HFRW and HFIW are continuous butt
welding of the longitudinal seams of metal pipes and tubes.

30.3 OXYFUEL GAS WELDING
Oxyfuel gas welding (OFW) is the term used to describe the group of FW operations that
burn various fuels mixed with oxygen to perform welding. The OFW processes employ
several types of gases, which is the primary distinction among the members of this group.
Oxyfuel gas is also commonly used in cutting torches to cut and separate metal plates and
other parts (Section 26.3.5). The most important OFW process is oxyacetylene welding.

30.3.1 OXYACETYLENE WELDING
Oxyacetylene welding (OAW) is a fusion-welding process performed by a high-temperature flame from combustion of acetylene and oxygen. The flame is directed by a welding
torch. A filler metal is sometimes added, and pressure is occasionally applied in OAW
between the contacting part surfaces. A typical OAW operation is sketched in Figure 30.21.

When filler metal is used, it is typically in the form of a rod with diameters ranging from 1.6
to 9.5 mm (1/16–3/8 in). Composition of the filler must be similar to that of the base metals.
The filler is often coated with a flux that helps to clean the surfaces and prevent oxidation,
thus creating a better weld joint.
Acetylene (C2H2) is the most popular fuel among the OFW group because it is
capable of higher temperatures than any of the others—up to 3480 C (6300 F). The flame
in OAW is produced by the chemical reaction of acetylene and oxygen in two stages. The
first stage is defined by the reaction
C2 H2 þ O2 ! 2CO þ H2 þ heat

ð30:4aÞ

the products of which are both combustible, which leads to the second-stage reaction
2CO þ H2 þ 1:5O2 ! 2CO2 þ H2 O þ heat

ð30:4bÞ

The two stages of combustion are visible in the oxyacetylene flame emitted from
the torch. When the mixture of acetylene and oxygen is in the ratio 1:1, as described in
Eq. (30.4), the resulting neutral flame is shown in Figure 30.22. The first-stage reaction is
seen as the inner cone of the flame (which is bright white), while the second-stage
reaction is exhibited by the outer envelope (which is nearly colorless but with tinges
ranging from blue to orange). The maximum temperature of the flame is reached at the
tip of the inner cone; the second-stage temperatures are somewhat below those of the
inner cone. During welding, the outer envelope spreads out and covers the work surfaces
being joined, thus shielding them from the surrounding atmosphere.
Total heat liberated during the two stages of combustion is 55  106 J/m3 (1470 Btu/
3
ft ) of acetylene. However, because of the temperature distribution in the flame, the way
in which the flame spreads over the work surface, and losses to the air, power densities
and heat transfer factors in oxyacetylene welding are relatively low; f1 ¼ 0.10 to 0.30.

Heat Generation

Welding

An oxyacetylene torch supplies 0.3 m3 of acetylene per hour and an equal volume rate of
oxygen for an OAW operation on 4.5-mm-thick steel. Heat generated by combustion is
transferred to the work surface with a heat transfer factor f1 ¼ 0.20. If 75% of the heat
from the flame is concentrated in a circular area on the work surface that is 9.0 mm in
diameter, find (a) rate of heat liberated during combustion, (b) rate of heat transferred to
the work surface, and (c) average power density in the circular area.

The combination of acetylene and oxygen is highly flammable, and the environment in which OAW is performed is therefore hazardous. Some of the dangers relate
specifically to the acetylene. Pure C2H2 is a colorless, odorless gas. For safety reasons,
commercial acetylene is processed to have a characteristic garlic odor. One of the
physical limitations of the gas is that it is unstable at pressures much above 1 atm
(0.1 MPa or 15 lb/in2). Accordingly, acetylene storage cylinders are packed with a porous
filler material (such as asbestos, balsa wood, and other materials) saturated with acetone
(CH3COCH3). Acetylene dissolves in liquid acetone; in fact, acetone dissolves about
25 times its own volume of acetylene, thus providing a relatively safe means of storing this
welding gas. The welder wears eye and skin protection (goggles, gloves, and protective
clothing) as an additional safety precaution, and different screw threads are standard on
the acetylene and oxygen cylinders and hoses to avoid accidental connection of the wrong
gases. Proper maintenance of the equipment is imperative. OAW equipment is relatively
inexpensive and portable. It is therefore an economical, versatile process that is well
suited to low-quantity production and repair jobs. It is rarely used to weld sheet and plate
stock thicker than 6.4 mm (1/4 in) because of the advantages of arc welding in such
applications. Although OAW can be mechanized, it is usually performed manually and is
hence dependent on the skill of the welder to produce a high-quality weld joint.

30.3.2 ALTERNATIVE GASES FOR OXYFUEL WELDING
Several members of the OFW group are based on gases other than acetylene. Most of the
alternative fuels are listed in Table 30.2, together with their burning temperatures and
combustion heats. For comparison, acetylene is included in the list. Although oxyacetylene is the most common OFW fuel, each of the other gases can be used in certain
applications—typically limited to welding of sheet metal and metals with low melting

An application of pressure gas welding: (a) heating of the two parts, and (b) applying pressure to form

temperatures, and brazing (Section 31.1). In addition, some users prefer these alternative
gases for safety reasons.
The fuel that competes most closely with acetylene in burning temperature and
heating value is methylacetylene-propadiene. It is a fuel developed by the Dow Chemical
Company sold under the trade name MAPP (we are grateful to Dow for the abbreviation).
MAPP (C3H4) has heating characteristics similar to acetylene and can be stored under
pressure as a liquid, thus avoiding the special storage problems associated with C2H2.
When hydrogen is burned with oxygen as the fuel, the process is called oxyhydrogen welding (OHW). As shown in Table 30.2, the welding temperature in OHW is
below that possible in oxyacetylene welding. In addition, the color of the flame is not
affected by differences in the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, and therefore it is more
difficult for the welder to adjust the torch.
Other fuels used in OFW include propane and natural gas. Propane (C3H8) is more
closely associated with brazing, soldering, and cutting operations than with welding. Natural
gas consists mostly of ethane (C2H6) and methane (CH4). When mixed with oxygen it
achieves a high temperature flame and is becoming more common in small welding shops.
Pressure Gas Welding This is a special OFW process, distinguished by type of
application rather than fuel gas. Pressure gas welding (PGW) is a fusion-welding process
in which coalescence is obtained over the entire contact surfaces of the two parts by
heating them with an appropriate fuel mixture (usually oxyacetylene gas) and then
applying pressure to bond the surfaces. A typical application is illustrated in Figure 30.23.
Parts are heated until melting begins on the surfaces. The heating torch is then
withdrawn, and the parts are pressed together and held at high pressure while solidification occurs. No filler metal is used in PGW.

30.4

OTHER FUSION-WELDING PROCESSES
Some fusion-welding processes cannot be classified as arc, resistance, or oxyfuel welding.
Each of these other processes uses a unique technology to develop heat for melting; and
typically, the applications are unique.
Electron-Beam Welding Electron-beam welding (EBW) is a fusion-welding process in
which the heat for welding is produced by a highly focused, high-intensity stream of

E1C30

16:12:31

Page 730

Chapter 30/Welding Processes

electrons impinging against the work surface. The equipment is similar to that used for
electron-beam machining (Section 26.3.2). The electron beam gun operates at high
voltage to accelerate the electrons (e.g., 10–150 kV typical), and beam currents are low
(measured in milliamps). The power in EBW is not exceptional, but power density is.
High power density is achieved by focusing the electron beam on a very small area of the
work surface, so that the power density PD is based on
PD ¼

f 1 EI
A

ð30:5Þ

where PD ¼ power density, W/mm2 (W/in2, which can be converted to Btu/sec-in2 by
dividing by 1055.); f1 ¼ heat transfer factor (typical values for EBW range from 0.8–0.95
[9]); E ¼ accelerating voltage, V; I ¼ beam current, A; and A ¼ the work surface area on
which the electron beam is focused, mm2 (in2). Typical weld areas for EBW range from
13  103 to 2000  103 mm2 (20  106 to 3000  106 in2).
The process had its beginnings in the 1950s in the atomic power field. When first
developed, welding had to be carried out in a vacuum chamber to minimize the
disruption of the electron beam by air molecules. This requirement was, and still is, a
serious inconvenience in production, due to the time required to evacuate the chamber
prior to welding. The pump-down time, as it is called, can take as long as an hour,
depending on the size of the chamber and the level of vacuum required. Today, EBW
technology has progressed to where some operations are performed without a vacuum.
Three categories can be distinguished: (1) high-vacuum welding (EBW-HV), in which
welding is carried out in the same vacuum as beam generation; (2) medium-vacuum
welding (EBW-MV), in which the operation is performed in a separate chamber where
only a partial vacuum is achieved; and (3) nonvacuum welding (EBW-NV), in which
welding is accomplished at or near atmospheric pressure. The pump-down time during
workpart loading and unloading is reduced in medium-vacuum EBW and minimized in
nonvacuum EBW, but there is a price paid for this advantage. In the latter two operations,
the equipment must include one or more vacuum dividers (very small orifices that
impede air flow but permit passage of the electron beam) to separate the beam generator
(which requires a high vacuum) from the work chamber. Also, in nonvacuum EBW, the
work must be located close to the orifice of the electron beam gun, approximately 13 mm
(0.5 in) or less. Finally, the lower vacuum processes cannot achieve the high weld qualities
and depth-to-width ratios accomplished by EBW-HV.
Any metals that can be arc welded can be welded by EBW, as well as certain
refractory and difficult-to-weld metals that are not suited to AW. Work sizes range from
thin foil to thick plate. EBW is applied mostly in the automotive, aerospace, and nuclear
industries. In the automotive industry, EBW assembly includes aluminum manifolds,
steel torque converters, catalytic converters, and transmission components. In these and
other applications, electron-beam welding is noted for high-quality welds with deep and/
or narrow profiles, limited heat-affected zone, and low thermal distortion. Welding
speeds are high compared to other continuous welding operations. No filler metal is
used, and no flux or shielding gases are needed. Disadvantages of EBW include high
equipment cost, need for precise joint preparation and alignment, and the limitations
associated with performing the process in a vacuum, as we have already discussed. In
addition, there are safety concerns because EBW generates X-rays from which humans
must be shielded.
Laser-Beam Welding Laser-beam welding (LBW) is a fusion-welding process in which
coalescence is achieved by the energy of a highly concentrated, coherent light beam
focused on the joint to be welded. The term laser is an acronym for light amplification
by stimulated emission of radiation. This same technology is used for laser-beam
machining (Section 26.3.3). LBW is normally performed with shielding gases (e.g.,

helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide) to prevent oxidation. Filler metal is not
usually added.
LBW produces welds of high quality, deep penetration, and narrow heat-affected
zone. These features are similar to those achieved in electron-beam welding, and the two
processes are often compared. There are several advantages of LBW over EBW: no
vacuum chamber is required, no X-rays are emitted, and laser beams can be focused and
directed by optical lenses and mirrors. On the other hand, LBW does not possess the
capability for the deep welds and high depth-to-width ratios of EBW. Maximum depth in
laser welding is about 19 mm (0.75 in), whereas EBW can be used for weld depths of
50 mm (2 in) or more; and the depth-to-width ratios in LBW are typically limited to
around 5:1. Because of the highly concentrated energy in the small area of the laser beam,
the process is often used to join small parts.
Electroslag Welding This process uses the same basic equipment as in some arc-welding
operations, and it utilizes an arc to initiate welding. However, it is not an AW process
because an arc is not used during welding. Electroslag welding (ESW) is a fusion-welding
process in which coalescence is achieved by hot, electrically conductive molten slag acting
on the base parts and filler metal. As shown in Figure 30.24, the general configuration of
ESW is similar to electrogas welding. It is performed in a vertical orientation (shown here
for butt welding), using water-cooled molding shoes to contain the molten slag and weld
metal. At the start of the process, granulated conductive flux is put into the cavity. The
consumable electrode tip is positioned near the bottom of the cavity, and an arc is generated
for a short while to start melting the flux. Once a pool of slag has been created, the arc is
extinguished and the current passes from the electrode to the base metal through the
conductive slag, so that its electrical resistance generates heat to maintain the welding
process. Since the density of the slag is less than that of the molten metal, it remains on top to
protect the weld pool. Solidification occurs from the bottom, while additional molten metal
is supplied from above by the electrode and the edges of the base parts. The process
gradually continues until it reaches the top of the joint.
Thermit Welding Thermit is a trademark name for thermite, a mixture of aluminum
powder and iron oxide that produces an exothermic reaction when ignited. It is used in
incendiary bombs and for welding. As a welding process, the use of Thermit dates from
around 1900. Thermit welding (TW) is a fusion-welding process in which the heat for
coalescence is produced by superheated molten metal from the chemical reaction of
Thermit. Filler metal is obtained from the liquid metal; and although the process is used
for joining, it has more in common with casting than it does with welding.
Finely mixed powders of aluminum and iron oxide (in a 1:3 mixture), when
ignited at a temperature of around 1300 C (2300 F), produce the following chemical

reaction:

ð30:6Þ

The temperature from the reaction is around 2500 C (4500 F), resulting in superheated
molten iron plus aluminum oxide that floats to the top as a slag and protects the iron from
the atmosphere. In Thermit welding, the superheated iron (or steel if the mixture of
powders is formulated accordingly) is contained in a crucible located above the joint to be
welded, as indicated by our diagram of the TW process in Figure 30.25. After the reaction
is complete (about 30 s, irrespective of the amount of Thermit involved), the crucible is
tapped and the liquid metal flows into a mold built specially to surround the weld joint.
Because the entering metal is so hot, it melts the edges of the base parts, causing
coalescence upon solidification. After cooling, the mold is broken away, and the gates and
risers are removed by oxyacetylene torch or other method.
Thermit welding has applications in joining of railroad rails (as pictured in our
figure), and repair of cracks in large steel castings and forgings such as ingot molds, large
diameter shafts, frames for machinery, and ship rudders. The surface of the weld in these
applications is often sufficiently smooth so that no subsequent finishing is required.

30.5 SOLID-STATE WELDING
In solid state-welding, coalescence of the part surfaces is achieved by (1) pressure alone, or
(2) heat and pressure. For some solid-state processes, time is also a factor. If both heat and
pressure are used, the amount of heat by itself is not sufficient to cause melting of the work
surfaces. In other words, fusion of the parts would not occur using only the heat that is
externally applied in these processes. In some cases, the combination of heat and pressure,
or the particular manner in which pressure alone is applied, generates sufficient energy to
cause localized melting of the faying surfaces. Filler metal is not added in solid-state
welding.

30.5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN SOLID-STATE WELDING
In most of the solid-state processes, a metallurgical bond is created with little or no melting
of the base metals. To metallurgically bond two similar or dissimilar metals, the two metals
must be brought into intimate contact so that their cohesive atomic forces attract each
other. In normal physical contact between two surfaces, such intimate contact is prohibited
by the presence of chemical films, gases, oils, and so on. In order for atomic bonding to
succeed, these films and other substances must be removed. In fusion welding (as well as
other joining processes such as brazing and soldering), the films are dissolved or burned

E1C30

16:12:32

Page 733

Section 30.5/Solid-State Welding

733

away by high temperatures, and atomic bonding is established by the melting and
solidification of the metals in these processes. But in solid-state welding, the films and
other contaminants must be removed by other means to allow metallurgical bonding to
take place. In some cases, a thorough cleaning of the surfaces is done just before the welding
process; while in other cases, the cleaning action is accomplished as an integral part of
bringing the part surfaces together. To summarize, the essential ingredients for a successful
solid-state weld are that the two surfaces must be very clean, and they must be brought into
very close physical contact with each other to permit atomic bonding.
Welding processes that do not involve melting have several advantages over fusionwelding processes. If no melting occurs, then there is no heat-affected zone, and so the
metal surrounding the joint retains its original properties. Many of these processes
produce welded joints that comprise the entire contact interface between the two parts,
rather than at distinct spots or seams, as in most fusion-welding operations. Also, some of
these processes are quite applicable to bonding dissimilar metals, without concerns about
relative thermal expansions, conductivities, and other problems that usually arise when
dissimilar metals are melted and then solidified during joining.

30.5.2 SOLID STATE-WELDING PROCESSES
The solid-state welding group includes the oldest joining process as well as some of the
most modern. Each process in this group has its own unique way of creating the bond at
the faying surfaces. We begin our coverage with forge welding, the first welding process.
Forge Welding Forge welding is of historic significance in the development of
manufacturing technology. The process dates from about 1000 BCE, when blacksmiths
of the ancient world learned to join two pieces of metal (Historical Note 30.1). Forge
welding is a welding process in which the components to be joined are heated to hot
working temperatures and then forged together by hammer or other means. Considerable skill was required by the craftsmen who practiced it in order to achieve a good weld by
present-day standards. The process may be of historic interest; however, it is of minor
commercial importance today except for its variants that are discussed below.
Cold Welding Cold welding (CW) is a solid-state welding process accomplished by
applying high pressure between clean contacting surfaces at room temperature. The faying
surfaces must be exceptionally clean for CW to work, and cleaning is usually done by
degreasing and wire brushing immediately before joining. Also, at least one of the metals to
be welded, and preferably both, must be very ductile and free of work hardening. Metals
such as soft aluminum and copper can be readily cold welded. The applied compression
forces in the process result in cold working of the metal parts, reducing thickness by as much
as 50%; but they also cause localized plastic deformation at the contacting surfaces,
resulting in coalescence. For small parts, the forces may be applied by simple hand-operated
tools. For heavier work, powered presses are required to exert the necessary force. No heat
is applied from external sources in CW, but the deformation process raises the temperature
of the work somewhat. Applications of CW include making electrical connections.
Roll Welding Roll welding is a variation of either forge welding or cold welding,
depending on whether external heating of the workparts is accomplished prior to the
process. Roll welding (ROW) is a solid-state welding process in which pressure sufficient
to cause coalescence is applied by means of rolls, either with or without external
application of heat. The process is illustrated in Figure 30.26. If no external heat is
supplied, the process is called cold-roll welding; if heat is supplied, the term hot-roll
welding is used. Applications of roll welding include cladding stainless steel to mild or

welding (ROW).

low alloy steel for corrosion resistance, making bimetallic strips for measuring temperature, and producing ‘‘sandwich’’ coins for the U.S. mint.
Hot Pressure Welding Hot pressure welding (HPW) is another variation of forge welding
in which coalescence occurs from the application of heat and pressure sufficient to cause
considerable deformation of the base metals. The deformation disrupts the surface oxide film,
thus leaving clean metal to establish a good bond between the two parts. Time must be
allowed for diffusion to occur across the faying surfaces. The operation is usually carried out
in a vacuum chamber or in the presence of a shielding medium. Principal applications of
HPW are in the aerospace industry.
Diffusion Welding Diffusion welding (DFW) is a solid-state welding process that results
from the application of heat and pressure, usually in a controlled atmosphere, with
sufficient time allowed for diffusion and coalescence to occur. Temperatures are well
below the melting points of the metals (about 0.5 Tm is the maximum), and plastic
deformation at the surfaces is minimal. The primary mechanism of coalescence is solidstate diffusion, which involves migration of atoms across the interface between contacting
surfaces. Applications of DFW include the joining of high-strength and refractory metals in
the aerospace and nuclear industries. The process is used to join both similar and dissimilar
metals, and in the latter case a filler layer of a different metal is often sandwiched between
the two base metals to promote diffusion. The time for diffusion to occur between the faying
surfaces can be significant, requiring more than an hour in some applications [10].
Explosion Welding Explosion welding (EXW) is a solid-state welding process in which
rapid coalescence of two metallic surfaces is caused by the energy of a detonated explosive.
It is commonly used to bond two dissimilar metals, in particular to clad one metal on top of a
base metal over large areas. Applications include production of corrosion-resistant sheet
and plate stock for making processing equipment in the chemical and petroleum industries.
The term explosion cladding is used in this context. No filler metal is used in EXW, and no
external heat is applied. Also, no diffusion occurs during the process (the time is too short).
The nature of the bond is metallurgical, in many cases combined with a mechanical
interlocking that results from a rippled or wavy interface between the metals.
The process for cladding one metal plate on another can be described with
reference to Figure 30.27. In this setup, the two plates are in a parallel configuration,
separated by a certain gap distance, with the explosive charge above the upper plate,
called the flyer plate. A buffer layer (e.g., rubber, plastic) is often used between the
explosive and the flyer plate to protect its surface. The lower plate, called the backer
metal, rests on an anvil for support. When detonation is initiated, the explosive charge
propagates from one end of the flyer plate to the other, caught in the stop-action view
shown in Figure 30.27(2). One of the difficulties in comprehending what happens in EXW
is the common misconception that an explosion occurs instantaneously; it is actually a
progressive reaction, although admittedly very rapid—propagating at rates as high as

FIGURE 30.27 Explosive welding (EXW): (1) setup in the parallel configuration, and (2) during detonation of the

8500 m/s (28,000 ft/sec). The resulting high-pressure zone propels the flyer plate to collide
with the backer metal progressively at high velocity, so that it takes on an angular shape as
the explosion advances, as illustrated in our sketch. The upper plate remains in position in
the region where the explosive has not yet detonated. The high-speed collision, occurring
in a progressive and angular fashion as it does, causes the surfaces at the point of contact
to become fluid, and any surface films are expelled forward from the apex of the angle.
The colliding surfaces are thus chemically clean, and the fluid behavior of the metal,
which involves some interfacial melting, provides intimate contact between the surfaces,
leading to metallurgical bonding. Variations in collision velocity and impact angle during
the process can result in a wavy or rippled interface between the two metals. This kind of
interface strengthens the bond because it increases the contact area and tends to
mechanically interlock the two surfaces.
Friction Welding Friction welding is a widely used commercial process, amenable to
automated production methods. The process was developed in the (former) Soviet Union
and introduced into the United States around 1960. Friction welding (FRW) is a solidstate welding process in which coalescence is achieved by frictional heat combined with
pressure. The friction is induced by mechanical rubbing between the two surfaces, usually
by rotation of one part relative to the other, to raise the temperature at the joint interface
to the hot working range for the metals involved. Then the parts are driven toward each
other with sufficient force to form a metallurgical bond. The sequence is portrayed in
Figure 30.28 for welding two cylindrical parts, the typical application. The axial compression force upsets the parts, and a flash is produced by the material displaced. Any
surface films that may have been on the contacting surfaces are expunged during the
process. The flash must be subsequently trimmed (e.g., by turning) to provide a smooth
surface in the weld region. When properly carried out, no melting occurs at the faying
surfaces. No filler metal, flux, or shielding gases are normally used.
Nearly all FRW operations use rotation to develop the frictional heat for welding.
There are two principal drive systems, distinguishing two types of FRW: (1) continuousdrive friction welding, and (2) inertia friction welding. In continuous-drive friction
welding, one part is driven at a constant rotational speed and forced into contact with the
stationary part at a certain force level so that friction heat is generated at the interface.
When the proper hot working temperature has been reached, braking is applied to stop
the rotation abruptly, and simultaneously the pieces are forced together at forging
pressures. In inertia friction welding, the rotating part is connected to a flywheel, which
is brought up to a predetermined speed. Then the flywheel is disengaged from the drive
motor, and the parts are forced together. The kinetic energy stored in the flywheel is

dissipated in the form of friction heat to cause coalescence at the abutting surfaces. The
total cycle for these operations is about 20 seconds.
Machines used for friction welding have the appearance of an engine lathe. They
require a powered spindle to turn one part at high speed, and a means of applying an axial
force between the rotating part and the nonrotating part. With its short cycle times, the
process lends itself to mass production. It is applied in the welding of various shafts and
tubular parts in industries such as automotive, aircraft, farm equipment, petroleum, and
natural gas. The process yields a narrow heat-affected zone and can be used to join dissimilar
metals. However, at least one of the parts must be rotational, flash must usually be removed,
and upsetting reduces the part lengths (which must be taken into consideration in product
design).
The conventional friction welding operations discussed above utilize a rotary
motion to develop the required friction between faying surfaces. A more recent version
of the process is linear friction welding, in which a linear reciprocating motion is used to
generate friction heat between the parts. This eliminates the requirement for at least one
of the parts to be rotational (e.g., cylindrical, tubular).
Friction Stir Welding Friction stir welding (FSW), illustrated in Figure 30.29, is a solid
state welding process in which a rotating tool is fed along the joint line between two
workpieces, generating friction heat and mechanically stirring the metal to form the weld
seam. The process derives its name from this stirring or mixing action. FSW is distinguished from conventional FRW by the fact that friction heat is generated by a separate
wear-resistant tool rather than by the parts themselves. FSW was developed in 1991 at
The Welding Institute in Cambridge, UK.
The rotating tool is stepped, consisting of a cylindrical shoulder and a smaller probe
projecting beneath it. During welding, the shoulder rubs against the top surfaces of the
two parts, developing much of the friction heat, while the probe generates additional heat
by mechanically mixing the metal along the butt surfaces. The probe has a geometry
designed to facilitate the mixing action. The heat produced by the combination of friction

and mixing does not melt the metal but softens it to a highly plastic condition. As the tool
is fed forward along the joint, the leading surface of the rotating probe forces the metal
around it and into its wake, developing forces that forge the metal into a weld seam. The
shoulder serves to constrain the plasticized metal flowing around the probe.
The FSW process is used in the aerospace, automotive, railway, and shipbuilding
industries. Typical applications are butt joints on large aluminum parts. Other metals,
including steel, copper, and titanium, as well as polymers and composites have also been
joined using FSW. Advantages in these applications include (1) good mechanical
properties of the weld joint, (2) avoidance of toxic fumes, warping, shielding issues,
and other problems associated with arc welding, (3) little distortion or shrinkage, and
(4) good weld appearance. Disadvantages include (1) an exit hole is produced when the
tool is withdrawn from the work, and (2) heavy-duty clamping of the parts is required.
Ultrasonic Welding Ultrasonic welding (USW) is a solid-state welding process in
which two components are held together under modest clamping force, and oscillatory
shear stresses of ultrasonic frequency are applied to the interface to cause coalescence.
The operation is illustrated in Figure 30.30 for lap welding, the typical application. The
oscillatory motion between the two parts breaks down any surface films to allow

Chapter 30/Welding Processes

intimate contact and strong metallurgical bonding between the surfaces. Although heating
of the contacting surfaces occurs due to interfacial rubbing and plastic deformation, the
resulting temperatures are well below the melting point. No filler metals, fluxes, or
shielding gases are required in USW.
The oscillatory motion is transmitted to the upper workpart by means of a sonotrode,
which is coupled to an ultrasonic transducer. This device converts electrical power into
high-frequency vibratory motion. Typical frequencies used in USW are 15 to 75 kHz, with
amplitudes of 0.018 to 0.13 mm (0.0007–0.005 in). Clamping pressures are well below those
used in cold welding and produce no significant plastic deformation between the surfaces.
Welding times under these conditions are less than 1 sec.
USW operations are generally limited to lap joints on soft materials such as aluminum
and copper. Welding harder materials causes rapid wear of the sonotrode contacting the
upper workpart. Workparts should be relatively small, and welding thicknesses less than
3 mm (1/8 in) is the typical case. Applications include wire terminations and splicing in
electrical and electronics industries (eliminates the need for soldering), assembly of aluminum sheet-metal panels, welding of tubes to sheets in solar panels, and other tasks in small
parts assembly.

30.6 WELD QUALITY
The purpose of any welding process is to join two or more components into a single
structure. The physical integrity of the structure thus formed depends on the quality of the
weld. Our discussion of weld quality deals primarily with arc welding, the most widely used
welding process and the one for which the quality issue is the most critical and complex.
Residual Stresses and Distortion The rapid heating and cooling in localized regions
of the work during fusion welding, especially arc welding, result in thermal expansion and
contraction that cause residual stresses in the weldment. These stresses, in turn, can cause
distortion and warping of the welded assembly.
The situation in welding is complicated because (1) heating is very localized,
(2) melting of the base metals occurs in these local regions, and (3) the location of heating
and melting is in motion (at least in arc welding). Consider, for example, butt welding of
two plates by arc-welding as shown in Figure 30.31(a). The operation begins at one end
and travels to the opposite end. As it proceeds, a molten pool is formed from the base
metal (and filler metal, if used) that quickly solidifies behind the moving arc. The portions
of the work immediately adjacent to the weld bead become extremely hot and expand,
while portions removed from the weld remain relatively cool. The weld pool quickly
solidifies in the cavity between the two parts, and as it and the surrounding metal cool and
contract, shrinkage occurs across the width of the weldment, as seen in Figure 30.31(b).
The weld seam is left in residual tension, and reactionary compressive stresses are set up
in regions of the parts away from the weld. Residual stresses and shrinkage also occurs
along the length of the weld bead. Since the outer regions of the base parts have remained
relatively cool and dimensionally unchanged, while the weld bead has solidified from
very high temperatures and then contracted, residual tensile stresses remain longitudinally in the weld bead. These transverse and longitudinal stress patterns are depicted in
Figure 30.31(c). The net result of these residual stresses, transversely and longitudinally, is
likely to cause warping in the welded assembly as shown in Figure 30.31(d).
The arc-welded butt joint in our example is only one of a variety of joint types and
welding operations. Thermally induced residual stresses and the accompanying distortion
are a potential problem in nearly all fusion-welding processes and in certain solid-state
welding operations in which significant heating takes place. Following are some

techniques to minimize warping in a weldment: (1) Welding fixtures can be used to
physically restrain movement of the parts during welding. (2) Heat sinks can be used to
rapidly remove heat from sections of the welded parts to reduce distortion. (3) Tack
welding at multiple points along the joint can create a rigid structure prior to continuous
seam welding. (4) Welding conditions (speed, amount of filler metal used, etc.) can be
selected to reduce warping. (5) The base parts can be preheated to reduce the level of
thermal stresses experienced by the parts. (6) Stress relief heat treatment can be
performed on the welded assembly, either in a furnace for small weldments, or using
methods that can be used in the field for large structures. (7) Proper design of the
weldment itself can reduce the degree of warping.
Welding Defects In addition to residual stresses and distortion in the final assembly,
other defects can occur in welding. Following is a brief description of each of the major
categories, based on a classification in Cary [3]:
å Cracks. Cracks are fracture-type interruptions either in the weld itself or in the base
metal adjacent to the weld. This is perhaps the most serious welding defect because it
constitutes a discontinuity in the metal that significant reduces weld strength. Several
forms are defined in Figure 30.32. Welding cracks are caused by embrittlement or low
ductility of the weld and/or base metal combined with high restraint during contraction. Generally, this defect must be repaired.
å Cavities. These include various porosity and shrinkage voids. Porosity consists of
small voids in the weld metal formed by gases entrapped during solidification. The
shapes of the voids vary between spherical (blow holes) to elongated (worm holes).
Porosity usually results from inclusion of atmospheric gases, sulfur in the weld metal,
or contaminants on the surfaces. Shrinkage voids are cavities formed by shrinkage
during solidification. Both of these cavity-type defects are similar to defects found in
castings and emphasize the close kinship between casting and welding.
å Solid inclusions. These are nonmetallic solid materials trapped inside the weld
metal. The most common form is slag inclusions generated during arc-welding

processes that use flux. Instead of floating to the top of the weld pool, globules of slag
become encased during solidification of the metal. Another form of inclusion is
metallic oxides that form during the welding of metals such as aluminum, which
normally has a surface coating of Al2O3.
å Incomplete fusion. Several forms of this defect are illustrated in Figure 30.33. Also
known as lack of fusion, it is simply a weld bead in which fusion has not occurred
throughout the entire cross section of the joint. A related defect is lack of penetration
which means that fusion has not penetrated deeply enough into the root of the joint.
å Imperfect shape or unacceptable contour. The weld should have a certain desired
profile for maximum strength, as indicated in Figure 30.34(a) for a single V-groove
weld. This weld profile maximizes the strength of the welded joint and avoids

FIGURE 30.33 Several
forms of incomplete
fusion.

FIGURE 30.34 (a) Desired weld profile for single V-groove weld joint. Same joint but with
several weld defects: (b) undercut, in which a portion of the base metal part is melted away;
(c) underfill, a depression in the weld below the level of the adjacent base metal surface; and
(d) overlap, in which the weld metal spills beyond the joint onto the surface of the base part but
no fusion occurs.

incomplete fusion and lack of penetration. Some of the common defects in weld
shape and contour are illustrated in Figure 30.34.
å Miscellaneous defects. This category includes arc strikes, in which the welder
accidentally allows the electrode to touch the base metal next to the joint, leaving
a scar on the surface; and excessive spatter, in which drops of molten weld metal
splash onto the surface of the base parts.
Inspection and Testing Methods A variety of inspection and testing methods are
available to check the quality of the welded joint. Standardized procedures have been
developed and specified over the years by engineering and trade societies such as the
American Welding Society (AWS). For purposes of discussion, these inspection and
testing procedures can be divided into three categories: (1) visual, (2) nondestructive, and
(3) destructive.
Visual inspection is no doubt the most widely used welding inspection method. An
inspector visually examines the weldment for (1) conformance to dimensional specifications
on the part drawing, (2) warping, and (3) cracks, cavities, incomplete fusion, and other
visible defects. The welding inspector also determines if additional tests are warranted,
usually in the nondestructive category. The limitation of visual inspection is that only
surface defects are detectable; internal defects cannot be discovered by visual methods.
Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) includes various methods that do not damage
the specimen being inspected. Dye-penetrant and fluorescent-penetrant tests are methods for detecting small defects such as cracks and cavities that are open to the surface.
Fluorescent penetrants are highly visible when exposed to ultraviolet light, and their use
is therefore more sensitive than dyes.
Several other NDE methods should be mentioned. Magnetic particle testing is
limited to ferromagnetic materials. A magnetic field is established in the subject part, and
magnetic particles (e.g., iron filings) are sprinkled on the surface. Subsurface defects such
as cracks and inclusions reveal themselves by distorting the magnetic field, causing the
particles to be concentrated in certain regions on the surface. Ultrasonic testing involves
the use of high-frequency sound waves (>20 kHz) directed through the specimen.
Discontinuities (e.g., cracks, inclusions, porosity) are detected by losses in sound
transmission. Radiographic testing uses X-rays or gamma radiation to detect flaws
internal to the weld metal. It provides a photographic film record of any defects.
Destructive testing methods in which the weld is destroyed either during the test or to
prepare the test specimen. They include mechanical and metallurgical tests. Mechanical
tests are similar in purpose to conventional testing methods such as tensile tests and shear
tests (Chapter 3). The difference is that the test specimen is a weld joint. Figure 30.35
presents a sampling of the mechanical tests used in welding. Metallurgical tests involve the
preparation of metallurgical specimens of the weldment to examine such features as

FIGURE 30.35 Mechanical tests used in welding: (a) tension–shear test of arc weldment, (b) fillet break test,
(c) tension–shear test of spot weld, (d) peel test for spot weld.

metallic structure, defects, extent and condition of heat-affected zone, presence of other
elements, and similar phenomena.

30.7 WELDABILITY
Weldability is the capacity of a metal or combination of metals to be welded into a suitably
designed structure, and for the resulting weld joint(s) to possess the required metallurgical
properties to perform satisfactorily in the intended service. Good weldability is characterized by the ease with which the welding process is accomplished, absence of weld defects,
and acceptable strength, ductility, and toughness in the welded joint.
Factors that affect weldability include (1) welding process, (2) base metal properties, (3) filler metal, and (4) surface conditions. The welding process is significant. Some
metals or metal combinations that can be readily welded by one process are difficult to
weld by others. For example, stainless steel can be readily welded by most AW processes,
but is considered a difficult metal for oxyfuel welding.
Properties of the base metal affect welding performance. Important properties
include melting point, thermal conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion. One
might think that a lower melting point would mean easier welding. However, some metals
melt too easily for good welding (e.g., aluminum). Metals with high thermal conductivity
tend to transfer heat away from the weld zone, which can make them hard to weld (e.g.,
copper). High thermal expansion and contraction in the metal causes distortion problems
in the welded assembly.
Dissimilar metals pose special problems in welding when their physical and/or
mechanical properties are substantially different. Differences in melting temperature are
an obvious problem. Differences in strength or coefficient of thermal expansion may
result in high residual stresses that can lead to cracking. If a filler metal is used, it must be
compatible with the base metal(s). In general, elements mixed in the liquid state that
form a solid solution upon solidification will not cause a problem. Embrittlement in the
weld joint may occur if the solubility limits are exceeded.
Surface conditions of the base metals can adversely affect the operation. For
example, moisture can result in porosity in the fusion zone. Oxides and other solid films
on the metal surfaces can prevent adequate contact and fusion from occurring.

30.8 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN WELDING
If an assembly is to be permanently welded, the designer should follow certain guidelines
(compiled from [2], [3], and other sources):
å Design for welding. The most basic guideline is that the product should be designed
from the start as a welded assembly, and not as a casting or forging or other formed shape.
å Minimum parts. Welded assemblies should consist of the fewest number of parts
possible. For example, it is usually more cost efficient to perform simple bending
operations on a part than to weld an assembly from flat plates and sheets.
The following guidelines apply to arc welding:
å Good fit-up of parts to be welded is important to maintain dimensional control and
minimize distortion. Machining is sometimes required to achieve satisfactory fit-up.
å The assembly must provide access room to allow the welding gun to reach the
welding area.

positions (defined here
for groove welds): (a) flat,
(b) horizontal, (c) vertical,
and (d) overhead.

å Whenever possible, design of the assembly should allow flat welding to be performed,
since this is the fastest and most convenient welding position. The possible welding
positions are defined in Figure 30.36. The overhead position is the most difficult.
The following design guidelines apply to resistance spot welding:
å Low-carbon sheet steel up to 3.2 mm (0.125 in) is the ideal metal for resistance spot
welding.
å Additional strength and stiffness can be obtained in large flat sheet metal components by: (1) spot welding reinforcing parts into them, or (2) forming flanges and
embossments into them.
å The spot-welded assembly must provide access for the electrodes to reach the
welding area.
å Sufficient overlap of the sheet-metal parts is required for the electrode tip to make
proper contact in spot welding. For example, for low-carbon sheet steel, the overlap
distance should range from about six times stock thickness for thick sheets of 3.2 mm
(0.125 in) to about 20 times thickness for thin sheets, such as 0.5 mm (0.020 in).

PROBLEMS
Arc Welding
30.1. A SMAW operation is accomplished in a work cell
using a fitter and a welder. The fitter takes 5.5 min to
place the unwelded components into the welding fixture at the beginning of the work cycle, and 2.5 min to
unload the completed weldment at the end of the
cycle. The total length of the several weld seams to be
made is 2000 mm, and the travel speed used by the
welder averages 400 mm/min. Every 750 mm of weld
length, the welding stick must be changed, which takes
0.8 min. While the fitter is working, the welder is idle
(resting); and while the welder is working, the fitter is
idle. (a) Determine the average arc time in this
welding cycle. (b) How much improvement in arc
time would result if the welder used FCAW (manually operated), given that the spool of flux-cored
weld wire must be changed every five weldments,
and it takes the welder 5.0 min to accomplish the
change? (c) What are the production rates for these
two cases (weldments completed per hour)?
30.2. In the previous problem, suppose an industrial
robot cell were installed to replace the welder.
The cell consists of the robot (using GMAW instead of SMAW or FCAW), two welding fixtures,
and the fitter who loads and unloads the parts. With
two fixtures, fitter and robot work simultaneously,
the robot welding at one fixture while the fitter
unloads and loads at the other. At the end of each
work cycle, they switch places. The electrode wire
spool must be changed every five workparts, which
task requires 5.0 minutes and is accomplished by
the fitter. Determine (a) arc time and (b) production rate for this work cell.

30.3. A shielded metal arc-welding operation is performed
on steel at a voltage ¼ 30 Vand a current ¼ 225 A. The

transfer factor is 0.90. The welding current is 75 A
and the voltage is 16 V. The velocity of the welding
head is 40 in/min. The diameter of the electrode is
0.10 in. There is a core of flux running through the

30.8. A continuous weld is to be made around the circumference of a round steel tube of diameter ¼ 6.0 ft,
using a submerged arc-welding operation under
automatic control at a voltage of 25 V and current
of 300 A. The tube is slowly rotated under a stationary welding head. The heat transfer factor for SAW

cross-sectional area of the weld bead is 0.12 in2. If the
unit melting energy for the steel ¼ 150 Btu/in3,
determine (a) the rotational speed of the tube
and (b) the time required to complete the weld.

Resistance Welding
30.9. An RSW operation is used to make a series of spot
welds between two pieces of aluminum, each 2.0 mm
thick. The unit melting energy for aluminum ¼ 2.90 J/
mm3. Welding current ¼ 6000 A, and time duration ¼
0.15 sec. Assume that the resistance ¼ 75 micro-V.
The resulting weld nugget measures 5.0 mm in diameter by 2.5 mm thick. How much of the total energy
generated is used to form the weld nugget?
30.10. An RSW operation is used to join two pieces of
sheet steel having a unit melting energy of 130 Btu/
in3. The sheet steel has a thickness of 1/8 in. The
weld duration will be set at 0.25 sec with a current
of 11,000 A. Based on the electrode diameter, the
weld nugget will have a diameter of 0.30 in. Experience has shown that 40% of the supplied heat
melts the nugget and the rest is dissipated by the
metal. If the electrical resistance between the surfaces is 130 micro-V, what is the thickness of the
weld nugget assuming it has a uniform thickness?
30.11. The unit melting energy for a certain sheet metal is
9.5 J/mm3. The thickness of each of the two sheets
to be spot welded is 3.5 mm. To achieve required
strength, it is desired to form a weld nugget that is
5.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm thick. The weld
duration will be set at 0.3 sec. If it is assumed that
the electrical resistance between the surfaces is
140 micro-V, and that only one-third of the electrical energy generated will be used to form the
weld nugget (the rest being dissipated), determine
the minimum current level required in this
operation.
30.12. A resistance spot-welding operation is performed on
two pieces of 0.040-in thick sheet steel (low carbon).
The unit melting energy for steel ¼ 150 Btu/in3.
Process parameters are: current ¼ 9500 A and time
duration ¼ 0.17 sec. This results in a weld nugget of

diameter ¼ 0.19 in and thickness ¼ 0.060 in. Assume
the resistance ¼ 100 micro-V. Determine (a) the
average power density in the interface area defined
by the weld nugget, and (b) the proportion of
energy generated that went into formation of the
weld nugget.
30.13. A resistance seam-welding operation is performed
on two pieces of 2.5-mm-thick austenitic stainless
steel to fabricate a container. The weld current in the
operation is 10,000 A, the weld duration ¼ 0.3 sec,
and the resistance at the interface is 75 micro-V.
Continuous motion welding is used, with 200-mmdiameter electrode wheels. The individual weld
nuggets formed in this RSEW operation have
diameter ¼ 6 mm and thickness ¼ 3 mm (assume
the weld nuggets are disc-shaped). These weld
nuggets must be contiguous to form a sealed
seam. The power unit driving the process requires
an off-time between spot welds of 1.0 s. Given these
conditions, determine (a) the unit melting energy of
stainless steel using the methods of the previous
chapter, (b) the proportion of energy generated
that goes into the formation of each weld nugget,
and (c) the rotational speed of the electrode wheels.
30.14. Suppose in the previous problem that a roll spotwelding operation is performed instead of seam
welding. The interface resistance increases to
100 micro-V, and the center-to-center separation
between weld nuggets is 25 mm. Given the conditions from the previous problem, with the changes
noted here, determine (a) the proportion of energy
generated that goes into the formation of each
weld nugget, and (b) the rotational speed of the
electrode wheels. (c) At this higher rotational
speed, how much does the wheel move during
the current on-time, and might this have the effect

of elongating the weld nugget (making it elliptical
rather than round)?
30.15. Resistance projection welding is used to simultaneously weld two thin, steel plates together at four
locations. One of the pieces of steel plate is preformed with projections that have a diameter of
0.25 in and a height of 0.20 in. The duration of
current flow during the weld is 0.30 sec and all four
projections are welded simultaneously. The plate
steel has a unit melting energy of 140 Btu/in3 and a
resistance between plates of 90.0 micro-V. Experience has shown that 55% of the heat is dissipated
by the metal and 45% melts the weld nugget.
Assume the volume of the nuggets will be twice
the volume of the projections because metal from

747

both plates is melted. How much current is required for the process?
30.16. An experimental power source for spot welding is
designed to deliver current as a ramp function of
time: I ¼ 100,000 t, where I ¼ amp and t ¼ sec. At the
end of the power-on time, the current is stopped
abruptly. The sheet metal being spot welded is low
carbon steel whose unit melting energy ¼ 10 J/mm3.
The resistance R ¼ 85 micro-V. The desired weld
nugget diameter ¼ 4 mm and thickness ¼ 2 mm
(assume a disc-shaped nugget). It is assumed that 1/4
of the energy generated from the power source will
be used to form the weld nugget. Determine the
power-on time the current must be applied in order
to perform this spot-welding operation.

Oxyfuel Welding
30.17. Suppose in Example 30.3 in the text that the fuel
used in the welding operation is MAPP instead of
acetylene, and the proportion of heat concentrated
in the 9 mm circle is 60% instead of 75 %. Compute
(a) rate of heat liberated during combustion,
(b) rate of heat transferred to the work surface,
and (c) average power density in the circular area.
30.18. An oxyacetylene torch supplies 8.5 ft3 of acetylene per hour and an equal volume rate of oxygen

for an OAW operation on 1/4 in steel. Heat
generated by combustion is transferred to the
work surface with a heat transfer factor of 0.3.
If 80% of the heat from the flame is concentrated
in a circular area on the work surface whose
diameter ¼ 0.40 in, find: (a) rate of heat liberated
during combustion, (b) rate of heat transferred to
the work surface, and (c) average power density in
the circular area.

Electron Beam Welding
30.19. The voltage in an EBW operation is 45 kV. The
beam current is 60 milliamp. The electron beam is
focused on a circular area that is 0.25 mm in
diameter. The heat transfer factor is 0.87. Calculate the average power density in the area in watt/
mm2.
30.20. An electron-beam welding operation is to be accomplished to butt weld two sheet-metal parts that
are 3.0 mm thick. The unit melting energy ¼ 5.0 J/
mm3. The weld joint is to be 0.35 mm wide, so that
the cross section of the fused metal is 0.35 mm by
3.0 mm. If accelerating voltage ¼ 25 kV, beam
current ¼ 30 milliamp, heat transfer factor f1 ¼
0.85, and melting factor f2 ¼ 0.75, determine the
travel speed at which this weld can be made along
the seam.

30.21. An electron-beam welding operation will join two
pieces of steel plate together. The plates are 1.00 in
thick. The unit melting energy is 125 Btu/in3. The
diameter of the work area focus of the beam is
0.060 in, hence the width of the weld will be 0.060
in. The accelerating voltage is 30 kV and the beam
current is 35 milliamp. The heat transfer factor is 0.70
and the melting factor is 0.55. If the beam moves at a
speed of 50 in/min, will the beam penetrate the full
thickness of the plates?
30.22. An electron-beam welding operation uses the following process parameters: accelerating voltage ¼
25 kV, beam current ¼ 100 milliamp, and the circular
area on which the beam is focused has a diameter ¼
0.020 in. If the heat transfer factor ¼ 90%, determine
the average power density in the area in Btu/sec in2.

In this chapter, we consider three joining processes that are
similar to welding in certain respects: brazing, soldering, and
adhesive bonding. Brazing and soldering both use filler
metals to join and bond two (or more) metal parts to provide
a permanent joint. It is difficult, although not impossible, to
disassemble the parts after a brazed or soldered joint has
been made. In the spectrum of joining processes, brazing and
soldering lie between fusion welding and solid-state welding.
A filler metal is added in brazing and soldering as in most
fusion-welding operations; however, no melting of the base
metals occurs, which is similar to solid-state welding. Despite
these anomalies, brazing and soldering are generally considered to be distinct from welding. Brazing and soldering
are attractive compared to welding under circumstances
where (1) the metals have poor weldability, (2) dissimilar
metals are to be joined, (3) the intense heat of welding may
damage the components being joined, (4) the geometry of
the joint does not lend itself to any of the welding methods,
and/or (5) high strength is not a requirement.
Adhesive bonding shares certain features in common
with brazing and soldering. It utilizes the forces of attachment between a filler material and two closely spaced
surfaces to bond the parts. The differences are that the
filler material in adhesive bonding is not metallic, and the
joining process is carried out at room temperature or only
modestly above.

31.1

BRAZING

Brazing is a joining process in which a filler metal is melted
and distributed by capillary action between the faying
surfaces of the metal parts being joined. No melting of
the base metals occurs in brazing; only the filler melts. In
brazing the filler metal (also called the brazing metal), has
a melting temperature (liquidus) that is above 450 C
(840 F) but below the melting point (solidus) of the base

749

metal(s) to be joined. If the joint is properly designed and the brazing operation has been
properly performed, the brazed joint will be stronger than the filler metal out of which it
has been formed upon solidification. This rather remarkable result is due to the small part
clearances used in brazing, the metallurgical bonding that occurs between base and filler
metals, and the geometric constrictions that are imposed on the joint by the base parts.
Brazing has several advantages compared to welding: (1) any metals can be joined,
including dissimilar metals; (2) certain brazing methods can be performed quickly and
consistently, thus permitting high cycle rates and automated production; (3) some
methods allow multiple joints to be brazed simultaneously; (4) brazing can be applied
to join thin-walled parts that cannot be welded; (5) in general, less heat and power are
required than in fusion welding; (6) problems with the heat-affected zone in the base
metal near the joint are reduced; and (7) joint areas that are inaccessible by many welding
processes can be brazed, since capillary action draws the molten filler metal into the joint.
Disadvantages and limitations of brazing include (1) joint strength is generally less
than that of a welded joint; (2) although strength of a good brazed joint is greater than
that of the filler metal, it is likely to be less than that of the base metals; (3) high service
temperatures may weaken a brazed joint; and (4) the color of the metal in the brazed joint
may not match the color of the base metal parts, a possible aesthetic disadvantage.
Brazing as a production process is widely used in a variety of industries, including
automotive (e.g., joining tubes and pipes), electrical equipment (e.g., joining wires and
cables), cutting tools (e.g., brazing cemented carbide inserts to shanks), and jewelry
making. In addition, the chemical processing industry and plumbing and heating
contractors join metal pipes and tubes by brazing. The process is used extensively for
repair and maintenance work in nearly all industries.

31.1.1 BRAZED JOINTS
Brazed joints are commonly of two types: butt and lap (Section 29.2.1). However, the two
types have been adapted for the brazing process in several ways. The conventional butt
joint provides a limited area for brazing, thus jeopardizing the strength of the joint. To
increase the faying areas in brazed joints, the mating parts are often scarfed or stepped or
otherwise altered, as shown in Figure 31.1. Of course, additional processing is usually
required in the making of the parts for these special joints. One of the particular
difficulties associated with a scarfed joint is the problem of maintaining the alignment
of the parts before and during brazing.
Lap joints are more widely used in brazing, since they can provide a relatively large
interface area between the parts. An overlap of at least three times the thickness of the
thinner part is generally considered good design practice. Some adaptations of the lap
joint for brazing are illustrated in Figure 31.2. An advantage of brazing over welding in

lap joints is that the filler metal is bonded to the base parts throughout the entire interface
area between the parts, rather than only at the edges (as in fillet welds made by arc
welding) or at discrete spots (as in resistance spot welding).
Clearance between mating surfaces of the base parts is important in brazing. The
clearance must be large enough so as not to restrict molten filler metal from flowing
throughout the entire interface. Yet if the joint clearance is too great, capillary action will be
reduced and there will be areas between the parts where no filler metal is present. Joint
strength is affected by clearance, as depicted in Figure 31.3. There is an optimum clearance
value at which joint strength is maximized. The issue is complicated by the fact that the
optimum depends on base and filler metals, joint configuration, and processing conditions.
Typical brazing clearances in practice are 0.025 to 0.25 mm (0.001 to 0.010 in). These values
represent the joint clearance at the brazing temperature, which may be different from room
temperature clearance, depending on thermal expansion of the base metal(s).
Cleanliness of the joint surfaces prior to brazing is also important. Surfaces must be
free of oxides, oils, and other contaminants in order to promote wetting and capillary
attraction during the process, as well as bonding across the entire interface. Chemical

treatments such as solvent cleaning (Section 28.1.1) and mechanical treatments such as
wire brushing and sand blasting (Section 28.1.2) are used to clean the surfaces. After
cleaning and during the brazing operation, fluxes are used to maintain surface cleanliness
and promote wetting for capillary action in the clearance between faying surfaces.

31.1.2 FILLER METALS AND FLUXES
Common filler metals used in brazing are listed in Table 31.1 along with the principal base
metals on which they are typically used. To qualify as a brazing metal, the following
characteristics are needed: (1) melting temperature must be compatible with the base
metal, (2) surface tension in the liquid phase must be low for good wettability, (3) fluidity
of the molten metal must be high for penetration into the interface, (4) the metal must be
capable of being brazed into a joint of adequate strength for the application, and
(5) chemical and physical interactions with base metal (e.g., galvanic reaction) must
be avoided. Filler metals are applied to the brazing operation in various ways, including
wire, rod, sheets and strips, powders, pastes, preformed parts made of braze metal designed
to fit a particular joint configuration, and cladding on one of the surfaces to be brazed.
Several of these techniques are illustrated in Figures 31.4 and 31.5. Braze metal pastes,
shown in Figure 31.5, consist of filler metal powders mixed with fluid fluxes and binders.
Brazing fluxes serve a similar purpose as in welding; they dissolve, combine with,
and otherwise inhibit the formation of oxides and other unwanted byproducts in the
brazing process. Use of a flux does not substitute for the cleaning steps described above.
Characteristics of a good flux include (1) low melting temperature, (2) low viscosity so
that it can be displaced by the filler metal, (3) facilitates wetting, and (4) protects the joint
until solidification of the filler metal. The flux should also be easy to remove after
brazing. Common ingredients for brazing fluxes include borax, borates, fluorides, and
chlorides. Wetting agents are also included in the mix to reduce surface tension of the
molten filler metal and to improve wettability. Forms of flux include powders, pastes, and
slurries. Alternatives to using a flux are to perform the operation in a vacuum or a
reducing atmosphere that inhibits oxide formation.

31.1.3 BRAZING METHODS
There are various methods used in brazing. Referred to as brazing processes, they are
differentiated by their heating sources.

753

Torch Brazing In torch brazing, flux is applied to the part surfaces and a torch is used to
direct a flame against the work in the vicinity of the joint. A reducing flame is typically used to
inhibit oxidation. After the workpart joint areas have been heated to a suitable temperature,
filler wire is added to the joint, usually in wire or rod form. Fuels used in torch brazing include
acetylene, propane, and other gases, with air or oxygen. The selection of the mixture depends
on heating requirements of the job. Torch brazing is often performed manually, and skilled
workers must be employed to control the flame, manipulate the hand-held torches, and
properly judge the temperatures; repair work is a common application. The method can also
be used in mechanized production operations, in which parts and brazing metal are loaded
onto a conveyor or indexing table and passed under one or more torches.
Furnace Brazing Furnace brazing uses a furnace to supply heat for brazing and is best
suited to medium and high production. In medium production, usually in batches, the
component parts and brazing metal are loaded into the furnace, heated to brazing temperature, and then cooled and removed. High-production operations use flow-through furnaces,
in which parts are placed on a conveyor and are transported through the various heating and
cooling sections. Temperature and atmosphere control are important in furnace brazing; the
atmosphere must be neutral or reducing. Vacuum furnaces are sometimes used. Depending
on the atmosphere and metals being brazed, the need for a flux may be eliminated.
Induction Brazing Induction brazing utilizes heat from electrical resistance to a highfrequency current induced in the work. The parts are preloaded with filler metal and
placed in a high-frequency AC field—the parts do not directly contact the induction coil.
Frequencies range from 5 kHz to 5 MHz. High-frequency power sources tend to provide
surface heating, while lower frequencies cause deeper heat penetration into the work and
are appropriate for heavier sections. The process can be used to meet low- to highproduction requirements.
Resistance Brazing Heat to melt the filler metal in this process is obtained by
resistance to flow of electrical current through the parts. As distinguished from induction
brazing, the parts are directly connected to the electrical circuit in resistance brazing. The
equipment is similar to that used in resistance welding, except that a lower power level is
required for brazing. The parts with filler metal preplaced are held between electrodes
while pressure and current are applied. Both induction and resistance brazing achieve
rapid heating cycles and are used for relatively small parts. Induction brazing seems to be
the more widely used of the two processes.
Dip Brazing In dip brazing, either a molten salt bath or a molten metal bath accomplishes
heating. In both methods, assembled parts are immersed in the baths contained in a heating
pot. Solidification occurs when the parts are removed from the bath. In the salt bath
method, the molten mixture contains fluxing ingredients and the filler metal is preloaded
onto the assembly. In the metal bath method, the molten filler metal is the heating medium;
it is drawn by capillary action into the joint during submersion. A flux cover is maintained
on the surface of the molten metal bath. Dip brazing achieves fast heating cycles and can be
used to braze many joints on a single part or on multiple parts simultaneously.
Infrared Brazing This method uses heat from a high-intensity infrared lamp. Some IR
lamps are capable of generating up to 5000 W of radiant heat energy, which can be
directed at the workparts for brazing. The process is slower than most of the other
processes reviewed above, and is generally limited to thin sections.
Braze Welding This process differs from the other brazing processes in the type of joint
to which it is applied. As pictured in Figure 31.6, braze welding is used for filling a more

conventional weld joint, such as the V-joint shown. A greater quantity of filler metal is
deposited than in brazing, and no capillary action occurs. In braze welding, the joint
consists entirely of filler metal; the base metal does not melt and is therefore not fused
into the joint as in a conventional fusion welding process. The principal application of
braze welding is repair work.

31.2 SOLDERING
Soldering is similar to brazing and can be defined as a joining process in which a filler
metal with melting point (liquidus) not exceeding 450 C (840 F) is melted and distributed by capillary action between the faying surfaces of the metal parts being joined. As in
brazing, no melting of the base metals occurs, but the filler metal wets and combines with
the base metal to form a metallurgical bond. Details of soldering are similar to those of
brazing, and many of the heating methods are the same. Surfaces to be soldered must be
precleaned so they are free of oxides, oils, and so on. An appropriate flux must be applied
to the faying surfaces, and the surfaces are heated. Filler metal, called solder, is added to
the joint, which distributes itself between the closely fitting parts.
In some applications, the solder is precoated onto one or both of the surfaces—a
process called tinning, irrespective of whether the solder contains any tin. Typical clearances
in soldering range from 0.075 to 0.125 mm (0.003–0.005 in), except when the surfaces are
tinned, in which case a clearance of about 0.025 mm (0.001 in) is used. After solidification,
the flux residue must be removed.
As an industrial process, soldering is most closely associated with electronics
assembly (Chapter 35). It is also used for mechanical joints, but not for joints subjected
to elevated stresses or temperatures. Advantages attributed to soldering include (1) low
energy input relative to brazing and fusion welding, (2) variety of heating methods
available, (3) good electrical and thermal conductivity in the joint, (4) capability to make
air-tight and liquid-tight seams for containers, and (5) easy to repair and rework.
The biggest disadvantages of soldering are (1) low joint strength unless reinforced
by mechanically means and (2) possible weakening or melting of the joint in elevated
temperature service.

31.2.1 JOINT DESIGNS IN SOLDERING
As in brazing, soldered joints are limited to lap and butt types, although butt joints should
not be used in load-bearing applications. Some of the brazing adaptations of these joints
also apply to soldering, and soldering technology has added a few more variations of its
own to deal with the special part geometries that occur in electrical connections. In
soldered mechanical joints of sheet-metal parts, the edges of the sheets are often bent
over and interlocked before soldering, as shown in Figure 31.7, to increase joint strength.
For electronics applications, the principal function of the soldered joint is to provide
an electrically conductive path between two parts being joined. Other design considerations in these types of soldered joints include heat generation (from the electrical resistance
of the joint) and vibration. Mechanical strength in a soldered electrical connection is often

achieved by deforming one or both of the metal parts to accomplish a mechanical joint
between them, or by making the surface area larger to provide maximum support by the
solder. Several possibilities are sketched in Figure 31.8.

31.2.2 SOLDERS AND FLUXES
Solders and fluxes are the materials used in soldering. Both are critically important in the
joining process.
Solders Most solders are alloys of tin and lead, since both metals have low melting points
(see Figure 6.3). Their alloys possess a range of liquidus and solidus temperatures to achieve
good control of the soldering process for a variety of applications. Lead is poisonous and its
percentage is minimized in most solder compositions. Tin is chemically active at soldering
temperatures and promotes the wetting action required for successful joining. In soldering
copper, common in electrical connections, intermetallic compounds of copper and tin are
formed that strengthen the bond. Silver and antimony are also sometimes used in soldering

alloys. Table 31.2 lists various solder alloy compositions, indicating their approximate
soldering temperatures and principal applications. Lead-free solders are becoming increasingly important as legislation to eliminate lead from solders is enacted.
Soldering Fluxes Soldering fluxes should do the following: (1) be molten at soldering
temperatures, (2) remove oxide films and tarnish from the base part surfaces, (3) prevent
oxidation during heating, (4) promote wetting of the faying surfaces, (5) be readily
displaced by the molten solder during the process, and (6) leave a residue that is
noncorrosive and nonconductive. Unfortunately, there is no single flux that serves all
of these functions perfectly for all combinations of solder and base metals. The flux
formulation must be selected for a given application.
Soldering fluxes can be classified as organic or inorganic. Organic fluxes are made
of either rosin (i.e., natural rosin such as gum wood, which is not water-soluble) or watersoluble ingredients (e.g., alcohols, organic acids, and halogenated salts). The watersoluble type facilitates cleanup after soldering. Organic fluxes are most commonly used
for electrical and electronics connections. They tend to be chemically reactive at elevated
soldering temperatures but relatively noncorrosive at room temperatures. Inorganic
fluxes consist of inorganic acids (e.g., muriatic acid) and salts (e.g., combinations of zinc
and ammonium chlorides) and are used to achieve rapid and active fluxing where oxide
films are a problem. The salts become active when melted, but are less corrosive than the
acids. When solder wire is purchased with an acid core it is in this category.
Both organic and inorganic fluxes should be removed after soldering, but it is especially
important in the case of inorganic acids to prevent continued corrosion of the metal surfaces.
Flux removal is usually accomplished using water solutions except in the case of rosins, which
require chemical solvents. Recent trends in industry favor water-soluble fluxes over rosins
because chemical solvents used with rosins are harmful to the environment and to humans.

31.2.3 SOLDERING METHODS
Many of the methods used in soldering are the same as those used in brazing, except that
less heat and lower temperatures are required for soldering. These methods include torch

E1C31

17:28:5

Page 757

Section 31.2/Soldering

757

soldering, furnace soldering, induction soldering, resistance soldering, dip soldering, and
infrared soldering. There are other soldering methods, not used in brazing, that should be
described here. These methods are hand soldering, wave soldering, and reflow soldering.
Hand Soldering Hand soldering is performed manually using a hot soldering iron. A
bit, made of copper, is the working end of a soldering iron. Its functions are (1) to deliver
heat to the parts being soldered, (2) to melt the solder, (3) to convey molten solder to the
joint, and (4) to withdraw excess solder. Most modern soldering irons are heated by
electrical resistance. Some are designed as fast-heating soldering guns, which are popular
in electronics assembly for intermittent (on/off) operation actuated by a trigger. They are
capable of making a solder joint in about a second.
Wave Soldering Wave soldering is a mechanized technique that allows multiple lead
wires to be soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) as it passes over a wave of molten
solder. The typical setup is one in which a PCB, on which electronic components have been
placed with their lead wires extending through the holes in the board, is loaded onto a
conveyor for transport through the wave-soldering equipment. The conveyor supports the
PCB on its sides, so that its underside is exposed to the processing steps, which consist of the
following: (1) flux is applied using any of several methods, including foaming, spraying, or
brushing; (2) preheating (using light bulbs, heating coils, and infrared devices) to
evaporate solvents, activate the flux, and raise the temperature of the assembly; and
(3) wave soldering, in which the liquid solder is pumped from a molten bath through a slit
onto the bottom of the board to make the soldering connections between the lead wires
and the metal circuit on the board. This third step is illustrated in Figure 31.9. The board is
often inclined slightly, as depicted in the sketch, and a special tinning oil is mixed with the
molten solder to lower its surface tension. Both of these measures help to inhibit buildup
of excess solder and formation of ‘‘icicles’’ on the bottom of the board. Wave soldering is
widely applied in electronics to produce printed circuit board assemblies (Section 35.3.2).
Reflow Soldering This process is also widely used in electronics to assemble surface
mount components to printed circuit boards (Section 35.4.2). In the process, a solder
paste consisting of solder powders in a flux binder is applied to spots on the board where
electrical contacts are to be made between surface mount components and the copper
circuit. The components are then placed on the paste spots, and the board is heated to
melt the solder, forming mechanical and electrical bonds between the component leads
and the copper on the circuit board.
Heating methods for reflow soldering include vapor phase reflow and infrared
reflow. In vapor phase reflow soldering, an inert fluorinated hydrocarbon liquid is
vaporized by heating in an oven; it subsequently condenses on the board surface where
it transfers its heat of vaporization to melt the solder paste and form solder joints on the

printed circuit boards. In infrared reflow soldering, heat from an infrared lamp is used to
melt the solder paste and form joints between component leads and circuit areas on the
board. Additional heating methods to reflow the solder paste include use of hot plates, hot
air, and lasers.

31.3 ADHESIVE BONDING
Use of adhesives dates back to ancient times (Historical Note 31.1) and adhesive bonding
was probably the first of the permanent joining methods. Today, adhesives are used in a
wide range of bonding and sealing applications for joining similar and dissimilar materials
such as metals, plastics, ceramics, wood, paper, and cardboard. Although well-established
as a joining technique, adhesive bonding is considered a growth area among assembly
technologies because of the tremendous opportunities for increased applications.

Historical Note 31.1

A

Adhesive bonding

dhesives date from ancient times. Carvings 3300 years
old show a glue pot and brush for gluing veneer to wood
planks. The ancient Egyptians used gum from the Acacia
tree for various assembly and sealing purposes. Bitumen,
an asphalt adhesive, was used in ancient times as a
cement and mortar for construction in Asia Minor. The
Romans used pine wood tar and beeswax to caulk their
ships. Glues derived from fish, stag horns, and cheese
were used in the early centuries after Christ for
assembling components of wood.
In more modern times, adhesives have become an
important joining process. Plywood, which relies on

the use of adhesives to bond multiple layers of wood,
was developed around 1900. Phenol formaldehyde
was the first synthetic adhesive developed, around
1910, and its primary use was in bonding of wood
products such as plywood. During World War II,
phenolic resins were developed for adhesive bonding
of certain aircraft components. In the 1950s, epoxies
were first formulated. And since the 1950s a variety of
additional adhesives have been developed, including
anaerobics, various new polymers, and secondgeneration acrylics.

Adhesive bonding is a joining process in which a filler material is used to hold two (or
more) closely spaced parts together by surface attachment. The filler material that binds the
parts together is the adhesive. It is a nonmetallic substance—usually a polymer. The parts
being joined are called adherends. Adhesives of greatest interest in engineering are
structural adhesives, which are capable of forming strong, permanent joints between strong,
rigid adherends. A large number of commercially available adhesives are cured by various
mechanisms and suited to the bonding of various materials. Curing refers to the process by
which the adhesive’s physical properties are changed from a liquid to a solid, usually by
chemical reaction, to accomplish the surface attachment of the parts. The chemical reaction
may involve polymerization, condensation, or vulcanization. Curing is often motivated by
heat and/or a catalyst, and pressure is sometimes applied between the two parts to activate
the bonding process. If heat is required, the curing temperatures are relatively low, and so
the materials being joined are usually unaffected—an advantage for adhesive bonding. The
curing or hardening of the adhesive takes time, called curing time or setting time. In some
cases this time is significant—generally a disadvantage in manufacturing.
Joint strength in adhesive bonding is determined by the strength of the adhesive itself
and the strength of attachment between adhesive and each of the adherends. One of the
criteria often used to define a satisfactory adhesive joint is that if a failure should occur due

E1C31

11/09/2009

17:28:6

Page 759

Section 31.3/Adhesive Bonding

759

to excessive stresses, it occurs in one of the adherends rather than at an interface or within
the adhesive itself. The strength of the attachment results from several mechanisms, all
depending on the particular adhesive and adherends: (1) chemical bonding, in which the
adhesive unites with the adherends and forms a primary chemical bond upon hardening;
(2) physical interactions, in which secondary bonding forces result between the atoms of
the opposing surfaces; and (3) mechanical interlocking, in which the surface roughness of
the adherend causes the hardened adhesive to become entangled or trapped in its
microscopic surface asperities.
For these adhesion mechanisms to operate with best results, the following conditions
must prevail: (1) surfaces of the adherend must be clean—free of dirt, oil, and oxide films
that would interfere with achieving intimate contact between adhesive and adherend;
special preparation of the surfaces is often required; (2) the adhesive in its initial liquid
form must achieve thorough wetting of the adherend surface; and (3) it is usually helpful
for the surfaces to be other than perfectly smooth—a slightly roughened surface increases
the effective contact area and promotes mechanical interlocking. In addition, the joint
must be designed to exploit the particular strengths of adhesive bonding and avoid its
limitations.

31.3.1 JOINT DESIGN
Adhesive joints are not generally as strong as those by welding, brazing, or soldering.
Accordingly, consideration must be given to the design of joints that are adhesively bonded.
The following design principles are applicable: (1) Joint contact area should be maximized.
(2) Adhesive joints are strongest in shear and tension as in Figure 31.10(a) and (b), and
joints should be designed so that the applied stresses are of these types. (3) Adhesive
bonded joints are weakest in cleavage or peeling as in Figure 31.10(c) and (d), and
adhesive bonded joints should be designed to avoid these types of stresses.
Typical joint designs for adhesive bonding that illustrate these design principles are
presented in Figure 31.11. Some joint designs combine adhesive bonding with other joining
methods to increase strength and/or provide sealing between the two components. Some of
the possibilities are shown in Figure 31.12. For example, the combination of adhesive
bonding and spot welding is called weldbonding.
In addition to the mechanical configuration of the joint, the application must be
selected so that the physical and chemical properties of adhesive and adherends are
compatible under the service conditions to which the assembly will be subjected. Adherend
materials include metals, ceramics, glass, plastics, wood, rubber, leather, cloth, paper, and
cardboard. Note that the list includes materials that are rigid and flexible, porous and

nonporous, metallic and nonmetallic, and that similar or dissimilar substances can be
bonded together.

31.3.2 ADHESIVE TYPES
A large number of commercial adhesives are available. They can be classified into three
categories: (1) natural, (2) inorganic, and (3) synthetic.
Natural adhesives are derived from natural sources (e.g., plants and animals),
including gums, starch, dextrin, soy flour, and collagen. This category of adhesive is generally
limited to low-stress applications, such as cardboard cartons, furniture, and bookbinding; or
where large surface areas are involved (e.g., plywood). Inorganic adhesives are based
principally on sodium silicate and magnesium oxychloride. Although relatively low in cost,
they are also low in strength—a serious limitation in a structural adhesive.
Synthetic adhesives constitute the most important category in manufacturing. They
include a variety of thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, many of which are listed
and briefly described in Table 31.3. They are cured by various mechanisms, such as

FIGURE 31.12 Adhesive bonding combined with other joining methods:
(a) weldbonding—spot welded and adhesive bonded; (b) riveted (or bolted) and
adhesive bonded; and (c) formed plus adhesive bonded.

(1) mixing a catalyst or reactive ingredient with the polymer immediately prior to applying,
(2) heating to initiate the chemical reaction, (3) radiation curing, such as ultraviolet
light, and (4) curing by evaporation of water from the liquid or paste adhesive. In addition,
some synthetic adhesives are applied as films or as pressure-sensitive coatings on the
surface of one of the adherends.

31.3.3 ADHESIVE APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY
Industrial applications of adhesive bonding are widespread and growing. Major users
are automotive, aircraft, building products, and packaging industries; other industries
include footwear, furniture, bookbinding, electrical, and shipbuilding. Table 31.3 indicates
some of the specific applications for which synthetic adhesives are used. In this section we
consider several issues relating to adhesives application technology.
Surface Preparation In order for adhesive bonding to succeed, part surfaces must be
extremely clean. The strength of the bond depends on the degree of adhesion between
adhesive and adherend, and this depends on the cleanliness of the surface. In most cases,
additional processing steps are required for cleaning and surface preparation, the methods
varying with different adherend materials. For metals, solvent wiping is often used for
cleaning, and abrading the surface by sand blasting or other process usually improves

E1C31

Chapter 31/Brazing, Soldering, and Adhesive Bonding

adhesion. For nonmetallic parts, solvent cleaning is generally used, and the surfaces are
sometimes mechanically abraded or chemically etched to increase roughness. It is desirable
to accomplish the adhesive bonding process as soon as possible after these treatments, since
surface oxidation and dirt accumulation increase with time.
Application Methods The actual application of the adhesive to one or both part
surfaces is accomplished in a number of ways. The following list, though incomplete,
provides a sampling of the techniques used in industry:
å Brushing, performed manually, uses a stiff-bristled brush. Coatings are often uneven.
å Flowing, using manually operated pressure-fed flow guns, has more consistent
control than brushing.
å Manual rollers, similar to paint rollers, are used to apply adhesive from a flat
container.
å Silk screening involves brushing the adhesive through the open areas of the screen
onto the part surface, so that only selected areas are coated.
å Spraying uses an air-driven (or airless) spray gun for fast application over large or
difficult-to-reach areas.
å Automatic applicators include various automatic dispensers and nozzles for use on
medium- and high-speed production applications. Figure 31.13 illustrates the use of a
dispenser for assembly.
å Roll coating is a mechanized technique in which a rotating roller is partially
submersed in a pan of liquid adhesive and picks up a coating of the adhesive, which
is then transferred to the work surface. Figure 31.14 shows one possible application,
in which the work is a thin, flexible material (e.g., paper, cloth, leather, plastic).
Variations of the method are used for coating adhesive onto wood, wood composite,
cardboard, and similar materials with large surface areas.

Advantages and Limitations Advantages of adhesive bonding are (1) the process is
applicable to a wide variety of materials; (2) parts of different sizes and cross sections can be
joined—fragile parts can be joined by adhesive bonding; (3) bonding occurs over the entire
surface area of the joint, rather than in discrete spots or along seams as in fusion welding,
thereby distributing stresses over the entire area; (4) some adhesives are flexible after
bonding and are thus tolerant of cyclical loading and differences in thermal expansion of
adherends; (5) low temperature curing avoids damage to parts being joined; (6) sealing as
well as bonding can be achieved; and (7) joint design is often simplified (e.g., two flat
surfaces can be joined without providing special part features such as screw holes).
Principal limitations of this technology include (1) joints are generally not as strong
as other joining methods; (2) adhesive must be compatible with materials being joined;
(3) service temperatures are limited; (4) cleanliness and surface preparation prior to
application of adhesive are important; (5) curing times can impose a limit on production
rates; and (6) inspection of the bonded joint is difficult.

Mechanical assembly uses various methods to mechanically
attach two (or more) parts together. In most cases, the method
involves the use of discrete hardware components, called
fasteners, that are added to the parts during the assembly
operation. In other cases, the method involves the shaping or
reshaping of one of the components being assembled, and no
separate fasteners are required. Many consumer products are
produced using mechanical assembly: automobiles, large and
small appliances, telephones, furniture, utensils—even wearing apparel is ‘‘assembled’’ by mechanical means. In addition,
industrial products such as airplanes, machine tools, and
construction equipment almost always involve mechanical
assembly.
Mechanical fastening methods can be divided into
two major classes: (1) those that allow for disassembly, and
(2) those that create a permanent joint. Threaded fasteners
(e.g., screws, bolts, and nuts) are examples of the first class,
and rivets illustrate the second. There are good reasons why
mechanical assembly is often preferred over other joining
processes discussed in previous chapters. The main reasons
are (1) ease of assembly and (2) ease of disassembly (for the
fastening methods that permit disassembly).
Mechanical assembly is usually accomplished by unskilled workers with a minimum of special tooling and in a
relatively short time. The technology is simple, and the
results are easily inspected. These factors are advantageous
not only in the factory, but also during field installation.
Large products that are too big and heavy to be transported
completely assembled can be shipped in smaller subassemblies and then put together at the customer’s site.
Ease of disassembly applies, of course, only to the
mechanical fastening methods that permit disassembly.
Periodic disassembly is required for many products so
that maintenance and repair can be performed; for example, to replace worn-out components, make adjustments,
and so forth. Permanent joining techniques such as welding
do not allow for disassembly.

For purposes of organization, we divide mechanical assembly methods into the
following categories: (1) threaded fasteners, (2) rivets, (3) interference fits, (4) other
mechanical fastening methods, and (5) molded-in inserts and integral fasteners. These
categories are described in Sections 32.1 through 32.5. In Section 32.6, we discuss an
important issue in assembly: design for assembly. Assembly of electronic products
includes mechanical techniques. However, electronics assembly represents a unique
and specialized field, which is covered in Chapter 35.

32.1

THREADED FASTENERS
Threaded fasteners are discrete hardware components that have external or internal
threads for assembly of parts. In nearly all cases, they permit disassembly. Threaded
fasteners are the most important category of mechanical assembly; the common threaded
fastener types are screws, bolts, and nuts.

32.1.1 SCREWS, BOLTS, AND NUTS
Screws and bolts are threaded fasteners that have external threads. There is a technical
distinction between a screw and a bolt that is often blurred in popular usage. A screw is an
externally threaded fastener that is generally assembled into a blind threaded hole. Some
types, called self-tapping screws, possess geometries that permit them to form or cut the
matching threads in the hole. A bolt is an externally threaded fastener that is inserted
through holes in the parts and ‘‘screwed’’ into a nut on the opposite side. A nut is an
internally threaded fastener having standard threads that match those on bolts of the
same diameter, pitch, and thread form. The typical assemblies that result from the use of
screws and bolts are illustrated in Figure 32.1.
Screws and bolts come in a variety of standard sizes, threads, and shapes. Table 32.1
provides a selection of common threaded fastener sizes in metric units (ISO standard)
and U.S. customary units (ANSI standard). (ISO is the abbreviation for the International
Standards Organization. ANSI is the abbreviation for the American National Standards
Institute.)
The metric specification consists of the nominal major diameter, mm, followed by the
pitch, mm. For example, a specification of 4-0.7 means a 4.0-mm major diameter and a pitch
of 0.7 mm. The U.S. standard specifies either a number designating the major diameter (up
to 0.2160 in) or the nominal major diameter, in, followed by the number of threads per inch.
For example, the specification 1/4-20 indicates a major diameter of 0.25 in and 20 threads
per inch. Both coarse pitch and fine pitch standards are given in our table.
Additional technical data on these and other standard threaded fastener sizes can
be found in design texts and handbooks. The United States has been gradually converting

to metric thread sizes, which will reduce proliferation of specifications. It should be noted
that differences among threaded fasteners have tooling implications in manufacturing. To
use a particular type of screw or bolt, the assembly worker must have tools that are
designed for that fastener type. For example, there are numerous head styles available on
bolts and screws, the most common of which are shown in Figure 32.2. The geometries of
these heads, as well as the variety of sizes available, require different hand tools (e.g.,
screwdrivers) for the worker. One cannot turn a hex-head bolt with a conventional flatblade screwdriver.
Screws come in a greater variety of configurations than bolts, since their functions
vary more. The types include machine screws, capscrews, setscrews, and self-tapping screws.
Machine screws are the generic type, designed for assembly into tapped holes. They are
sometimes assembled to nuts, and in this usage they overlap with bolts. Capscrews have the
same geometry as machine screws but are made of higher strength metals and to closer
tolerances. Setscrews are hardened and designed for assembly functions such as fastening
collars, gears, and pulleys to shafts as shown in Figure 32.3(a). They come in various
geometries, some of which are illustrated in Figure 32.3(b). A self-tapping screw (also
called a tapping screw) is designed to form or cut threads in a preexisting hole into which it
is being turned. Figure 32.4 shows two of the typical thread geometries for self-tapping
screws.

Most threaded fasteners are produced by cold forming (Section 19.2). Some are
machined (Sections 22.2.2, 22.3.2, and 22.7.1), but this is usually a more expensive threadmaking process. A variety of materials are used to make threaded fasteners, steels being
the most common because of their good strength and low cost. These include low and
medium carbon as well as alloy steels. Fasteners made of steel are usually plated or coated
for superficial resistance to corrosion. Nickel, chromium, zinc, black oxide, and similar
coatings are used for this purpose. When corrosion or other factors deny the use of steel
fasteners, other materials must be used, including stainless steels, aluminum alloys, nickel
alloys, and plastics (however, plastics are suited to low stress applications only).

32.1.2 OTHER THREADED FASTENERS AND RELATED HARDWARE
Additional threaded fasteners and related hardware include studs, screw thread inserts,
captive threaded fasteners, and washers. A stud (in the context of fasteners) is an
externally threaded fastener, but without the usual head possessed by a bolt. Studs can be
used to assemble two parts using two nuts as shown in Figure 32.5(a). They are available
with threads on one end or both as in Figure 32.5(b) and (c).

thread inserts: (a) before

Screw thread inserts are internally threaded plugs or wire coils made to be inserted
into an unthreaded hole and to accept an externally threaded fastener. They are assembled
into weaker materials (e.g., plastic, wood, and light-weight metals such as magnesium) to
provide strong threads. There are many designs of screw thread inserts, one example of
which is illustrated in Figure 32.6. Upon subsequent assembly of the screw into the insert,
the insert barrel expands into the sides of the hole, securing the assembly.
Captive threaded fasteners are threaded fasteners that have been permanently
preassembled to one of the parts to be joined. Possible preassembly processes include
welding, brazing, press fitting, or cold forming. Two types of captive threaded fasteners
are illustrated in Figure 32.7.
A washer is a hardware component often used with threaded fasteners to ensure
tightness of the mechanical joint; in its simplest form, it is a flat thin ring of sheet metal.
Washers serve various functions. They (1) distribute stresses that might otherwise be
concentrated at the bolt or screw head and nut, (2) provide support for large clearance

the joint, and (6) resist inadvertent unfastening [13]. Three washer types are illustrated in
Figure 32.8.

32.1.3 STRESSES AND STRENGTHS IN BOLTED JOINTS
Typical stresses acting on a bolted or screwed joint include both tensile and shear, as depicted
in Figure 32.9. Shown in the figure is a bolt-and-nut assembly. Once tightened, the bolt is
loaded in tension, and the parts are loaded in compression. In addition, forces may be acting
in opposite directions on the parts, which results in a shear stress on the bolt cross section.
Finally, there are stresses applied on the threads throughout their engagement length with the
nut in a direction parallel to the axis of the bolt. These shear stresses can cause stripping of the
threads. (This failure can also occur on the internal threads of the nut.)
The strength of a threaded fastener is generally specified by two measures:
(1) tensile strength, which has the traditional definition (Section 3.1.1), and (2) proof
strength. Proof strength is roughly equivalent to yield strength; specifically, it is the
maximum tensile stress to which an externally threaded fastener can be subjected without
permanent deformation. Typical values of tensile and proof strength for steel bolts are
given in Table 32.2.
The problem that can arise during assembly is that the threaded fasteners are
overtightened, causing stresses that exceed the strength of the fastener material. Assuming
a bolt-and-nut assembly as shown in Figure 32.9, failure can occur in one of the following
ways: (1) external threads (e.g., bolt or screw) can strip, (2) internal threads (e.g., nut) can
strip, or (3) the bolt can break because of excessive tensile stresses on its cross-sectional

area. Thread stripping, failures (1) and (2), is a shear failure and occurs when the length of
engagement is too short (less than about 60% of the nominal bolt diameter). This can be
avoided by providing adequate thread engagement in the fastener design. Tensile failure
(3) is the most common problem. The bolt breaks at about 85% of its rated tensile strength
because of combined tensile and torsion stresses during tightening [2].
The tensile stress to which a bolt is subjected can be calculated as the tensile load
applied to the joint divided by the applicable area:
s¼

F
As

ð32:1Þ

where s ¼ stress, MPa (lb/in2); F ¼ load, N (lb); and As ¼ tensile stress area, mm2 (in2).
This stress is compared to the bolt strength values listed in Table 32.2. The tensile
stress area for a threaded fastener is the cross-sectional area of the minor diameter. This
area can be calculated directly from one of the following equations [2], depending on
whether the bolt is metric standard or American standard. For the metric standard (ISO),
the formula is

where D ¼ nominal size (basic major diameter) of the bolt or screw, in; and n ¼ the

32.1.4 TOOLS AND METHODS FOR THREADED FASTENERS
The basic function of the tools and methods for assembling threaded fasteners is to provide
relative rotation between the external and internal threads, and to apply sufficient torque to
secure the assembly. Available tools range from simple hand-held screwdrivers or wrenches
to powered tools with sophisticated electronic sensors to ensure proper tightening. It is
important that the tool match the screw or bolt and/or the nut in style and size, since there
are so many heads available. Hand tools are usually made with a single point or blade, but
powered tools are generally designed to use interchangeable bits. The powered tools
operate by pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric power.
Whether a threaded fastener serves its intended purpose depends to a large degree on
the amount of torque applied to tighten it. Once the bolt or screw (or nut) has been rotated
until it is seated against the part surface, additional tightening will increase the tension in
the fastener (and simultaneously the compression in the parts being held together); and the

E1C32

11/09/2009

17:29:12

Page 773

Section 32.2/Rivets and Eyelets

773

tightening will be resisted by an increasing torque. Thus, there is a correlation between
the torque required to tighten the fastener and the tensile stress experienced by it. To
achieve the desired function in the assembled joint (e.g., to improve fatigue resistance) and
to lock the threaded fasteners, the product designer will often specify the tension force that
should be applied. This force is called the preload. The following relationship can be used to
determine the required torque to obtain a specified preload [13]:
T ¼ Ct DF

ð32:4Þ

where T ¼ torque, N-mm (lb-in); Ct ¼ the torque coefficient whose value typically ranges
between 0.15 and 0.25, depending on the thread surface conditions; D ¼ nominal bolt or
screw diameter, mm (in); and F ¼ specified preload tension force, N (lb).
Various methods are employed to apply the required torque, including (1) operator
feel—not very accurate, but adequate for most assemblies; (2) torque wrenches, which
measure the torque as the fastener is being turned; (3) stall-motors, which are motorized
wrenches designed to stall when the required torque is reached, and (4) torque-turn
tightening, in which the fastener is initially tightened to a low torque level and then
rotated a specified additional amount (e.g., a quarter turn).

32.2

RIVETS AND EYELETS
Rivets are widely used for achieving a permanent mechanically fastened joint. Riveting is
a fastening method that offers high production rates, simplicity, dependability, and low
cost. Despite these apparent advantages, its applications have declined in recent decades
in favor of threaded fasteners, welding, and adhesive bonding. Riveting is one of the
primary fastening processes in the aircraft and aerospace industries for joining skins to
channels and other structural members.
A rivet is an unthreaded, headed pin used to join two (or more) parts by passing the
pin through holes in the parts and then forming (upsetting) a second head in the pin on
the opposite side. The deforming operation can be performed hot or cold (hot working or
cold working), and by hammering or steady pressing. Once the rivet has been deformed,
it cannot be removed except by breaking one of the heads. Rivets are specified by their
length, diameter, head, and type. Rivet type refers to five basic geometries that affect how
the rivet will be upset to form the second head. The five types are defined in Figure 32.10.
In addition, there are special rivets for special applications.

Fastening with an eyelet:
(a) the eyelet, and
(b) assembly sequence:
(1) inserting the eyelet
through the hole and
(2) setting operation.

Rivets are used primarily for lap joints. The clearance hole into which the rivet is
inserted must be close to the diameter of the rivet. If the hole is too small, rivet insertion
will be difficult, thus reducing production rate. If the hole is too large, the rivet will not fill
the hole and may bend or compress during formation of the opposite head. Rivet design
tables are available to specify the optimum hole sizes.
The tooling and methods used in riveting can be divided into the following categories:
(1) impact, in which a pneumatic hammer delivers a succession of blows to upset the rivet;
(2) steady compression, in which the riveting tool applies a continuous squeezing pressure
to upset the rivet; and (3) a combination of impact and compression. Much of the
equipment used in riveting is portable and manually operated. Automatic drilling-and-riveting
machines are available for drilling the holes and then inserting and upsetting the rivets.
Eyelets are thin-walled tubular fasteners with a flange on one end, usually made from
sheet metal, as in Figure 32.11(a). They are used to produce a permanent lap joint between
two (or more) flat parts. Eyelets are substituted for rivets in low-stress applications to save
material, weight, and cost. During fastening, the eyelet is inserted through the part holes,
and the straight end is formed over to secure the assembly. The forming operation is called
setting and is performed by opposing tools that hold the eyelet in position and curl the
extended portion of its barrel. Figure 32.11(b) illustrates the sequence for a typical eyelet
design. Applications of this fastening method include automotive subassemblies, electrical
components, toys, and apparel.

32.3 ASSEMBLY METHODS BASED ON INTERFERENCE FITS
Several assembly methods are based on mechanical interference between the two mating
parts being joined. This interference, which occurs either during assembly or after the
parts are joined, holds the parts together. The methods include press fitting, shrink and
expansion fits, snap fits, and retaining rings.
Press Fitting A press fit assembly is one in which the two components have an
interference fit between them. The typical case is where a pin (e.g., a straight cylindrical

shaft assembled to a collar by interference fit.

pin) of a certain diameter is pressed into a hole of a slightly smaller diameter. Standard pin
sizes are commercially available to accomplish a variety of functions, such as (1) locating and
locking the components—used to augment threaded fasteners by holding two (or more)
parts in fixed alignment with each other; (2) pivot points, to permit rotation of one
component about the other; and (3) shear pins. Except for (3), the pins are normally
hardened. Shear pins are made of softer metals so as to break under a sudden or severe
shearing load to save the rest of the assembly. Other applications of press fitting include
assembly of collars, gears, pulleys, and similar components onto shafts.
The pressures and stresses in an interference fit can be estimated using several
applicable formulas. If the fit consists of a round solid pin or shaft inside a collar (or similar
component), as depicted in Figure 32.12, and the components are made of the same
material, the radial pressure between the pin and the collar can be determined by [13]:
pf ¼



Ei D2c  D2p
Dp D2c

ð32:5Þ

where pf ¼ radial or interference fit pressure, MPa (lb/in2); E ¼ modulus of elasticity for the
material; i ¼ interference between the pin (or shaft) and the collar; that is, the starting
difference between the inside diameter of the collar hole and the outside diameter of the pin,
mm (in); Dc ¼ outside diameter of the collar, mm (in); and Dp ¼ pin or shaft diameter,
mm (in).
The maximum effective stress occurs in the collar at its inside diameter and can be
calculated as
Max s e ¼

2pf D2c
D2c  D2p

ð32:6Þ

where Max se ¼ the maximum effective stress, MPa (lb/in2), and pf is the interference fit
pressure computed from Eq. (32.5).
In situations in which a straight pin or shaft is pressed into the hole of a large part with
geometry other than that of a collar, we can alter the previous equations by taking the
outside diameter Dc to be infinite, thus reducing the equation for interference pressure to
pf ¼

Ei
Dp

ð32:7Þ

and the corresponding maximum effective stress becomes
Max s e ¼ 2pf

ð32:8Þ

E1C32

11/09/2009

776

17:29:13

Page 776

Chapter 32/Mechanical Assembly

In most cases, particularly for ductile metals, the maximum effective stress should be
compared with the yield strength of the material, applying an appropriate safety factor, as in
the following:
Max s e 

Y
SF

ð32:9Þ

where Y ¼ yield strength of the material, and SF is the applicable safety factor.
Various pin geometries are available for interference fits. The basic type is a straight
pin, usually made from cold-drawn carbon steel wire or bar stock, ranging in diameter from
1.6 to 25 mm (1/16 to 1.0 in). They are unground, with chamfered or square ends (chamfered
ends facilitate press fitting). Dowel pins are manufactured to more precise specifications
than straight pins, and can be ground and hardened. They are used to fix the alignment of
assembled components in dies, fixtures, and machinery. Taper pins possess a taper of 6.4 mm
(0.25 in) per foot and are driven into the hole to establish a fixed relative position between
the parts. Their advantage is that they can readily be driven back out of the hole.
Additional pin geometries are commercially available, including grooved pins—
solid straight pins with three longitudinal grooves in which the metal is raised on either
side of each groove to cause interference when the pin is pressed into a hole; knurled
pins, pins with a knurled pattern that causes interference in the mating hole; and coiled
pins, also called spiral pins, which are made by rolling strip stock into a coiled spring.
Shrink and Expansion Fits These terms refer to the assembly of two parts that have an
interference fit at room temperature. The typical case is a cylindrical pin or shaft assembled
into a collar. To assemble by shrink fitting, the external part is heated to enlarge it by
thermal expansion, and the internal part either remains at room temperature or is cooled to
contract its size. The parts are then assembled and brought back to room temperature, so
that the external part shrinks, and if previously cooled the internal part expands, to form a
strong interference fit. An expansion fit is when only the internal part is cooled to contract
it for assembly; once inserted into the mating component, it warms to room temperature,
expanding to create the interference assembly. These assembly methods are used to fit
gears, pulleys, sleeves, and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.
Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the workparts. Heating equipment
includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction heaters.
Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice, and immersion
in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in diameter depends on the
coefficient of thermal expansion and the temperature difference that is applied to the part.
If we assume that the heating or cooling has produced a uniform temperature throughout
the work, then the change in diameter is given by
D2  D1 ¼ a D1 ðT 2  T 1 Þ

ð32:10Þ

where a ¼ the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, mm/mm- C (in/in- F) for the material
(see Table 4.1); T2 ¼ the temperature to which the parts have been heated or cooled,  C ( F);
T1 ¼ starting ambient temperature; D2 ¼ diameter of the part at T2, mm (in); and D1 ¼
diameter of the part at T1.
Equations (32.5) through (32.9) for computing interference pressures and effective
stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and expansion fits.
Snap Fits and Retaining Rings Snap fits are a variation of interference fits. A snap fit
involves joining two parts in which the mating elements possess a temporary interference
while being pressed together, but once assembled they interlock to maintain the assembly.
A typical example is shown in Figure 32.13: as the parts are pressed together, the mating
elements elastically deform to accommodate the interference, subsequently allowing the

parts to snap together; once in position, the elements become connected mechanically so
that they cannot easily be disassembled. The parts are usually designed so that a slight
interference exists after assembly.
Advantages of snap fit assembly include (1) the parts can be designed with selfaligning features, (2) no special tooling is required, and (3) assembly can be accomplished
very quickly. Snap fitting was originally conceived as a method that would be ideally suited
to industrial robotics applications; however, it is no surprise that assembly techniques that
are easier for robots are also easier for human assembly workers.
A retaining ring, also known as a snap ring, is a fastener that snaps into a circumferential groove on a shaft or tube to form a shoulder, as in Figure 32.14. The assembly can be
used to locate or restrict the movement of parts mounted on the shaft. Retaining rings are
available for both external (shaft) and internal (bore) applications. They are made from
either sheet metal or wire stock, heat treated for hardness and stiffness. To assemble a
retaining ring, a special pliers tool is used to elastically deform the ring so that it fits over the
shaft (or into the bore) and then is released into the groove.

32.4

OTHER MECHANICAL FASTENING METHODS
In addition to the mechanical assembly techniques discussed in the preceding, there are
several additional methods that involve the use of fasteners. These include stitching, stapling,
sewing, and cotter pins.
Stitching, Stapling, and Sewing Industrial stitching and stapling are similar operations
involving the use of U-shaped metal fasteners. Stitching is a fastening operation in which a
stitching machine is used to form the U-shaped stitches one at a time from steel wire and
immediately drive them through the two parts to be joined. Figure 32.15 illustrates several

types of wire stitches. The parts to be joined must be relatively thin, consistent with the stitch
size, and the assembly can involve various combinations of metal and nonmetal materials.
Applications of industrial stitching include light sheetmetal assembly, metal hinges, electrical
connections, magazine binding, corrugated boxes, and final product packaging. Conditions
that favor stitching in these applications are (1) high-speed operation, (2) elimination of the
need for prefabricated holes in the parts, and (3) desirability of using fasteners that encircle
the parts.
In stapling, preformed U-shaped staples are punched through the two parts to be
attached. The staples are supplied in convenient strips. The individual staples are lightly stuck
together to form the strip, but they can be separated by the stapling tool for driving. The staples
come with various point styles to facilitate their entry into the work. Staples are usually applied
by means of portable pneumatic guns, into which strips containing several hundred staples can
be loaded. Applications of industrial stapling include: furniture and upholstery, assembly of
car seats, and various light-gage sheetmetal and plastic assembly jobs.
Sewing is a common joining method for soft, flexible parts such as cloth and leather.
The method involves the use of a long thread or cord interwoven with the parts so as to
produce a continuous seam between them. The process is widely used in the needle trades
industry for assembling garments.
Cotter Pins Cotter pins are fasteners formed from half-round wire into a single two-stem
pin, as in Figure 32.16. They vary in diameter, ranging between 0.8 mm (0.031 in) and 19 mm
(3/4 in), and in point style, several of which are shown in the figure. Cotter pins are inserted
into holes in the mating parts and their legs are split to lock the assembly. They are used to
secure parts onto shafts and similar applications.

32.5 MOLDING INSERTS AND INTEGRAL FASTENERS
These assembly methods form a permanent joint between parts by shaping or reshaping
one of the components through a manufacturing process such as casting, molding, or
sheet-metal forming.

Inserts in Moldings and Castings This method involves the placement of a component
into a mold before plastic molding or metal casting, so that it becomes a permanent and
integral part of the molding or casting. Inserting a separate component is preferable to
molding or casting its shape if the superior properties (e.g., strength) of the insert material
are required, or the geometry achieved through the use of the insert is too complex or
intricate to incorporate into the mold. Examples of inserts in molded or cast parts include
internally threaded bushings and nuts, externally threaded studs, bearings, and electrical
contacts. Some of these are illustrated in Figure 32.17. Internally threaded inserts must be
placed into the mold with threaded pins to prevent the molding material from flowing into
the threaded hole.
Placing inserts into a mold has certain disadvantages in production: (1) design of the
mold becomes more complicated; (2) handling and placing the insert into the cavity takes
time that reduces production rate; and (3) inserts introduce a foreign material into the
casting or molding, and in the event of a defect, the cast metal or plastic cannot be easily
reclaimed and recycled. Despite these disadvantages, use of inserts is often the most
functional design and least-cost production method.
Integral Fasteners Integral fasteners involve deformation of component parts so they
interlock and create a mechanically fastened joint. This assembly method is most common
for sheetmetal parts. The possibilities, Figure 32.18, include (a) lanced tabs to attach wires
or shafts to sheet-metal parts; (b) embossed protrusions, in which bosses are formed in one
part and flattened over the mating assembled part; (c) seaming, where the edges of two
separate sheet-metal parts or the opposite edges of the same part are bent over to form the
fastening seam—the metal must be ductile in order for the bending to be feasible;
(d) beading, in which a tube-shaped part is attached to a smaller shaft (or other round
part) by deforming the outer diameter inward to cause an interference around the entire
circumference; and (e) dimpling—forming of simple round indentations in an outer part to
retain an inner part.
Crimping, in which the edges of one part are deformed over a mating component, is
another example of integral assembly. A common example involves squeezing the barrel
of an electrical terminal onto a wire (Section 35.5.1).

DESIGN FOR ASSEMBLY
Design for assembly (DFA) has received much attention in recent years because assembly
operations constitute a high labor cost for many manufacturing companies. The key to
successful design for assembly can be simply stated [3]: (1) design the product with as few
parts as possible, and (2) design the remaining parts so they are easy to assemble. The cost
of assembly is determined largely during product design, because that is when the number

of separate components in the product is determined, and decisions are made about how
these components will be assembled. Once these decisions have been made, there is little
that can be done in manufacturing to influence assembly costs (except, of course, to
manage the operations well).
In this section we consider some of the principles that can be applied during
product design to facilitate assembly. Most of the principles have been developed in the
context of mechanical assembly, although some of them apply to the other assembly and
joining processes. Much of the research in design for assembly has been motivated by the
increasing use of automated assembly systems in industry. Accordingly, our discussion is
divided into two sections, the first dealing with general principles of DFA, and the second
concerned specifically with design for automated assembly.

and assemble: (a) only

(b) two possible orientations; (c) four possible
orientations; and (d) infinite rotational
orientations.

32.6.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DFA
Most of the general principles apply to both manual and automated assembly. Their goal
is to achieve the required design function by the simplest and lowest cost means. The
following recommendations have been compiled from [1], [3], [4], and [6]:
å Use the fewest number of parts possible to reduce the amount of assembly required.
This principle is implemented by combining functions within the same part that might
otherwise be accomplished by separate components (e.g., using a plastic molded part
instead of an assembly of sheet metal parts).
å Reduce the number of threaded fasteners required. Instead of using separate threaded
fasteners, design the component to utilize snap fits, retaining rings, integral fasteners,
and similar fastening mechanisms that can be accomplished more rapidly. Use threaded
fasteners only where justified (e.g., where disassembly or adjustment is required).
å Standardize fasteners. This is intended to reduce the number of sizes and styles of
fasteners required in the product. Ordering and inventory problems are reduced, the
assembly worker does not have to distinguish between so many separate fasteners,
the workstation is simplified, and the variety of separate fastening tools is reduced.
å Reduce parts orientation difficulties. Orientation problems are generally reduced by
designing a part to be symmetrical and minimizing the number of asymmetric features.
This allows easier handling and insertion during assembly. This principle is illustrated in
Figure 32.19.
å Avoid parts that tangle. Certain part configurations are more likely to become
entangled in parts bins, frustrating assembly workers or jamming automatic feeders.
Parts with hooks, holes, slots, and curls exhibit more of this tendency than parts without
these features. See Figure 32.20.

tangling.

32.6.2 DESIGN FOR AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY
Methods suitable for manual assembly are not necessarily the best methods for automated
assembly. Some assembly operations readily performed by a human worker are quite
difficult to automate (e.g., assembly using bolts and nuts). To automate the assembly process,
parts fastening methods must be specified during product design that lend themselves to
machine insertion and joining techniques and do not require the senses, dexterity, and
intelligence of human assembly workers. Following are some recommendations and
principles that can be applied in product design to facilitate automated assembly [6], [10]:
å Use modularity in product design. Increasing the number of separate tasks that are
accomplished by an automated assembly system will reduce the reliability of the system.
To alleviate the reliability problem, Riley [10] suggests that the design of the product be
modular in which each module or subassembly has a maximum of 12 or 13 parts to be
produced on a single assembly system. Also, the subassembly should be designed around
a base part to which other components are added.
å Reduce the need for multiple components to be handled at once. The preferred
practice for automated assembly is to separate the operations at different stations rather
than to simultaneously handle and fasten multiple components at the same workstation.
å Limit the required directions of access. This means that the number of directions in
which new components are added to the existing subassembly should be minimized.
Ideally, all components should be added vertically from above, if possible.
å High-quality components. High performance of an automated assembly system
requires that consistently good-quality components are added at each workstation.
Poor quality components cause jams in feeding and assembly mechanisms that result in
downtime.
å Use of snap fit assembly. This eliminates the need for threaded fasteners; assembly is
by simple insertion, usually from above. It requires that the parts be designed with
special positive and negative features to facilitate insertion and fastening.

32.6. Threaded metric fasteners are available in several
systems, two of which are coarse and fine (Table

the proof strength for both bolts is 600 MPa.
A torque wrench is used on a 3/4-10 UNC bolt in an

The designer has specified that a 3/8-16 UNC lowcarbon bolt (3/8 in nominal diameter, 16 threads/

In this part of the book, we discuss a collection of processing and assembly technologies that do not fit neatly into our
classification scheme in Figure 1.4. They are technologies
that have been adapted from the conventional manufacturing and assembly operations or developed from scratch to
serve the special functions or needs of designers and
manufacturers. Rapid prototyping, covered in the present
chapter, is a collection of processes used to fabricate a
model, part, or tool in minimum possible time. Chapters 34
and 35 discuss technologies used in electronics manufacturing, an activity of significant economic importance. Chapter 34 covers integrated circuit processing, and Chapter 35
covers electronics assembly and packaging. Chapters 36
and 37 survey some of the technologies used to produce
very small parts and products. Chapter 36 describes microfabrication technologies used to produce items measured in
microns (106 m), whereas Chapter 37 discusses nanofabrication technologies for producing items measured in
nanometers (109 m). The processes covered in these five
chapters are relatively new. Rapid prototyping dates from
about 1988. Modern electronics production techniques
date from around 1960 (Historical Note 34.1), although
dramatic advances have been made in electronics processing since that time. The microfabrication technologies
discussed in Chapter 36 followed soon after electronics

processing. Finally, the nanofabrication technologies represent an emerging field today
that dates from the 1990s.
Rapid prototyping (RP) is a family of fabrication methods to make engineering
prototypes in minimum possible lead times based on a computer-aided design (CAD)
model of the item. The traditional method of fabricating a prototype part is machining,
which can require significant lead times—up to several weeks, sometimes longer,
depending on part complexity, difficulty in ordering materials, and scheduling production
equipment. A number of rapid prototyping techniques are now available that allow a part
to be produced in hours or days rather than weeks, given that a computer model of the
part has been generated on a CAD system.

33.1

FUNDAMENTALS OF RAPID PROTOTYPING
The special need that motivates the variety of rapid prototyping technologies arises because
product designers would like to have a physical model of a new part or product design rather
than a computer model or line drawing. The creation of a prototype is an integral step in the
design procedure. A virtual prototype, which is a computer model of the part design on a
CAD system, may not be adequate for the designer to visualize the part. It certainly is not
sufficient to conduct real physical tests on the part, although it is possible to perform
simulated tests by finite element analysis or other methods. Using one of the available RP
technologies, a solid physical part can be created in a relatively short time (hours if the
company possesses the RP equipment or days if the part fabrication must be contracted to an
outside firm specializing in RP). The designer can therefore visually examine and physically
feel the part and begin to perform tests and experiments to assess its merits and shortcomings.
Available rapid prototyping technologies can be divided into two basic categories: (1)
material removal processes and (2) material addition processes. The material removal
RP alternative involves machining (Chapter 22), primarily milling and drilling, using a
dedicated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine that is available to the design
department on short notice. To use CNC, a part program must be prepared from the CAD
model (Section 38.3.3). The starting material is often a solid block of wax, which is very
easy to machine, and the part and chips can be melted and resolidified for reuse when the
current prototype is no longer needed. Other starting materials can also be used, such as
wood, plastics, or metals (e.g., a machinable grade of aluminum or brass). The CNC
machines used for rapid prototyping are often small, and the terms desktop milling or
desktop machining are sometimes used for this technology. Maximum starting block sizes
in desktop machining are typically 180 mm (7 in) in the x-direction, 150 mm (6 in) in the
y-direction, and 150 mm (6 in) in the z-direction [2].
The principal emphasis in this chapter is on material-addition RP technologies, all of
which work by adding layers of material one at a time to build the solid part from bottom to
top. Starting materials include (1) liquid monomers that are cured layer by layer into solid
polymers, (2) powders that are aggregated and bonded layer by layer, and (3) solid sheets
that are laminated to create the solid part. In addition to starting material, what distinguishes the various material addition RP technologies is the method of building and adding
the layers to create the solid part. Some techniques use lasers to solidify the starting
material, another deposits a soft plastic filament in the outline of each layer, while others
bond solid layers together. There is a correlation between the starting material and the partbuilding techniques, as we shall see in our discussion of RP technologies.
The common approach to prepare the control instructions (part program) in all of
the current material addition RP techniques involves the following steps [6]:
1. Geometric modeling. This consists of modeling the component on a CAD system to
define its enclosed volume. Solid modeling is the preferred technique because it

provides a complete and unambiguous mathematical representation of the geometry. For rapid prototyping, the important issue is to distinguish the interior (mass) of
the part from its exterior, and solid modeling provides for this distinction.
2. Tessellation of the geometric model1. In this step, the CAD model is converted into a
format that approximates its surfaces by triangles or polygons, with their vertices
arranged to distinguish the object’s interior from its exterior. The common tessellation
format used in rapid prototyping is STL, which has become the de facto standard input
format for nearly all RP systems.
3. Slicing of the model into layers. In this step, the model in STL2 file format is sliced
into closely spaced parallel horizontal layers. Conversion of a solid model into layers is
illustrated in Figure 33.1. These layers are subsequently used by the RP system to
construct the physical model. By convention, the layers are formed in the x-y plane
orientation, and the layering procedure occurs in the z-axis direction. For each layer, a
curing path is generated, called the STI file, which is the path that will be followed by
the RP system to cure (or otherwise solidify) the layer.
As our brief overview indicates, there are several different technologies used for material
addition rapid prototyping. This heterogeneity has spawned several alternative names for
rapid prototyping, including layer manufacturing, direct CAD manufacturing, and solid
freeform fabrication. The term rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RPM) is also
being used more frequently to indicate that the RP technologies can be applied to make
production parts and production tooling, not just prototypes.

33.2 RAPID PROTOTYPING TECHNOLOGIES
The 25 or so RP techniques currently developed can be classified in various ways. Let us
adopt a classification system recommended in [6], which is consistent with the way we
classify part-shaping processes in this book (after all, rapid prototyping is a part-shaping

More generally, the term tessellation refers to the laying out or creation of a mosaic, such as one
consisting of small colored tiles affixed to a surface for decoration.

process). The classification method is based on the form of the starting material in the RP
process: (1) liquid-based, (2) solid-based, and (3) powder-based. We discuss examples of
each class in the following three sections.

33.2.1 LIQUID-BASED RAPID PROTOTYPING SYSTEMS
The starting material in these technologies is a liquid. About a dozen RP technologies are
in this category, of which we have selected the following to describe: (1) stereolithography, (2) solid ground curing, and (3) droplet deposition manufacturing.
Stereolithography This was the first material addition RP technology, dating from
about 1988 and introduced by 3D Systems, Inc. based on the work of inventor Charles Hull.
There are more installations of stereolithography than any other RP technology. Stereolithography (STL) is a process for fabricating a solid plastic part out of a photosensitive
liquid polymer using a directed laser beam to solidify the polymer. The general setup for the
process is illustrated in Figure 33.2. Part fabrication is accomplished as a series of layers, in
which one layer is added onto the previous layer to gradually build the desired threedimensional geometry. A part fabricated by STL is illustrated in Figure 33.3.
The stereolithography apparatus consists of (1) a platform that can be moved
vertically inside a vessel containing the photosensitive polymer, and (2) a laser whose
beam can be controlled in the x-y direction. At the start of the process, the platform is
positioned vertically near the surface of the liquid photopolymer, and a laser beam is
directed through a curing path that comprises an area corresponding to the base (bottom
layer) of the part. This and subsequent curing paths are defined by the STI file (step 3 in
preparing the control instructions described in the preceding). The action of the laser is to
harden (cure) the photosensitive polymer where the beam strikes the liquid, forming a solid
layer of plastic that adheres to the platform. When the initial layer is completed, the platform
is lowered by a distance equal to the layer thickness, and a second layer is formed on top of
the first by the laser, and so on. Before each new layer is cured, a wiper blade is passed over
the viscous liquid resin to ensure that its level is the same throughout the surface. Each layer
consists of its own area shape, so that the succession of layers, one on top of the previous,
creates the solid part shape. Each layer is 0.076 to 0.50 mm (0.003 to 0.020 in) thick. Thinner
layers provide better resolution and allow more intricate part shapes; but processing time is

greater. Photopolymers are typically acrylic [13], although use of epoxy for STL has also
been reported [10]. The starting materials are liquid monomers. Polymerization occurs upon
exposure to ultraviolet light produced by helium-cadmium or argon ion lasers. Scan speeds
of STL lasers typically range between 500 and 2500 mm/s.
The time required to build the part by this layering process ranges from 1 hour for small
parts of simple geometry up to several dozen hours for complex parts. Other factors that
affect cycle time are scan speed and layer thickness. The part build time in stereolithography
can be estimated by determining the time to complete each layer and then summing the times
for all layers. First, the time to complete a single layer is given by the following equation:
Ti ¼

Ai
þ Tr
vD

ð33:1Þ

where Ti ¼ time to complete layer i, seconds, where the subscript i is used to identify the
layer; Ai ¼ area of layer i, mm2 (in2); v ¼ average scanning speed of the laser beam at the
surface, mm/s (in/sec); D ¼ diameter of the laser beam at the surface (called the ‘‘spot
size,’’ assumed circular), mm (in); and Tr ¼ repositioning time between layers, s.
In the case of stereolithography, the repositioning time involves lowering the
worktable in preparation for the next layer to be fabricated. Other RP techniques require
analogous repositioning steps between layers. The average scanning speed v must include
any effects of interruptions in the scanning path (e.g., because of gaps between areas of
the part in a given layer). Once the Ti values have been determined for all layers, then the
build cycle time can be determined:
nl
X
Tc ¼
Ti
ð33:2Þ
i¼1

where Tc ¼ the STL build cycle time, s; and nl ¼ the number of layers used to approximate
the part.3

Although these equations have been developed here for stereolithography, similar formulas can be
developed for the other RP material addition technologies discussed in this chapter, because they all use
the same layer-by-layer fabrication method.

After all of the layers have been formed, the photopolymer is about 95% cured.
The piece is therefore ‘‘baked’’ in a fluorescent oven to completely solidify the polymer.
Excess polymer is removed with alcohol, and light sanding is sometimes used to improve
smoothness and appearance.
Depending on its design and orientation, a part may contain overhanging features
that have no means of support during the bottom-up approach used in stereolithography.
For example, in the part of Figure 33.1, if the lower half of the handle and the lower
handlebar were eliminated, the upper portion of the handle would be unsupported during
fabrication. In these cases, extra pillars or webs may need to be added to the part simply for
support purposes. Otherwise, the overhangs may float away or otherwise distort the desired
part geometry. These extra features must be trimmed away after the process is completed.
Solid Ground Curing Like stereolithography, solid ground curing (SGC) works by curing
a photosensitive polymer layer by layer to create a solid model based on CAD geometric
data. Instead of using a scanning laser beam to accomplish the curing of a given layer, the
entire layer is exposed to an ultraviolet light source through a mask that is positioned
above the surface of the liquid polymer. The hardening process takes 2 to 3 seconds for
each layer. SGC systems are sold under the name Solider system by Cubital Ltd.
The starting data in SGC is similar to that used in stereolithography: a CAD
geometric model of the part that has been sliced into layers. For each layer, the stepby-step procedure in SGC is illustrated in Figure 33.4 and described here: (1) A mask is

created on a glass plate by electrostatically charging a negative image of the layer onto the
surface. The imaging technology is basically the same as that used in photocopiers. (2) A
thin flat layer of liquid photopolymer is distributed over the surface of the work platform.
(3) The mask is positioned above the liquid polymer surface and exposed by a highpowered (e.g., 2000 W) ultraviolet lamp. The portions of the liquid polymer layer that are
unprotected by the mask are solidified in about 2 seconds. The shaded areas of the layer
remain in the liquid state. (4) The mask is removed, the glass plate is cleaned and made
ready for a subsequent layer in step 1. Meanwhile, the liquid polymer remaining on the
surface is removed in a wiping and vacuuming procedure. (5) The now-open areas of the
layer are filled in with hot wax. When hardened, the wax acts to support overhanging
sections of the part. (6) When the wax has cooled and solidified, the polymer-wax surface is
milled to form a flat layer of specified thickness, ready to receive the next application of
liquid photopolymer in step 2. Although we have described SGC as a sequential process,
certain steps are accomplished in parallel. Specifically, the mask preparation step 1 for the
next layer is performed simultaneously with the layer fabrication steps 2 through 6, using
two glass plates during alternating layers.
The sequence for each layer takes about 90 seconds. Throughput time to produce a
part by SGC is claimed to be about eight times faster than competing RP systems [6]. The
solid cubic form created in SGC consists of solid polymer and wax. The wax provides support
for fragile and overhanging features of the part during fabrication, but can be melted away
later to leave the free-standing part. No post curing of the completed prototype model is
required, as in stereolithography.
Droplet Deposition Manufacturing These systems operate by melting the starting
material and shooting small droplets onto a previously formed layer. The liquid droplets
cold weld to the surface to form a new layer. The deposition of droplets for each new layer is
controlled by a moving x-y spray nozzle workhead whose path is based on a cross section of
a CAD geometric model that has been sliced into layers (similar to the other RP systems
described in the preceding). After each layer has been applied, the platform supporting the
part is lowered a certain distance corresponding to the layer thickness, in preparation for
the next layer. The term droplet deposition manufacturing (DDM) refers to the fact that
small particles of work material are deposited as projectile droplets from the workhead
nozzle.
Several commercial RP systems are based on this general operating principle, the
differences being in the type of material that is deposited and the corresponding
technique by which the workhead operates to melt and apply the material. An important
criterion that must be satisfied by the starting material is that it be readily melted and
solidified. Work materials used in DDM include wax and thermoplastics. Metals with low
melting point, such as tin, zinc, lead, and aluminum, have also been tested.
One of the more popular BPM systems is the Personal Modeler, available from BPM
Technology, Inc. Wax is commonly used as the work material. The ejector head operates
using a piezoelectric oscillator that shoots droplets of wax at a rate of 10,000 to 15,000 per
second. The droplets are of uniform size at about 0.076 mm (0.003 in) diameter, which
flatten to about 0.05-mm (0.002-in) solidified thickness on impact against the existing part
surface. After each layer has been deposited, the surface is milled or thermally smoothed
to achieve accuracy in the z-direction. Layer thickness is about 0.09 mm (0.0035 in).

33.2.2 SOLID-BASED RAPID PROTOTYPING SYSTEMS
The common feature in these RP systems is that the starting material is solid. In this
section we discuss two solid-based RP systems: (1) laminated-object manufacturing and
(2) fused-deposition modeling.

Laminated-Object Manufacturing The principal company offering laminated-object
manufacturing (LOM) systems is Helisys, Inc. Of interest is that much of the early
research and development work on LOM was funded by National Science Foundation.
The first commercial LOM unit was shipped in 1991.
Laminated-object manufacturing produces a solid physical model by stacking layers of
sheet stock that are each cut to an outline corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of a
CAD model that has been sliced into layers. The layers are bonded one on top of the previous
one before cutting. After cutting, the excess material in the layer remains in place to support
the part during building. Starting material in LOM can be virtually any material in sheet stock
form, such as paper, plastic, cellulose, metals, or fiber-reinforced materials. Stock thickness is
0.05 to 0.50 mm (0.002 to 0.020 in). In LOM, the sheet material is usually supplied with
adhesive backing as rolls that are spooled between two reels, as in Figure 33.5. Otherwise, the
LOM process must include an adhesive coating step for each layer.
The data preparation phase in LOM consists of slicing the geometric model using the
STL file for the given part. The slicing function is accomplished by LOMSliceTM, the special
software used in laminated-object manufacturing. Slicing the STL model in LOM is
performed after each layer has been physically completed and the vertical height of the
part has been measured. This provides a feedback correction to account for the actual
thickness of the sheet stock being used, a feature unavailable on most other RP systems.
With reference to Figure 33.5, the LOM process for each layer can be described as
follows, picking up the action with a sheet of stock in place and bonded to the previous
stack: (1) LOMSliceTM computes the cross-sectional perimeter of the STL model based
on the measured height of the physical part at the current layer of completion. (2) A laser
beam is used to cut along the perimeter, as well as to crosshatch the exterior portions of the
sheet for subsequent removal. The laser is typically a 25 or 50 W CO2 laser. The cutting
trajectory is controlled by means of an x-y positioning system. The cutting depth is
controlled so that only the top layer is cut. (3) The platform holding the stack is lowered,
and the sheet stock is advanced between supply roll and take-up spool for the next layer.
The platform is then raised to a height consistent with the stock thickness and a heated
roller moves across the new layer to bond it to the previous layer. The height of the physical
stack is measured in preparation for the next slicing computation by LOMSliceTM.
When all of the layers are completed, the new part is separated from the excess
external material using a hammer, putty knife, and wood carving tools. The part can then

E1C33

Chapter 33/Rapid Prototyping

be sanded to smooth and blend the layer edges. A sealing application is recommended,
using a urethane, epoxy, or other polymer spray to prevent moisture absorption and
damage. LOM part sizes can be relatively large among RP processes, with work volumes
up to 800 mm  500 mm by 550 mm (32 in  20 in  22 in). More common work volumes
are 380 mm  250 mm  350 mm (15 in  10 in  14 in).
Several low-cost systems based on the LOM build method are available. For
example, the JP System 5, available from Schroff Development Corporation, uses a
mechanical knife rather than a laser to cut the sheet stock for each layer. This system is
intended as a teaching tool and requires manual assembly of the layers.
Fused-Deposition Modeling Fused-deposition modeling (FDM) is an RP process in
which a filament of wax or polymer is extruded onto the existing part surface from a
workhead to complete each new layer. The workhead is controlled in the x-y plane during
each layer and then moves up by a distance equal to one layer in the z-direction. The
starting material is a solid filament with typical diameter ¼ 1.25 mm (0.050 in) fed from a
spool into the workhead that heats the material to about 0.5 C (1 F) above its melting point
before extruding it onto the part surface. The extrudate is solidified and cold welded to the
cooler part surface in about 0.1 second. The part is fabricated from the base up, using a
layer-by-layer procedure similar to other RP systems.
FDM was developed by Stratasys Inc., which sold its first machine in 1990. The
starting data is a CAD geometric model that is processed by Stratasys’s software modules
QuickSlice; and SupportWorkTM. QuickSlice; is used to slice the model into layers, and
SupportWorkTM is used to generate any support structures that are required during the
build process. If supports are needed, a dual extrusion head and a different material is used
to create the supports. The second material is designed to readily be separated from the
primary modeling material. The slice (layer) thickness can be set anywhere from 0.05 to
0.75 mm (0.002 to 0.030 in). About 400 mm of filament material can be deposited per second
by the extrusion workhead in widths (called the road width) that can be set between 0.25
and 2.5 mm (0.010 to 0.100 in). Starting materials are wax and several polymers, including
ABS, polyamide, polyethylene, and polypropylene. These materials are nontoxic, allowing
the FDM machine to be set up in an office environment.

33.2.3 POWDER-BASED RAPID PROTOTYPING SYSTEMS
The common feature of the RP technologies described in this section is that the starting
material is powder.4 We discuss two RP systems in this category: (1) selective laser
sintering and (2) three-dimensional printing.
Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) uses a moving laser beam to
sinter heat-fusible powders in areas corresponding to the CAD geometric model one layer
at a time to build the solid part. After each layer is completed, a new layer of loose powders
is spread across the surface using a counter-rotating roller. The powders are preheated to
just below their melting point to facilitate bonding and reduce distortion. Layer by layer,
the powders are gradually bonded into a solid mass that forms the three-dimensional part
geometry. In areas not sintered by the laser beam, the powders remain loose so they can be
poured out of the completed part. Meanwhile, they serve to support the solid regions of the
part as fabrication proceeds. Layer thickness is 0.075 to 0.50 mm (0.003 to 0.020 in).
SLS was developed at the University of Texas (Austin) as an alternative to stereolithography, and SLS machines are currently marketed by DTM Corp. It is a more versatile
process than stereolithography in terms of possible work materials. Current materials used

The definition, characteristics, and production of powders are described in Chapters 16 and 17.

in selective laser sintering include polyvinylchloride, polycarbonate, polyester, polyurethane, ABS, nylon, and investment casting wax. These materials are less expensive
than the photosensitive resins used in stereolithography. They are also nontoxic and can be
sintered using low power (25 to 50 W) CO2 lasers. Metal and ceramic powders are also being
used in SLS.
Three-Dimensional Printing This RP technology was developed at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) builds the part in the usual
layer-by-layer fashion using an ink-jet printer to eject an adhesive bonding material onto
successive layers of powders. The binder is deposited in areas corresponding to the cross
sections of the solid part, as determined by slicing the CAD geometric model into layers.
The binder holds the powders together to form the solid part, while the unbonded
powders remain loose to be removed later. While the loose powders are in place during
the build process, they provide support for overhanging and fragile features of the part.
When the build process is completed, the part is heat treated to strengthen the bonding,
followed by removal of the loose powders. To further strengthen the part, a sintering step
can be applied to bond the individual powders.
The part is built on a platform whose level is controlled by a piston. Let us describe the
process for one cross section with reference to Figure 33.6: (1) A layer of powder is spread
on the existing part-in-process. (2) An ink-jet printing head moves across the surface,
ejecting droplets of binder on those regions that are to become the solid part. (3) When the
printing of the current layer is completed, the piston lowers the platform for the next layer.
Starting materials in 3DP are powders of ceramic, metal, or cermet, and binders
that are polymeric or colloidal silica or silicon carbide [10], [13]. Typical layer thickness
ranges from 0.10 to 0.18 mm (0.004 to 0.007 in). The ink-jet printing head moves across
the layer at a speed of about 1.5 m/s (59 in/sec), with ejection of liquid binder determined
during the sweep by raster scanning. The sweep time, together with the spreading of the
powders, permits a cycle time per layer of about 2 seconds [13].

33.3

APPLICATION ISSUES IN RAPID PROTOTYPING
Applications of rapid prototyping can be classified into three categories: (1) design,
(2) engineering analysis and planning, and (3) tooling and manufacturing.

Chapter 33/Rapid Prototyping

Design This was the initial application area for RP systems. Designers are able to confirm
their design by building a real physical model in minimum time using rapid prototyping. The
features and functions of the part can be communicated to others more easily using a
physical model than by a paper drawing or displaying it on a CAD system monitor. Benefits
to design attributed to rapid prototyping include [2]: (1) reduced lead times to produce
prototype components, (2) improved ability to visualize the part geometry because of its
physical existence, (3) earlier detection and reduction of design errors, and (4) increased
capability to compute mass properties of components and assemblies.
Engineering Analysis and Planning The existence of an RP-fabricated part allows for
certain types of engineering analysis and planning activities to be accomplished that would
be more difficult without the physical entity. Some of the possibilities are (1) comparison of
different shapes and styles to optimize aesthetic appeal of the part; (2) analysis of fluid flow
through different orifice designs in valves fabricated by RP; (3) wind tunnel testing of
different streamline shapes using physical models created by RP; (4) stress analysis of a
physical model; (5) fabrication of preproduction parts by RP as an aid in process planning
and tool design; and (6) combining medical imaging technologies, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), with RP to create models for doctors in planning surgical
procedures or fabricating prostheses or implants.
Tooling and Manufacturing The trend in RP applications is toward its greater use in the
fabrication of production tooling and for actual manufacture of parts. When RP is adopted
to fabricate production tooling, the term rapid tool making (RTM) is often used. RTM
applications divide into two approaches [4]: indirect RTM method, in which a pattern is
created by RP and the pattern is used to fabricate the tool, and direct RTM method, in
which RP is used to make the tool itself. Examples of indirect RTM include (1) use of an RPfabricated part as the master in making a silicon rubber mold that is subsequently used as a
production mold, (2) RP patterns to make the sand molds in sand casting (Section 11.1),
(3) fabrication of patterns of low-melting point materials (e.g., wax) in limited quantities
for investment casting (Section 11.2.4), and (4) making electrodes for EDM (Section 26.3.1)
[6], [10]. Examples of direct RTM include: (1) RP-fabricated mold cavity inserts that can
be sprayed with metal to produce injection molds for a limited quantity of production
plastic parts (Section 13.6) and (2) 3-D printing to create a die geometry in metallic
powders followed by sintering and infiltration to complete the fabrication of the die [4],
[6], [10].
Examples of actual part production include [10]: (1) small batch sizes of plastic
parts that could not be economically injection molded because of the high cost of the
mold, (2) parts with intricate internal geometries that could not be made using conventional technologies without assembly, and (3) one-of-a-kind parts such as bone replacements that must be made to correct size for each user.
Not all RP technologies can be used for all of these tooling and manufacturing
examples. Interested readers should consult more complete treatments of the RP
technologies for specific details on these and other examples.
Problems with Rapid Prototyping The principal problems with current RP technologies include (1) part accuracy, (2) limited variety of materials, and (3) mechanical
performance of the fabricated parts.
Several sources of error limit part accuracy in RP systems: (1) mathematical,
(2) process related, or (3) material related [13]. Mathematical errors include approximations of part surfaces used in RP data preparation and differences between the slicing
thicknesses and actual layer thicknesses in the physical part. The latter differences result in
z-axis dimensional errors. An inherent limitation in the physical part is the steps between
layers, especially as layer thickness is increased, resulting in a staircase appearance for

sloping part surfaces. Process-related errors are those that result from the particular part
building technology used in the RP system. These errors degrade the shape of each layer as
well as the registration between adjacent layers. Process errors can also affect the z-axis
dimension. Finally, material-related errors include shrinkage and distortion. An allowance for shrinkage can be made by enlarging the CAD model of the part based on previous
experience with the process and materials.
Current rapid prototyping systems are limited in the variety of materials they can
process. For example, the most common RP technology, stereolithography, is limited to
photosensitive polymers. In general, the materials used in RP systems are not as strong as
the production part materials that will be used in the actual product. This limits the
mechanical performance of the prototypes and the amount of realistic testing that can be
done to verify the design during product development.

An integrated circuit (IC) is a collection of electronic devices
such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been
fabricated and electrically intraconnected onto a small flat
chip of semiconductor material. The IC was invented in 1959
and has been the subject of continual development ever since
(Historical Note 34.1). Silicon (Si) is the most widely used
semiconductor material for ICs, because of its combination
of properties and low cost. Less common semiconductor
chips are made of germanium (Ge) and gallium arsenide
(GaAs). Because the circuits are fabricated into one solid
piece of material, the term solid-state electronics is used to
denote these devices.
The most fascinating aspect of microelectronics technology is the huge number of devices that can be packed onto
a single small chip. Various terms have been developed to
define the level of integration and density of packing, such as
large-scale integration (LSI) and very-large-scale integration (VLSI). Table 34.1 lists these terms, their definitions
(although there is not complete agreement over the dividing
lines between levels), and the period during which the
technology was or is being introduced.

34.1

OVERVIEW OF IC
PROCESSING

Structurally, an integrated circuit consists of hundreds, thousands, or millions of microscopic electronic devices that have
been fabricated and electrically intraconnected within the
surface of a silicon chip. A chip, also called a die, is a square
or rectangular flat plate that is about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) thick
and typically 5 to 25 mm (0.200 to 1.0 in) on a side. Each
electronic device (i.e., transistor, diode, etc.) on the chip
surface consists of separate layers and regions with different
electrical properties combined to perform the particular

he history of integrated circuits includes inventions of
electronic devices and the processes for making these
devices. The development of radar immediately before
World War II (1939 to 1945) identified germanium and
silicon as important semiconductor elements for the
diodes used in radar circuitry. Owing to the importance
of radar in the war, commercial sources of germanium
and silicon were developed.
In 1947, the transistor was developed at the Bell
Telephone Laboratories by J. Bardeen and W. Brattain. An
improved version was subsequently invented by W.
Shockley of Bell Labs in 1952. These three inventors shared
the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their research on
semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor. The
interest of the Bell Labs was to develop electronic switching
systems that were more reliable than the electromechanical
relays and vacuum tubes used at that time.
In February 1959, J. Kilby of Texas Instruments Inc.
filed a patent application for the fabrication of multiple
electronic devices and their intraconnection to form a
circuit on a single piece of semiconductor material. Kilby
was describing an integrated circuit (IC). In May 1959,
J. Hoerni of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. applied for a
patent describing the planar process for fabricating
transistors. In July of the same year, R. Noyce also of
Fairchild filed a patent application similar to the Kilby

invention but specifying the use of planar technology and
adherent leads.
Although filed later than Kilby’s, Noyce’s patent was
issued first, in 1961 (the Kilby patent was awarded in
1964). This discrepancy in dates and similarity in
inventions have resulted in considerable controversy
over who was really the inventor of the IC. The issue was
argued in legal suits stretching all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court. The high court refused to hear the case,
leaving stand a lower court ruling that favored several of
Noyce’s claims. The result (at the risk of oversimplifying)
is that Kilby is generally credited with the concept of the
monolithic integrated circuit, whereas Noyce is credited
with the method for fabricating it.
The first commercial ICs were introduced by Texas
Instruments in March 1960. Early integrated circuits
contained about 10 devices on a small silicon chip—
about 3 mm (0.12 in) square. By 1966, silicon had
overtaken germanium as the preferred semiconductor
material. Since that year, Si has been the predominant
material in IC fabrication. Since the 1960s, a continual
trend toward miniaturization and increased integration
of multiple devices in a single chip has occurred in the
electronics industry (the progress can be seen in Table
34.1), leading to the components described in this
chapter.

electronic function of the device. A typical cross section of such a MOSFET1 device is
illustrated in Figure 34.1. The devices are electrically connected to one another by very fine
lines of conducting material, usually aluminum, so that the intraconnected devices (that is,
the integrated circuit) function in the specified way. Conducting lines and pads are also

MOSFET stands for Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor. A transistor is a semiconductor device capable of performing various functions such as amplifying, controlling, or generating
electrical signals. A field-effect transistor is one in which current flows between source and drain regions
through a channel, the flow depending on the application of voltage to the channel gate. A metal-oxidesemiconductor FET uses silicon dioxide to separate the channel and gate metallization.

provided to electrically connect the IC to leads, which in turn permit the IC to be connected
to external circuits.
To allow the IC to be connected to the outside world, and to protect it from damage, the
chip is attached to a lead frame and encapsulated inside a suitable package, as in Figure 34.2.
The package is an enclosure, usually made of plastic or ceramic, which provides mechanical
and environmental protection for the chip and includes leads by which the IC can be
electrically connected to external circuits. The leads are attached to conducting pads on the
chip that access the IC.

34.1.1 PROCESSING SEQUENCE
The sequence to fabricate a silicon-based IC chip begins with the processing of silicon
(Section 7.5.2). Briefly, silicon of very high purity is reduced in several steps from sand
(silicon dioxide, SiO2). The silicon is grown from a melt into a large solid single crystal log,
with typical length of 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) and diameter up to 300 mm (12 in). The log, called a
boule, is then sliced into thin wafers, which are disks of thickness equal to about 0.5 mm
(0.020 in).
After suitable finishing and cleaning, the wafers are ready for the sequence of processes
by which microscopic features of various chemistries will be created in their surface to form
the electronic devices and their intraconnections. The sequence consists of several types of
processes, most of them repeated many times. A total of 200 or more processing steps may be
required to produce a modern IC. Basically, the objective in the sequence is to add, alter,
or remove a layer of material in selected regions of the wafer surface. The layering steps in
IC fabrication are sometimes referred to as the planar process, because the processing
relies on the geometric form of the silicon wafer being a plane. The processes by which the
layers are added include thin film deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition

and chemical vapor deposition (Section 28.5), and existing layers are altered by diffusion and
ion implantation (Section 28.2). Additional layer-forming techniques, such as thermal
oxidation, are also employed. Layers are removed in selected regions by etching, using
chemical etchants (usually acid solutions) and other more advanced technologies such as
plasma etching.
The addition, alteration, and removal of layers must be done selectively; that is, only in
certain extremely small regions of the wafer surface to create the device details such as in
Figure 34.1. To distinguish which regions will be affected in each processing step, a
procedure involving lithography is used. In this technique, masks are formed on the surface
to protect certain areas and allow other areas to be exposed to the particular process (e.g.,
film deposition, etching). By repeating the steps many times, exposing different areas in
each step, the starting silicon wafer is gradually transformed into many integrated circuits.
Processing of the wafer is organized in such a way that many individual chip
surfaces are formed on a single wafer. Because the wafer is round with diameters ranging
from 150 to 300 mm (6 to 12 in), whereas the final chip may only be 12 mm (0.5 in) square,
it is possible to produce hundreds of chips on a single wafer. At the conclusion of planar
processing, each IC on the wafer is visually and functionally tested, the wafer is diced into
individual chips, and each chip that passes the quality test is packaged as in Figure 34.2.
Summarizing the preceding discussion, the production of silicon-based integrated
circuits consists of the following stages, portrayed in Figure 34.3: (1) Silicon processing, in
which sand is reduced to very pure silicon and then shaped into wafers; (2) IC fabrication,
consisting of multiple processing steps that add, alter, and remove thin layers in selected
regions to form the electronic devices; lithography is used to define the regions to be
processed on the surface of the wafer; and (3) IC packaging, in which the wafer is tested, cut
into individual dies (IC chips), and the dies are encapsulated in an appropriate package.
The presentation in subsequent sections of our chapter is concerned with the details of
these processing stages. Section 34.2 deals with silicon processing. Section 34.3 discusses
lithography and Section 34.3 examines the processes used in conjunction with lithography to
add, alter, or remove layers. We consider an example of IC fabrication in Section 34.5. Section
34.6 describes die cutting and packaging of the chips. Finally, Section 34.7 covers yield
analysis in IC fabrication.
Before beginning our coverage of the processing details, it is important to note that the
microscopic dimensions of the devices in integrated circuits impose special requirements on
the environment in which IC fabrication is accomplished.

Chapter 34/Processing of Integrated Circuits

34.1.2 CLEAN ROOMS
Much of the processing sequence for integrated circuits must be carried out in a clean
room, the ambiance of which is more like a hospital operating room than a production
factory. Cleanliness is dictated by the microscopic feature sizes in an IC, the scale of which
continues to decrease with each passing year. Figure 34.4 shows the trend in IC device
feature size; also displayed in the same figure are common airborne particles that are
potential contaminants in IC processing. These particles can cause defects in the integrated
circuits, reducing yields and increasing costs.
A clean room provides protection from these contaminants. The air is purified to
remove most of the particles from the processing environment; temperature and humidity
are also controlled. A standard classification system is used to specify the cleanliness of a
clean room. In the system, a number (in increments of ten) is used to indicate the quantity of
particles of size 0.5 mm or greater in one cubic foot of air.2 Thus, a class 100 clean room must
maintain a count of particles of size 0.5 mm or greater at less than 100/ft3. Modern VLSI
processing requires class 10 clean rooms, which means that the number of particles of size
equal to or greater than 0.5 mm is less than 10/ft3. The air in the clean room is air conditioned
to a temperature of 21 C (70 F) and 45% relative humidity. The air is passed through a
high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to capture particle contaminants.
Humans are the biggest source of contaminants in IC processing; emanating from
humans are bacteria, tobacco smoke, viruses, hair, and other particles. Human workers in
IC processing areas are required to wear special clothing, generally consisting of white
cloaks, gloves, and hair nets. Where extreme cleanliness is required, workers are completely
encased in bunny suits. Processing equipment is a second major source of contaminants;
machinery produces wear particles, oil, dirt, and similar contaminants. IC processing is
usually accomplished in laminar-flow hooded work areas, which can be purified to greater
levels of cleanliness than the general environment of the clean room.

In addition to the very pure atmosphere provided by the clean room, the chemicals
and water used in IC processing must be very clean and free of particles. Modern practice
requires that chemicals and water be filtered before use.

34.2

SILICON PROCESSING
Microelectronic chips are fabricated on a substrate of semiconductor material. Silicon is the
leading semiconductor material today, constituting more than 95% of all semiconductor
devices produced in the world. Our discussion in this introductory treatment will be limited
to Si. The preparation of the silicon substrate can be divided into three steps: (1) production
of electronic grade silicon, (2) crystal growing, and (3) shaping of Si into wafers.

34.2.1 PRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC GRADE SILICON
Silicon is one of the most abundant materials in the Earth’s crust (Table 7.1), occurring
naturally as silica (e.g., sand) and silicates (e.g., clay). Electronic grade silicon (EGS) is
polycrystalline silicon of ultra high purity—so pure that the impurities are in the range of parts
per billion (ppb). They cannot be measured by conventional chemical laboratory techniques
but must be inferred from measurements of resistivity on test ingots. The reduction of the
naturally occurring Si compound to EGS involves the following processing steps.
The first step is carried out in a submerged-electrode arc furnace. The principal raw
material for silicon is quartzite, which is very pure SiO2. The charge also includes coal,
coke, and wood chips as sources of carbon for the various chemical reactions that occur in
the furnace. The net product consists of metallurgical grade silicon (MGS), and the gases
SiO and CO. MGS is only about 98% Si, which is adequate for metallurgical alloying but
not for electronics components. The major impurities (making up the remaining 2% of
MGS) include aluminum, calcium, carbon, iron, and titanium.
The second step involves grinding the brittle MGS and reacting the Si powders with

Si þ 3HCl ðgasÞ ! SiHCl3 ðgasÞ þ H2 ðgasÞ

ð34:1Þ

The reaction is performed in a fluidized-bed reactor at temperatures around 300 C
(550 F). Trichlorsilane (SiHCl3), although shown as a gas in Eq. (34.1), is a liquid at room
temperature. Its low boiling point of 32 C (90 F) permits it to be separated from the
leftover impurities of MGS by fractional distillation.
The final step in the process is reduction of the purified trichlorsilane by means of
hydrogen gas. The process is carried out at temperatures up to 1000 C (1800 F), and a
simplified equation of the reaction can be written as follows:
SiHCl3 ðgasÞ þ H2 ðgasÞ ! Si þ 3HCl ðgasÞ

The product of this reaction is electronic grade silicon—nearly 100% pure Si.

34.2.2 CRYSTAL GROWING
The silicon substrate for microelectronic chips must be made of a single crystal whose unit
cell is oriented in a certain direction. The properties of the substrate and the way it is
processed are both influenced by these requirements. Accordingly, silicon used as the raw
material in semiconductor device fabrication must not only be of ultra high purity, as in

electronic grade silicon; it must also be prepared in the form of a single crystal and then cut
in a direction that achieves the desired planar orientation. The crystal-growing process is
covered here, whereas the next section details the cutting operation.
The most widely used crystal-growing method in the semiconductor industry is the
Czochralski process, illustrated in Figure 34.5, in which a single crystal ingot, called a boule,
is pulled upward from a pool of molten silicon. The setup includes a furnace, a mechanical
apparatus for pulling the boule, a vacuum system, and supporting controls. The furnace
consists of a crucible and heating system contained in a vacuum chamber. The crucible is
supported by a mechanism that permits rotation during the crystal-pulling procedure.
Chunks of EGS are placed in the crucible and heated to a temperature slightly above the
melting point of silicon: 1410 C (2570 F). Heating is by induction or resistance, the latter
being used for large melt sizes. The molten silicon is doped3 before boule pulling to make the
crystal either p-type or n-type.
To initiate crystal growing, a seed crystal of silicon is dipped into the molten pool and
then withdrawn upward under carefully controlled conditions. At first the pulling rate (vertical
velocity of the pulling apparatus) is relatively rapid, which causes a single crystal of silicon to
solidify against the seed, forming a thin neck. The velocity is then reduced, causing the neck to
grow into the desired larger diameter of the boule while maintaining its single crystal structure.
In addition to pulling rate, rotation of the crucible and other process parameters are used to
3

The term dope (doped, doping) refers to the introduction of impurities into the semiconductor material to
alter its electrical properties, making the semiconductor either an n-type (excess electrons in its structure)
or a p-type (missing electrons in its structure).

control boule size. Single-crystal ingots of diameter ¼ 300 mm (12 in) and up to 3 m (10 ft) long
are commonly produced for subsequent fabrication of microelectronic chips.
It is important to avoid contamination of the silicon during crystal growing, because
contaminants, even in small amounts, can dramatically alter the electrical properties of
Si. To minimize unwanted reactions with silicon and the introduction of contaminants at
the elevated temperatures of crystal growing, the procedure is carried out either in an
inert gas (argon or helium) or a vacuum. Choice of crucible material is also important;
fused silica (SiO2), although not perfect for the application, represents the best available
material and is used almost exclusively. Gradual dissolution of the crucible introduces
oxygen as an unintentional impurity in the silicon boule. Unfortunately, the level of
oxygen in the melt increases during the process, leading to a variation in concentration of
the impurity throughout the length and diameter of the ingot.

34.2.3 SHAPING OF SILICON INTO WAFERS
Aseries ofprocessingstepsareusedtoreducethebouleintothin,disc-shapedwafers.Thesteps
can be grouped as follows: (1) ingot preparation, (2) wafer slicing, and (3) wafer preparation.
In ingot preparation, the seed and tang ends of the ingot are first cut off, as well as portions of
the ingot that do not meet the strict resistivity and crystallographic requirements for
subsequent IC processing. Next, a form of cylindrical grinding, as shown in Figure 34.6(a), is
used to shape the ingot into a more perfect cylinder, because the crystal-growing process
cannot achieve sufficient control over diameter and roundness. One or more flats are then
ground along the length of the ingot, as in Figure 34.6(b). After the wafers have been cut
from the ingot, these flats serve several functions: (1) identification, (2) orientation of the
ICs relative to crystal structure, and (3) mechanical location during processing.
The ingot is now ready to be sliced into wafers, using the abrasive cutoff process
illustrated in Figure 34.7. A very thin saw blade with diamond grit bonded to the internal
diameter serves as the cutting edge. Use of the ID for slicing rather than the OD of the saw
blade provides better control over flatness, thickness, parallelism, and surface characteristics
of the wafer. The wafers are cut to a thickness of around 0.5 to 0.7 mm (0.020 to 0.028 in),

depending on diameter (greater thicknesses for larger wafer diameters). For every wafer
cut, a certain amount of silicon is wasted because of the kerf width of the saw blade. To
minimize kerf loss, the blades are made as thin as possible—around 0.33 mm (0.013 in).
Next the wafer must be prepared for the subsequent processes and handling in IC
fabrication. After slicing, the rims of the wafers are rounded using a contour-grinding
operation, such as in Figure 34.8(a). This reduces chipping of the wafer edges during
handling and minimizes accumulation of photoresist solutions at the wafer rims. The wafers
are then chemically etched to remove surface damage that occurred during slicing. This is
followed by a flat polishing operation to provide very smooth surfaces that will accept the
subsequent photolithography processes. The polishing step, seen in Figure 34.8(b), uses a
slurry of very fine silica (SiO2) particles in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide
(NaOH). The NaOH oxidizes the Si wafer surface, and the abrasive particles remove the
oxidized surface layers—about 0.025 mm (0.001 in) is removed from each side during
polishing. Finally, the wafer is chemically cleaned to remove residues and organic films.
It is of interest to know how many IC chips can be fabricated on a wafer of a given size.
The number depends on the chip size relative to the wafer size. Assuming that the chips are
square, the following equation can be used to estimate the number of chips on the wafer:
 2:25
Dw
nc ¼ 0:34
Lc

ð34:3Þ

where nc ¼ estimated number of chips on the wafer; Dw ¼ diameter of the processable area of
the wafer, assumed circular, mm (in); and Lc ¼ side dimension of the chip, assumed square,
mm (in).

The diameter of the processable area of the wafer will be slightly less than the outside
diameter of the wafer. The actual number of chips on the wafer may be different from the
value given by Eq. (34.3), depending on the way the chips are laid out on the wafer.

34.3

LITHOGRAPHY
An IC consists of many microscopic regions on the wafer surface that make up the
transistors, other devices, and intraconnections in the circuit design. In the planar process,
the regions are fabricated by a sequence of steps to add layers to selected areas of the
surface. The form of each layer is determined by a geometric pattern representing circuit
design information that is transferred to the wafer surface by a procedure known as
lithography—basically the same procedure used by artists and printers for centuries.
Several lithographic technologies are used in semiconductor processing: (1) photolithography, (2) electron lithography, (3) x-ray lithography, and (4) ion lithography. As
their names indicate, the differences are in the type of radiation used to transfer the mask
pattern to the surface by exposing the photoresist. The traditional technique is photolithography, and most of our discussion will be directed at this topic. The reader may
recall that photolithography is used in some chemical machining processes (Section 26.4).

34.3.1 PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY
Photolithography, also known as optical lithography, uses light radiation to expose a coating
of photoresist on the surface of the silicon wafer; a mask containing the required geometric
pattern for each layer separates the light source from the wafer, so that only the portions of
the photoresist not blocked by the mask are exposed. The mask consists of a flat plate of
transparent glass onto which a thin film of an opaque substance has been deposited in certain
areas to form the desired pattern. Thickness of the glass plate is around 2 mm (0.080 in),
whereas the deposited film is only a few mm thick—for some film materials, less than 1 mm.
The mask itself is fabricated by lithography, the pattern being based on circuit design data,
usually in the form of digital output from the CAD system used by the circuit designer.
Photoresists A photoresist is an organic polymer that is sensitive to light radiation in a
certain wavelength range; the sensitivity causes either an increase or decrease in solubility of
the polymer to certain chemicals. Typical practice in semiconductor processing is to use
photoresists that are sensitive to ultraviolet light. UV light has a short wavelength compared
with visible light, permitting sharper imaging of microscopic circuit details on the wafer
surface. It also permits the fabrication and photoresist areas in the plant to be illuminated at
low light levels outside the UV band.
Two types of photoresists are available: positive and negative. A positive resist becomes
more soluble in developing solutions after exposure to light. A negative resist becomes less
soluble (the polymer cross–links and hardens) when exposed to light. Figure 34.9 illustrates
the operation of both resist types. Negative resists have better adhesion to SiO2 and metal
surfaces and good etch resistance. However, positive resists achieve better resolution, which
has made it the more widely used technique as IC feature sizes have become smaller and
smaller.
Exposure Techniques The resists are exposed through the mask by one of three exposure
techniques: (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing, and (c) projection printing,
illustrated in Figure 34.10. In contact printing, the mask is pressed against the resist
coating during exposure. This results in high resolution of the pattern onto the wafer

surface; an important disadvantage is that physical contact with the wafers gradually wears
out the mask. In proximity printing, the mask is separated from the resist coating by a
distance of 10 to 25 mm (0.0004 to 0.001 in). This eliminates mask wear, but resolution of the
image is slightly reduced. Projection printing involves the use of a high-quality lens (or
mirror) system to project the image through the mask onto the wafer. This has become the
preferred technique because it is noncontact (thus, no mask wear), and the mask pattern
can be reduced through optical projection to obtain high resolution.

Processing Sequence in Photolithography Let us examine a typical processing
sequence for a silicon wafer in which photolithography is employed. The surface of the
silicon has been oxidized to form a thin film of SiO2 on the wafer. It is desired to remove the
SiO2 film in certain regions as defined by the mask pattern. The sequence for a positive
resist proceeds as follows, illustrated in Figure 34.11. (1) Prepare surface. The wafer is
properly cleaned to promote wetting and adhesion of the resist. (2) Apply photoresist. In
semiconductor processing, photoresists are applied by feeding a metered amount of liquid
resist onto the center of the wafer and then spinning the wafer to spread the liquid and
achieve a uniform coating thickness. Desired thickness is around 1 mm (0.00004 in), which
gives good resolution yet minimizes pinhole defects. (3) Soft-bake. Purpose of this preexposure bake is to remove solvents, promote adhesion, and harden the resist. Typical
soft-bake temperatures are around 90 C (190 F) for 10 to 20 min. (4) Align mask and
expose. The pattern mask is aligned relative to the wafer and the resist is exposed through
the mask by one of the methods described in the preceding. Alignment must be
accomplished with very high precision, using optical-mechanical equipment designed
specifically for the purpose. If the wafer has been previously processed by lithography so
that a pattern has already been formed in the wafer, then subsequent masks must be
accurately registered relative to the existing pattern. Exposure of the resist depends on the
same basic rule as in photography—the exposure is a function of light intensity  time. A
mercury arc lamp or other source of UV light is used. (5) Develop resist. The exposed
wafer is next immersed in a developing solution, or the solution is sprayed onto the wafer
surface. For the positive resist in our example, the exposed areas are dissolved in the
developer, thus leaving the SiO2 surface uncovered in these areas. Development is usually
followed by a rinse to stop development and remove residual chemicals. (6) Hard-bake.
This baking step expels volatiles remaining from the developing solution and increases
adhesion of the resist, especially at the newly created edges of the resist film. (7) Etch.
Etching removes the SiO2 layer at selected regions where the resist has been removed.
(8) Strip resist. After etching, the resist coating that remains on the surface must be
removed. Stripping is accomplished using either wet or dry techniques. Wet stripping uses
liquid chemicals; a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4–H2O2) is
common. Dry stripping uses plasma etching with oxygen as the reactive gas.
Although our example describes the use of photolithography to remove a thin film
of SiO2 from a silicon substrate, the same basic procedure is followed for other processing

E1C34

Chapter 34/Processing of Integrated Circuits

steps. The purpose of photolithography in all of these steps is to expose specific regions
beneath the photoresist layer so that the process can be performed on these exposed
regions. In the processing of a given wafer, photolithography is repeated as many times as
needed to produce the desired integrated circuit, each time using a different mask to
define the appropriate pattern.

34.3.2 OTHER LITHOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES
As feature size in integrated circuits continues to decrease and conventional UV photolithography becomes increasingly inadequate, other lithography techniques that offer
higher resolution are growing in importance. These techniques are extreme ultraviolet
lithography, electron beam lithography, x-ray lithography, and ion lithography. In the
following paragraphs, we provide brief descriptions of these alternatives. For each technique, special resist materials are required that react to the particular type of radiation.
Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) represents a refinement of conventional UV
lithography through the use of shorter wavelengths during exposure. The ultraviolet wavelength spectrum ranges from about 10 nm to 380 nm (nm ¼ nanometer ¼ 109 m), the upper
end of which is close to the visible light range (approximately 400 to 700 nm wavelengths).
EUV technology permits the feature size of an integrated circuit to be reduced to at about
0.04 mm, compared with about 0.1 mm with conventional UV exposure.
Compared with UV and EUV lithography, electron-beam (E-Beam) lithography
virtually eliminates diffraction during exposure of the resist, thus permitting higher
resolution of the image. Another potential advantage is that a scanning E-beam can be
directed to expose only certain regions of the wafer surface, thus eliminating the need for a
mask. Unfortunately, high-quality electron-beam systems are expensive. Also, because of
the time-consuming sequential nature of the exposure method, production rates are low
compared with the mask techniques of optical lithography. Accordingly, use of E-beam
lithography tends to be limited to small production quantities. E-beam techniques are
widely used for making the masks in UV lithography.
X-ray lithography has been under development since around 1972. As in E-beam
lithography, the wavelengths of X-rays are much shorter than UV light (x-ray wavelength
ranges from 0.005 nm to several dozen nm, overlapping the lower end of the UV range).
Thus, they hold the promise of sharper imaging during exposure of the resist. X-rays are
difficult to focus during lithography. Consequently, contact or proximity printing must be
used, and a small x-ray source must be used at a relatively large distance from the wafer
surface to achieve good image resolution through the mask.
Ion lithography systems divide into two categories: (1) focused ion beam systems,
whose operation is similar to a scanning E-beam system and avoids the need for a mask;
and (2) masked ion beam systems, which expose the resist through a mask by proximity
printing. As with E-beam and x-ray systems, ion lithography produces higher image
resolution than conventional UV photolithography.

34.4 LAYER PROCESSES USED IN IC FABRICATION
The steps required to produce an integrated circuit consist of chemical and physical
processes that add, alter, or remove regions on the silicon wafer that have been defined
by photolithography. These regions constitute the insulating, semiconducting, and conducting areas that form the devices and their intraconnections in the integrated circuits. The
layers are fabricated one at a time, step by step, each layer having a different configuration
and each requiring a separate photolithography mask, until all of the microscopic details of
the electronic devices and conducting paths have been constructed on the wafer surface.

Section 34.4/Layer Processes Used in IC Fabrication

813

In this section we consider the wafer processes used to add, alter, and subtract layers.
Processes that add or alter layers to the surface include (1) thermal oxidation, used to grow
a layer of silicon dioxide onto the silicon substrate; (2) chemical vapor deposition, a
versatile process used to apply various types of layers in IC fabrication; (3) diffusion and ion
implantation, used to alter the chemistry of an existing layer or substrate; and (4) various
metallization processes that add metal layers to provide regions of electrical conduction on
the wafer. Finally (5), several etching processes are used to remove portions of the layers
that have been added to achieve the desired details of the integrated circuit.

34.4.1 THERMAL OXIDATION
Oxidation of the silicon wafer may be performed multiple times during fabrication of an
integrated circuit. Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is an insulator, contrasted with the semiconducting
properties of Si. The ease with which a thin film of SiO2 can be produced on the surface of a
silicon wafer is one of the attractive features of silicon as a semiconductor material.
Silicon dioxide serves a number of important functions in IC fabrication: (1) It is
used as a mask to prevent diffusion or ion implantation of dopants into silicon. (2) It can
be used to isolate devices in the circuit. (3) It provides electrical insulation between levels
in multilevel metallization systems.
Several processes are used to form SiO2 in semiconductor manufacturing, depending on when during chip fabrication the oxide must be added. The most common process
is thermal oxidation, appropriate for growing SiO2 films on silicon substrates. In thermal
oxidation, the wafer is exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere at elevated temperature;
either oxygen or steam atmospheres are used, with the following reactions, respectively:
Si þ O2 ! SiO2

ð34:4Þ

Si þ 2H2 O ! SiO2 þ 2H2

ð34:5Þ

or

Typical temperatures used in thermal oxidation of silicon range from 900 C to 1300 C
(1650 F to 2350 F). By controlling temperature and time, oxide films of predictable
thicknesses can be obtained. The equations show that silicon at the surface of the wafer
is consumed in the reaction, as seen in Figure 34.12. To grow a SiO2 film of thickness d
requires a layer of silicon that is 0.44d thick.
When a silicon dioxide film must be applied to surfaces other than silicon, then direct
thermal oxidation is not appropriate. An alternative process must be used, such as chemical
vapor deposition.

34.4.2 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) involves growth of a thin film on the surface of a heated
substrate by chemical reactions or decomposition of gases (Section 28.5.2). CVD is widely

Chapter 34/Processing of Integrated Circuits

used in the processing of integrated circuit wafers to add layers of silicon dioxide, silicon
nitride (Si3N4), and silicon. Plasma-enhanced CVD is often used because it permits the
reactions to take place at lower temperatures.
Typical CVD Reactions in IC Fabrication In the case of silicon dioxide, if the surface of
the wafer is only silicon (e.g., at the start of IC fabrication), then thermal oxidation is the
appropriate process by which to form a layer of SiO2. If the oxide layer must be grown over
materials other than silicon, such as aluminum or silicon nitride, then some alternative
technique must be used, such as CVD. Chemical vapor deposition of SiO2 is accomplished
by reacting a silicon compound such as silane (SiH4) with oxygen onto a heated substrate.
The reaction is carried out at around 425 C (800 F) and can be summarized by
SiH4 þ O2 ! SiO2 þ 2H2

ð34:6Þ

The density of the silicon dioxide film and its bonding to the substrate is generally
poorer than that achieved by thermal oxidation. Consequently, CVD is used only when the
preferred process is not feasible; that is, when the substrate surface is not silicon, or when
the high temperatures used in thermal oxidation cannot be tolerated. CVD can be used to
deposit layers of doped SiO2, such as phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide (called P-glass).
Silicon nitride is used as a masking layer during oxidation of silicon. Si3N4 has a low
oxidation rate compared with Si, so a nitride mask can be used to prevent oxidation in
coated areas on the silicon surface. Silicon nitride is also used as a passivation layer
(protecting against sodium diffusion and moisture). A conventional CVD process for
coating Si3N4 onto a silicon wafer involves reaction of silane and ammonia (NH3) at around
800 C (1500 F) as follows:
3SiH4 þ 4NH3 ! Si3 N4 þ 12H2

ð34:7Þ

Plasma-enhanced CVD is also used for basically the same coating reaction, the advantage
being that it can be performed at much lower temperatures—around 300 C (600 F).
Polycrystalline silicon (called polysilicon to distinguish it from silicon having a single
crystal structure such as the boule and wafer) has a number of uses in IC fabrication,
including [14]: conducting material for leads, gate electrodes in MOS devices, and contact
material in shallow junction devices. Chemical vapor deposition to coat polysilicon onto a
wafer involves reduction of silane at temperatures around 600 C (1100 F), as expressed by
the following:
SiH4 ! Si þ 2H2

ð34:8Þ

Epitaxial Deposition A related process for growing a film onto a substrate is epitaxial
deposition, distinguished by the feature that the film has a crystalline structure that is an
extension of the substrate’s structure. If the film material is the same as the substrate (e.g.,
silicon on silicon), then its crystal lattice will be identical to and a continuation of the wafer
crystal. Two primary techniques to perform epitaxial deposition are vapor-phase epitaxy
and molecular-beam epitaxy.
Vapor-phase epitaxy is the most important in semiconductor processing and is based
on chemical vapor deposition. In growing silicon on silicon, the process is accomplished
under closely controlled conditions at higher temperatures than conventional CVD of Si,
using diluted reacting gases to slow the process so that an epitaxial layer can be successfully
formed. Various reactions are possible, including Eq. (34.8), but the most widely used
industrial process involves hydrogen reduction of silicon tetrachloride gas (SiCl4) at around
1100 C (2000 F) as follows:
SiCl4 þ 2H2 ! Si þ 4HCl

815

The melting point of silicon is 1410 C (2570 F), so the preceding reaction is carried
out at temperatures below Tm for Si, considered an advantage for vapor-phase epitaxy.
Molecular-beam epitaxy uses a vacuum evaporation process (Section 28.5.1), in
which silicon together with one or more dopants are vaporized and transported to the
substrate in a vacuum chamber. Its advantage is that it can be carried out at lower
temperatures than CVD; processing temperatures are 400 C to 800 C (750 F to
1450 F). However, throughput is relatively low and equipment is expensive.

34.4.3 INTRODUCTION OF IMPURITIES INTO SILICON
IC technology relies on the ability to alter the electrical properties of silicon by introducing
impurities into selected regions at the surface. Adding impurities into the silicon surface is
called doping. The doped regions are used to create p-n junctions that form the transistors,
diodes, and other devices in the circuit. A silicon-dioxide mask produced by thermal
oxidation and photolithography is used to isolate the silicon regions that are to be doped.
Common elements used as impurities are boron (B), which forms electron acceptor regions
in the silicon substrate (p-type regions); and phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony
(Sb), which form electron donor regions (n-type regions). The predominant technique by
which silicon is doped with these elements is ion implantation.
In ion implantation, vaporized ions of the impurity element are accelerated by an
electric field and directed at the silicon substrate surface (Section 28.2.2). The atoms
penetrate into the surface, losing energy and finally stopping at some depth in the crystal
structure, the average depth being determined by the mass of the ion and the acceleration
voltage. Higher voltages produce greater depths of penetration, typically several hundred
Angstroms (1 Angstrom ¼ 104 mm ¼ 101 nm). Advantages of ion implantation are that it
can be accomplished at room temperature and provides exact doping density.
The problem with ion implantation is that the ion collisions disrupt and damage the
crystal lattice structure. Very-high-energy collisions can transform the starting crystalline
material into an amorphous structure. This problem is solved by annealing at temperatures between 500 C and 900 C (1000 F and 1800 F), which allows the lattice structure to
repair itself and return to its crystal state.

34.4.4 METALLIZATION
Conductive materials must be deposited onto the wafer during processing to serve several
functions: (1) form certain components (e.g., gates) of devices in the IC; (2) provide
intraconnecting conduction paths between devices on the chip; and (3) connect the chip to
external circuits. To satisfy these functions the conducting materials must be formed into
very fine patterns. The process of fabricating these patterns is known as metallization, and
it combines various thin film deposition technologies with photolithography. In this
section we consider the materials and processes used in metallization. Connecting the
chip to external circuitry also involves IC packaging, which is explored in Section 34.6.
Metallization Materials Materials used in the metallization of silicon-based integrated
circuits must have certain desirable properties, some of which relate to electrical
function, whereas others relate to manufacturing processing. The desirable properties
of a metallization material are [5], [14]: (1) low resistivity; (2) low-contact resistance with
silicon, (3) good adherence to the underlying material, usually Si or SiO2; (4) ease of
deposition, compatible with photolithography; (5) chemical stability–noncorroding,
nonreactive, and noncontaminating; (6) physical stability during temperatures encountered in processing; and (7) good lifetime stability.

Chapter 34/Processing of Integrated Circuits

Although no material meets all of these requirements perfectly, aluminum satisfies
most of them either well or adequately, and it is the most widely used metallization material.
Aluminum is usually alloyed with small amounts of (1) silicon to reduce reactivity with
silicon in the substrate, and (2) copper to inhibit electromigration of Al atoms caused by
current flow when the IC is in service. Other materials used for metallization in integrated
circuits include polysilicon (Si); gold (Au); refractory metals (e.g., W, Mo); silicides (e.g.,
WSi2, MoSi2, TaSi2); and nitrides (e.g., TaN, TiN, and ZrN). These other materials are
generally used in applications such as gates and contacts. Aluminum is generally favored for
device intraconnections and top level connections to external circuitry.
Metallization Processes A number of processes are available to accomplish metallization in IC fabrication: physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and
electroplating. Among PVD processes, vacuum evaporation and sputtering are applicable (Section 28.5.1). Vacuum evaporation can be applied for aluminum metallization.
Vaporization is usually accomplished by resistance heating or electron beam evaporation. Evaporation is difficult or impossible for depositing refractory metals and compounds. Sputtering can be used for depositing aluminum as well as refractory metals and
certain metallizing compounds. It achieves better step coverage than evaporation, often
important after many processing cycles when the surface contour has become irregular.
However, deposition rates are lower and equipment is more expensive.
Chemical vapor deposition is also applicable as a metallization technique. Its
processing advantages include excellent step coverage and good deposition rates. Materials
suited to CVD include tungsten, molybdenum, and most of the silicides used in semiconductor metallization. CVD for metallization in semiconductor processing is less
common than PVD. Finally, electroplating (Section 28.3.1) is occasionally used in IC
fabrication to increase the thickness of thin films.

34.4.5 ETCHING
All of the preceding processes in this section involve addition of material to the wafer surface,
either in the form of a thin film or the doping of the surface with an impurity element. Certain
steps in IC manufacturing require material removal from the surface; this is accomplished by
etching away the unwanted material. Etching is usually done selectively, by coating surface
areas that are to be protected and leaving other areas exposed for etching. The coating may be
an etch-resistant photoresist, or it may be a previously applied layer of material such as silicon
dioxide. We briefly encountered etching in our description of photolithography. This section
gives some of the technical details of this step in IC fabrication.
There are two main categories of etching process in semiconductor processing: wet
chemical etching and dry plasma etching. Wet chemical etching is the older of the two
processes and is easier to use. However, there are certain disadvantages that have resulted
in growing use of dry plasma etching.

Profile of a properly

Wet Chemical Etching Wet chemical etching involves the use of an aqueous solution,
usually an acid, to etch away a target material. The etching solution is selected because it
chemically attacks the specific material to be removed and not the protective layer used as a
mask. Some of the common etchants used to remove materials in wafer processing are listed in
Table 34.2.
In its simplest form, the process can be accomplished by immersing the masked wafers
in an appropriate etchant for a specified time and then immediately transferring them to a
thorough rinsing procedure to stop the etching. Process variables such as immersion time,
etchant concentration, and temperature are important in determining the amount of material
removed. A properly etched layer will have a profile as shown in Figure 34.13. Note that the
etching reaction is isotropic (it proceeds equally in all directions), resulting in an undercut
below the protective mask. In general, wet chemical etching is isotropic, and so the mask
pattern must be sized to compensate for this effect.
Note also that the etchant does not attack the layer below the target material in our
illustration. In the ideal case, an etching solution can be formulated that will react only
with the target material and not with other materials in contact with it. In practical cases,
the other materials exposed to the etchant may be attacked but to a lesser degree than the
target material. The etch selectivity of the etchant is the ratio of etching rates between the
target material and some other material, such as the mask or substrate material. For
example, etch selectivity of hydrofluoric acid for SiO2 over Si is infinite.
If process control is inadequate, either under-etching or over-etching can occur, as in
Figure 34.14. Underetching, in which the target layer is not completely removed, results
when the etching time is too short and/or the etching solution is too weak. Over-etching
involves too much of the target material being removed, resulting in loss of pattern
definition and possible damage to the layer beneath the target layer. Over-etching is caused
by overexposure to the etchant.
Dry Plasma Etching This etching process uses an ionized gas to etch a target material.
The ionized gas is created by introducing an appropriate gas mixture into a vacuum chamber

and using radio frequency (RF) electrical energy to ionize a portion of the gas, thus creating
a plasma. The high-energy plasma reacts with the target surface, vaporizing the material to
remove it. There are several ways in which a plasma can be used to etch a material; the two
principal processes in IC fabrication are plasma etching and reactive ion etching.
In plasma etching, the function of the ionized gas is to generate atoms or molecules
that are chemically very reactive, so that the target surface is chemically etched upon
exposure. The plasma etchants are usually based on fluorine or chlorine gases. Etch
selectivity is generally more of a problem in plasma etching than in wet chemical etching.
For example, etch selectivity for SiO2 over Si in a typical plasma etching process is 15 at
best [4], compared with infinity with HF chemical etching.
An alternative function of the ionized gas can be to physically bombard the target
material, causing atoms to be ejected from the surface. This is the process of sputtering,
one of the techniques in physical vapor deposition. When used for etching, the process is
called sputter etching. Although this form of etching has been applied in semiconductor
processing, it is much more common to combine sputtering with plasma etching as
described in the preceding, which results in the process known as reactive ion etching.
This produces both chemical and physical etching of the target surface.
The advantage of the plasma etching processes over wet chemical etching is that
they are much more anisotropic. This property can be readily defined with reference to
Figure 34.15. In (a), a fully anisotropic etch is shown; the undercut is zero. The degree to
which an etching process is anisotropic is defined as the ratio:
A¼

d
u

ð34:10Þ

where A ¼ degree of anisotropy; d ¼ depth of etch, which in most cases will be the thickness
of the etched layer; and u ¼ the undercut dimension, as illustrated in Figure 34.15(b).
Wet chemical etching usually yields A values around 1.0, indicating isotropic etching.
In sputter etching, ion bombardment of the surface is nearly perpendicular, resulting in A
values approaching infinity—almost fully anisotropic. Plasma etching and reactive ion
etching have high degrees of anisotropy, but below those achieved in sputter etching. As IC
feature sizes continue to shrink, anisotropy becomes increasingly important for achieving
the required dimensional tolerances.

34.5 INTEGRATING THE FABRICATION STEPS
In Sections 34.3 and 34.4, we examined the individual processing technologies used in IC
fabrication. In this section, we show how these technologies are combined into the
sequence of steps to produce an integrated circuit.
The planar processing sequence consists of fabricating a series of layers of various
materials in selected areas on a silicon substrate. The layers form insulating, semiconducting,

or conducting regions on the substrate to create the particular electronic devices required in
the integrated circuit. The layers might also serve the temporary function of masking certain
areas so that a particular process is only applied to desired portions of the surface. The masks
are subsequently removed.
The layers are formed by thermal oxidation, epitaxial growth, deposition techniques
(CVD and PVD), diffusion, and ion implantation. In Table 34.3, we summarize the processes
typically used to add or alter a layer of a given material type. The use of lithography to apply a
particular process only to selected regions of the surface is illustrated in Figure 34.16.
An example will be useful here to show the process integration in IC fabrication. We
will use an n-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) logic device to illustrate the
processing sequence. The sequence for NMOS integrated circuits is less complex than for
CMOS or bipolar technologies, although the processes for these IC categories are basically
similar. The device to be fabricated is illustrated in Figure 34.1.
The starting substrate is a lightly doped p-type silicon wafer, which will form the base
of the n-channel transistor. The processing steps are illustrated in Figure 34.17 and
described here (some details have been simplified, and the metallization process for
intraconnecting devices has been omitted): (1) A layer of Si3N4 is deposited by CVD onto
the Si substrate using photolithography to define the regions. This layer of Si3N4 will serve
as a mask for the thermal oxidation process in the next step. (2) SiO2 is grown in the
exposed regions of the surface by thermal oxidation. The SiO2 regions are insulating and
will become the means by which this device is isolated from other devices in the circuit.
(3) The Si3N4 mask is stripped by etching. (4) Another thermal oxidation is done to add a
thin gate oxide layer to previously uncoated surfaces and increase the thickness of the
previous SiO2 layer. (5) Polysilicon is deposited by CVD onto the surface and then doped
n-type using ion implantation. (6) The polysilicon is selectively etched using photolithography to leave the gate electrode of the transistor. (7) The source and drain regions
(n+) are formed by ion implantation of arsenic (As) into the substrate. An implantation
energy level is selected that will penetrate the thin SiO2 layer but not the polysilicon gate

34.6 IC PACKAGING
After all of the processing steps on the wafer have been completed, a final series of
operations must be accomplished to transform the wafer into individual chips, ready to
connect to external circuits and prepared to withstand the harsh environment of the world
outside the clean room. These final steps are referred to as IC packaging. (As we shall see in
the following chapter, packaging extends beyond the preparation of individual IC chips.)
Packaging of integrated circuits is concerned with design issues such as (1) electrical
connections to external circuits; (2) materials to encase the chip and protect it from the
environment (humidity, corrosion, temperature, vibration, mechanical shock); (3) heat
dissipation; (4) performance, reliability, and service life; and (5) cost.
There are also manufacturing issues in packaging, including: (1) chip separation—
cutting the wafer into individual chips, (2) connecting it to the package, (3) encapsulating
the chip, and (4) circuit testing. The manufacturing issues are the ones of greatest interest in
this section. Although most of the design issues are properly left to other texts [8], [11], and
[13], let us examine some of the engineering aspects of IC packages and the types of IC
packages available, before describing the package processing steps to make them.

34.6.1 IC PACKAGE DESIGN
In this section we consider three topics related to the design of an integrated circuit
package: (1) the number of input/output terminals required for an IC of a given size,
(2) the materials used in IC packages, and (3) package styles.

Section 34.6/IC Packaging

821

Determining the Number of Input/Output Terminals The basic engineering problem
in IC packaging is to connect the many internal circuits to input/output (I/O) terminals so
that the appropriate electrical signals can be communicated between the IC and the outside
world. As the number of devices in an IC increases, the required number of I/O terminals
(leads) also increases. The problem is of course aggravated by trends in semiconductor
technology that have led to decreases in device size and increases in the number of devices
that can be packed into an IC. Fortunately, the number of I/O terminals does not have to
equal the number of devices in the IC. The dependency between the two values is given by
Rent’s rule, named after the IBM engineer (E. F. Rent) who defined the following
relationship around 1960:
nio ¼ C ncm

ð34:11Þ

where nio ¼ the number of input/output terminals required; nc ¼ the number of circuits in
the IC, usually taken to be the number of logic gates; and C and m are parameters in the
equation.
Commonly accepted C and m values are 4.5 and 0.5 for a modern VLSI microprocessor
circuit. However, the parameters in Rent’s rule depend on the type of circuit. Memory
devices require far fewer I/O terminals than microprocessors because of the column and row
structure of memory units. Typical values for a static memory device are C ¼ 6.0 and m ¼ 0.12.
IC Package Materials Package sealing involves encapsulating the IC chip in an appropriate packaging material. Two material types dominate current packaging technology:
ceramic and plastic. Metal was used in early packaging designs but is today no longer
important, except for lead frames.
The common ceramic packaging material is alumina (Al2O3). Advantages of ceramic
packaging include hermetic sealing of the IC chip and the fact that highly complex packages
can be produced. Disadvantages include poor dimensional control because of shrinkage
during firing and the high dielectric constant of alumina.
Plastic IC packages are not hermetically sealed, but their cost is lower than ceramic.
They are generally used for mass produced ICs, where very high reliability is not required.
Plastics used in IC packaging include epoxies, polyimides, and silicones.
IC Package Styles Awide variety of IC package styles is available to meet the input/output
requirements indicated in the preceding. In nearly all applications, the IC is a component in a
larger electronic system and must be attached to a printed circuit board (PCB). There are two
broad categories of component mounting to a PCB, shown in Figure 34.18: through-hole and
surface mount. In through-hole mounting, also known as pin-in-hole (PIH) technology, the IC
package and other electronic components (e.g., discrete resistors, capacitors) have leads that
are inserted through holes in the board and are soldered on the underside. In surface-mount
technology (SMT), the components are attached to the surface of the board (or in some cases,
both top and bottom surfaces). Several lead configurations are available in SMT, as illustrated
in (b), (c), and (d) of the figure.

Chapter 34/Processing of Integrated Circuits

FIGURE 34.19 Dual in-line package with
16 terminals, shown as a through-hole
configuration.

The major styles of IC packages include (1) dual in-line package, (2) square package,
and (3) pin grid array. Some of these are available in both through-hole and surface-mount
styles, whereas others are designed for only one mounting method.
The dual in-line package (DIP) is currently the most common form of IC package,
available in both through-hole and surface-mount configurations. It has two rows of leads
(terminals) on either side of a rectangular body, as in Figure 34.19. Spacing between leads
(center-to-center distance) in the conventional through-hole DIP is 2.54 mm (0.1 in), and
the number of leads ranges between 8 and 64. Hole spacing in the through-hole DIP style is
limited by the ability to drill holes closely together in a printed circuit board. This limitation
can be relaxed with surface-mount technology because the leads are not inserted into the
board; standard lead spacing on surface-mount DIPs is 1.27 mm (0.05 in).
The number of terminals in a DIP is limited by its rectangular shape in which leads
project only from two sides; that means that the number of leads on either side is nio/2. For
high values of nio (between 48 and 64), differences in conducting lengths between leads in
the middle of the DIP and those on the ends cause problems in high-speed electrical
characteristics. Some of these problems are addressed with a square package, in which the
leads are arranged around the periphery so that the number of terminals on a side is nio/4. A
surface-mount square package is illustrated in Figure 34.20.
Even with a square chip package, there is still a practical upper limit on terminal count
dictated by the manner in which the leads in the package are linearly allocated. The number
of leads on a package can be maximized by using a square matrix of pins. A pin grid array
(PGA) consists of a two-dimensional array of pin terminals on the underside of a square chip
enclosure. In the ideal, the entire bottom surface of the package is fully occupied by pins, so
that the pin count in each direction is square root of nio. However, as a practical matter, the
center area of the package has no pins because this region contains the IC chip.

34.6.2 PROCESSING STEPS IN IC PACKAGING
The packaging of an IC chip in manufacturing can be divided into the following steps:
(1) wafer testing, (2) chip separation, (3) die bonding, (4) wire bonding, and (5) package
sealing. After packaging, a final functional test is performed on each packaged IC.

Wafer Testing Current semiconductor processing techniques provide several hundred
individual ICs per wafer. It is convenient to perform certain functional tests on the ICs while
they are still together on the wafer—before chip separation. Testing is accomplished by
computer-controlled test equipment that uses a set of needle probes configured to match the
connecting pads on the surface of the chip; multiprobe is the term used for this testing
procedure. When the probes contact the pads, a series of DC tests are carried out to indicate
short circuits and other faults; this is followed by a functional test of the IC. Chips that fail the
test are marked with an ink dot; these defects are not packaged. Each IC is positioned in its
turn beneath the probes for testing, using a high precision x-y table to index the wafer from
one chip site to the next.
Chip Separation The next step after testing is to cut the wafer into individual chips (dice). A
thin diamond-impregnated saw blade is used to perform the cutting operation. The sawing
machine is highly automatic and its alignment with the ‘‘streets’’ between circuits is very
accurate. The wafer is attached to a piece of adhesive tape that is mounted in a frame. The
adhesive tape holds the individual chips in place during and after sawing; the frame is a
convenience in subsequent handling of the chips. Chips with ink dots are now discarded.
Die Bonding The individual chips must next be attached to their individual packages, a
procedure called die bonding. Owing to the miniature size of the chips, automated handling
systems are used to pick the separated chips from the tape frame and place them for die
bonding. Various techniques have been developed to bond the chip to the packaging
substrate; we describe two methods here: eutectic die bonding and epoxy die bonding.
Eutectic die bonding, used for ceramic packages, consists of (1) depositing a thin film of gold
on the bottom surface of the chip; (2) heating the base of the ceramic package to
a temperature above 370 C (698 F), the eutectic temperature of the Au–Si system; and
(3) bonding the chip to the metallization pattern on the heated base. In epoxy die bonding,
used for plastic VLSI packaging, a small amount of epoxy is dispensed on the package base
(the lead frame), and the chip is positioned on the epoxy; the epoxy is then cured, bonding the
chip to the surface.
Wire Bonding After the die is bonded to the package, electrical connections are made
between the contact pads on the chip surface and the package leads. The connections are
generally made using small-diameter wires of aluminum or gold, as illustrated in Figure 34.21.
Typical wire diameters for aluminum are 0.05 mm (0.002 in), and gold wire diameters are
about half that diameter. (Au has higher electrical conductivity than Al, but is more
expensive.) Aluminum wires are bonded by ultrasonic bonding, whereas gold wires are
bonded by thermocompression, thermosonic, or ultrasonic means. Ultrasonic bonding uses
ultrasonic energy to weld the wire to the pad surface. Thermocompression bonding involves
heating the end of the wire to form a molten ball, and then the ball is pressed into the pad to
form the bond. Thermosonic bonding combines ultrasonic and thermal energies to form the

bond. Automatic wire bonding machines are used to perform these operations at rates up to
200 bonds per minute.
Package Sealing As mentioned, the two common packaging materials are ceramic and
plastic. The processing methods are different for the two materials. Ceramic packages are
made from a dispersion of ceramic powder (Al2O3 is most common) in a liquid binder (e.g.,
polymer and solvent). The mix is first formed into thin sheets and dried, and then cut to size.
Holes are punched for interconnections. The required wiring paths are then fabricated onto
each sheet, and metal is filled into the holes. The sheets are then laminated by pressing and
sintering to form a monolithic (single stone) body.
Two types of plastic package are available, postmolded and premolded. In postmolded packages, an epoxy thermosetting plastic is transfer molded around the assembled
chip and lead frame (after wire bonding), in effect transforming the pieces into one solid
body. However, the molding process can be harsh on the delicate bond wires, and premolded
packages are an alternative. In premolded packaging, an enclosure base is molded before
encapsulation and then the chip and lead frame are connected to it, adding a solid lid or
other material to provide protection.
Final Testing Upon completion of the packaging sequence, each IC must undergo a
final test, the purpose of which is to (1) determine which units, if any, have been damaged
during packaging; and (2) measure performance characteristics of each device.
Burn-in test procedures sometimes include elevated temperature testing, in
which the packaged IC is placed in an oven at temperatures around 125 C (250 F)
for 24 hours and then tested. A device that fails such a test would have been likely to
have failed early during service. If the device is intended for environments in which
wide temperature variations occur, a temperature cycle test is appropriate. This test
subjects each device to a series of temperature reversals, between values around –50 C
(–60 F) on the lower side and 125 C (250 F) on the upper side. Additional tests for
devices requiring high reliability might include mechanical vibration tests and hermetic
(leak) tests.

34.7 YIELDS IN IC PROCESSING
The fabrication of integrated circuits consists of many processing steps performed in
sequence. In wafer processing in particular, there may be hundreds of distinct operations
through which the wafer passes. At each step, there is a chance that something may go
wrong, resulting in the loss of the wafer or portions of it corresponding to individual chips.
A simple probability model to predict the final yield of good product is
Y ¼ Y 1Y 2 . . . Yn
where Y ¼ final yield; Y1, Y2, Yn are the yields of each processing step; and n ¼ total
number of steps in the processing sequence.
As a practical matter, this model, although perfectly valid, is difficult to use
because of the large number of steps involved and the variability of yields for each step. It
is more convenient to divide the processing sequence into major phases, as we have
organized our discussion in this chapter (see Figure 34.3), and to define the yields for
each phase. The first phase involves growth of the single-crystal boule. The term crystal
yield Yc refers to the amount of single-crystal material in the boule compared with the
starting amount of electronic grade silicon. The typical crystal yield is about 50%. After
crystal growing, the boule is sliced into wafers, the yield for which is described as the

E1C34

11/10/2009

15:58:59

Page 825

Section 34.7/Yields in IC Processing

825

crystal-to-slice yield Ys. This depends on the amount of material lost during grinding of
the boule, the width of the saw blade relative to the wafer thickness during slicing, and
other losses. A typical value might be 50%, although much of the lost silicon during
grinding and slicing is recyclable.
The next phase is wafer processing to fabricate the individual ICs. From a yield
viewpoint, this can be divided into wafer yield and multiprobe yield. Wafer yield Yw refers
to the number of wafers that survive processing compared to the starting quantity. Certain
wafers are designated as test pieces or similar uses and therefore result in losses and a
reduction in yield; in other cases, wafers are broken or processing conditions go awry.
Typical values of wafer yield are around 70% if testing losses are included. For wafers that
come through processing and are multiprobe tested, only a certain proportion pass the test,
called the multiprobe yield Ym. Multiprobe yield is highly variable and can range from very
low values (less than 10%) to relatively high values (more than 90%), depending on IC
complexity and worker skill in the processing areas.
Following packaging, final testing of the IC is performed. This invariably produces
additional losses, resulting in a final test yield Yt in the range 90% to 95%. If the five
phase yields are combined, the final yield can be estimated by
Y ¼ Y cY sY wY mY t

ð34:12Þ

Given the typical values at each step, the final yield compared with the starting amount of
silicon is quite low.
The heart of IC fabrication is wafer processing, the yield from which is measured in
multiprobe testing Ym. Yields in the other areas are fairly predictable, but not in wafer-fab.
Two types of processing defects can be distinguished in wafer processing: (1) area defects
and (2) point defects. Area defects are those that affect major areas of the wafer, possibly
the entire surface. These are caused by variations or incorrect settings in process
parameters. Examples include added layers that are too thin or too thick, insufficient
diffusion depths in doping, and over- or under-etching. In general these defects are
correctable by improved process control or development of alternative processes that are
superior. For example, doping by ion implantation has largely replaced diffusion, and dry
plasma etching has been substituted for wet chemical etching to better control feature
dimensions.
Point defects occur at very localized areas on the wafer surface, affecting only one or a
limited number of ICs in a particular area. They are commonly caused by dust particles either
on the wafer surface or the lithographic masks. Point defects also include dislocations in the
crystal lattice structure (Section 2.3.2). These point defects are distributed in some way over
the surface of the wafer, resulting in a yield that is a function of the density of the defects, their
distribution over the surface, and the processed area of the wafer. If the area defects are
assumed negligible, and the point defects are assumed uniform over the surface area of the
wafer, the resulting yield can be modeled by the equation
Ym ¼

1
1 þ AD

ð34:13Þ

where Ym ¼ the yield of good chips as determined in multiprobe; A ¼ the area processed,
cm2 (in2); and D ¼ density of point defects, defects/cm2 (defects/in2). This equation is
based on Bose-Einstein statistics and has been found to be a good predictor of wafer
processing performance, especially for highly integrated chips (VLSI and beyond).
Wafer processing is the key to successful fabrication of integrated circuits. For an IC
producer to be profitable, high yields must be achieved during this phase of manufacturing. This is accomplished using the purest possible starting materials, the latest equipment
technologies, good process control over the individual processing steps, maintenance of
clean room conditions, and efficient and effective inspection and testing procedures.

Integrated circuits constitute the heart of an electronic system, but the complete system consists of much more than
packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are mounted
and interconnected on printed circuit boards, which in turn
are interconnected and contained in a chassis or cabinet.
Chip packaging (Section 34.6) is only part of the total
electronic package. In this chapter we consider the remaining
levels of the package and how they are manufactured and
assembled.

35.1

ELECTRONICS PACKAGING

The electronics package is the physical means by which the
components in a system are electrically interconnected and
interfaced to external devices; it includes the mechanical
structure that holds and protects the circuitry. Awell-designed
electronics package serves the following functions: (1) power
distribution and signal interconnection, (2) structural support,
(3) circuit protection from physical and chemical hazards in
the environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the
circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission
within the system.
For complex systems containing many components
and interconnections, the electronics package is organized
into levels that comprise a packaging hierarchy, illustrated
in Figure 35.1 and summarized in Table 35.1. The lowest
level is the zero level, which refers to the intraconnections
on the semiconductor chip. The packaged chip, consisting
of the IC in a plastic or ceramic enclosure and connected to
the package leads, constitutes the first level of packaging.
Packaged chips and other components are assembled
to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies
(Section 35.6.1): (1) pin-in-hole (PIH) technology and
(2) surface-mount technology (SMT). The chip package
styles and assembly techniques are different for PIH and
SMT. In many cases, both assembly technologies are

employed in the same board. Printed circuit board assembly represents the second level of
packaging. Figure 35.2 shows a variety of PCB assemblies of both PIH and SMT types.
The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this is
the third level of packaging. This third level may consist of a rack that holds the boards,
using wiring cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems, such as large
computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed circuit board called a back
plane, which has conduction paths to permit interconnection between the smaller boards
attached to it. This latter configuration is known as card-on-board (COB) packaging, in
which the smaller PCBs are called cards and the back plane is the board.
The fourth level of packaging consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet that
contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the packaging
may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.

35.2 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS
A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material, with thin
copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components attached to the
board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conducting paths are interleaved
between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic systems to hold components,
provide electrical interconnections among them, and make connections to external circuits.
They have become standard building blocks in virtually all electronic systems that contain
packaged ICs and other components (Historical Note 35.1). PCBs are so important and
widely used because (1) they provide a convenient structural platform for the components;
(2) a board with correctly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently,
without the variability usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering
connections between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step
mechanized operation, (4) an assembled PCB gives reliable performance; and (5) in
complex electronic systems, each assembled PCB can be detached from the system for
service, repair, or replacement.

Historical Note 35.1

B

Printed circuit boards

efore printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic
components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal
chassis and then hand wired and soldered to form the
desired circuit. The usual sheet metal was aluminum.
In the late 1950s, various plastic boards became

commercially available. These boards, which provided
electrical insulation, gradually replaced the aluminum
chassis. The first plastics were phenolics, followed by
glass-fiber–reinforced epoxies. The boards came with
predrilled holes spaced at standard intervals in both

E1C35

Page 833

Section 35.2/Printed Circuit Boards

directions. This inspired the use of electronic
components that matched these hole spacings. The
dual-in-line package evolved during this period.
The components in these circuit boards were handwired, which proved increasingly difficult and prone to
human error as component densities increased and
circuits became more complex. The printed circuit
board, with etched copper foil on its surface to form the
wiring interconnections, was developed to solve these
problems with manual wiring.
Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved
a manual inking procedure, in which the designer
attempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the
required connections and avoid short circuits on a large
sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difficult as

833

the number of components on the board increased and
the conducting lines interconnecting the components
became finer. Computer programs were developed to aid
the designer in solving the routing problem. However, in
many cases, it was impossible to find a solution with no
intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve the problem,
jumper wires were hand-soldered to the board to make
these connections. As the number of jumper wires
increased, the problem of human error again appeared.
Multilayer boards were introduced to deal with this
routing issue.
The initial technique for ‘‘printing’’ the circuit pattern
onto the copper-clad board was screen printing. As track
widths became finer and finer, photolithography was
substituted.

35.2.1 STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBS
A printed circuit board (PCB), also called a printed wiring board (PWB), is a laminated
flat panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical interconnections between
electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made by thin conducting
paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sandwiched between layers of
insulating material. The conducting paths are made of copper and are called tracks. Other
copper areas, called lands, are also available on the board surface for attaching and
electrically connecting components.
Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with glass
fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and polyimide. E-glass is
the usual fiber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy PCBs; paper is a common
reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to 3.2 mm
(0.031 to 0.125 in), and copper foil thickness is around 0.04 mm (0.0015 in). The materials
forming the PCB structure must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage,
dimensionally stable, heat resistant, and flame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the
polymer composite to obtain the last two characteristics.
There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 35.3: (a)
single-sided board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation substrate;
(b) double-sided board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the substrate; and
(c) multilayer board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting foil and insulation. In
all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of multiple laminates of epoxy-glass
sheets (or other composite) bonded together to form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer
boards are used for complex circuit assemblies in which a large number of components
must be interconnected with many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths
than can be accommodated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common
multilayer configuration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.

35.2.2 PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS
Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize in mass
producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed by a circuit fabricator
to create the specified circuit pattern and board size for a given application. Multilayer boards

Chapter 35/Electronics Assembly and Packaging

FIGURE 35.3
(c) multilayer.

Three types of printed circuit board structure: (a) single-sided, (b) double-sided, and

are fabricated from standard single- and double-sided boards. The circuit fabricator processes
the boards separately to form the required circuit pattern for each layer in the final structure,
and then the individual boards are bonded together with additional layers of epoxy-fabric.
Processing of multilayer boards is more involved and more expensive than the other types; the
reason for using them is that they provide better performance for large systems than using a
much greater number of lower-density boards of simpler construction.
The copper foil used to clad the starting boards is produced by a continuous electroforming process (Section 28.3.2), in which a rotating smooth metal drum is partially
submersed in an electrolytic bath containing copper ions. The drum is the cathode in the
circuit, causing the copper to plate onto its surface. As the drum rotates out of the bath, the thin
copper foil is peeled from its surface. The process is ideal for producing the very thin copper
foil needed for PCBs.
Production of the starting boards consists of pressing multiple sheets of woven glass
fiber that have been impregnated with partially cured epoxy (or other thermosetting
polymer). The number of sheets used in the starting sandwich determines the thickness
of the final board. Copper foil is placed on one or both sides of the epoxy-glass laminated
stack, depending on whether single- or double-sided boards are to be made. For single-sided
boards, a thin release film is used on one side in place of the copper foil to prevent sticking of
the epoxy in the press. Pressing is accomplished between two steam-heated platens of a
hydraulic press. The combination of heat and pressure compacts and cures the epoxy-glass
layers to bond and harden the laminates into a single-piece board. The board is then cooled
and trimmed to remove excess epoxy that has been squeezed out around the edges.
The completed board consists of a glass-fabric–reinforced epoxy panel, clad with
copper over its surface area on one or both sides. It is now ready for the circuit fabricator.
Panels are usually produced in large standard widths designed to match the board handling
systems on wave-soldering equipment, automatic insertion machines, and other PCB
processing and assembly facilities. If the electronic design calls for a smaller size, several
units can be processed together on the same larger board and then separated later.

35.2.3 PROCESSES USED IN PCB FABRICATION
The circuit fabricator employs a variety of processing operations to produce a finished PCB,
ready for assembly of components. The operations include cleaning, shearing, hole drilling

or punching, pattern imaging, etching, and electroless and electrolytic plating. Most of these
processes have been discussed. In this section we focus on the details that are relevant to
PCB fabrication. Our discussion follows approximately the order in which the processes are
performed on a board. However, there are differences in processing sequence between
different board types, and we examine these differences in Section 35.2.4. Some of the
operations in PCB fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid
defects in the printed circuits, especially for boards with fine tracks and details.
Board Preparation Initial preparation of the board consists of shearing, hole-making, and
other shaping operations to create tabs, slots, and similar features in the board. If necessary,
the starting panel may have to be sheared to size for compatibility with the circuit fabricator’s
equipment. The holes, called tooling holes, are made by drilling or punching and are used for
positioning the board during subsequent processing. The sequence of fabrication steps
requires close alignment from one process to the next, and these holes are used with locating
pins at each operation to achieve accurate registration. Three tooling holes per board are
usually sufficient for this purpose; hole size is about 3.2 mm (0.125 in), larger than the circuit
holes to be drilled later.
The board is typically bar coded for identification purposes in this preparation phase.
Finally, a cleaning process is used to remove dirt and grease from the board surface.
Although cleanliness requirements are not as stringent as in IC fabrication, small particles
of dirt and dust can cause defects in the circuit pattern of a printed circuit board; and surface
films of grease can inhibit etching and other chemical processes. Cleanliness is essential for
producing reliable PCBs.
Hole Drilling In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required in PCBs
as (1) insertion holes for inserting component leads in through-hole boards, (2) via holes,
which are later copper-plated and used as conducting paths from one side of the board to
the other, and (3) holes to fasten certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to
the board. These holes are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location.
Cleaner holes can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A
stack of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer
numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instructions from
the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills are sometimes
used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one feed motion.
Standard twist drills (Section 23.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application
makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the
biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter is
generally less than 1.27 mm (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole sizes of
0.15 mm (0.006 in) or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and their capacity to
dissipate heat is low.
Another difficulty is the unique work material. The drill bit must first pass through a
thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass composite. Different
drills would normally be specified for these materials, but a single drill must suffice in PCB
drilling. The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer
boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip extraction
from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high accuracy in hole
location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs are usually formed
when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are often placed on top of and
beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on the boards themselves.
Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best
efficiency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter. For very small drill sizes,
this means extremely high rotational speeds—up to 100,000 rev/min in some cases. Special
spindle bearings and motors are required to achieve these speeds.

Chapter 35/Electronics Assembly and Packaging

Circuit Pattern Imaging and Etching There are two basic methods by which the circuit
pattern is transferred to the copper surface of the board: screen printing and photolithography. Both methods involve the use of a resist coating on the board surface that
determines where etching of the copper will occur to create the tracks and lands of the
circuit.
Screen printing was the first method used for PCBs. It is indeed a printing technique,
and the term ‘‘printed circuit board’’ can be traced to this method. In screen printing, a
stencil screen containing the circuit pattern is placed on the board, and liquid resist is
squeezed through the mesh to the surface beneath. This method is simple and inexpensive,
but its resolution is limited. It is normally used only for applications in which track widths
are greater than about 0.25 mm (0.010 in).
The second method of transferring the circuit pattern is photolithography, in which
a light-sensitive resist material is exposed through a mask to transfer the circuit pattern.
The procedure is similar to the corresponding process in IC fabrication (Section 34.3.1);
some of the details in PCB processing will be described here.
Photoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or dry film.
Liquid resists can be applied by roller or spraying. Dry film resists are more commonly used
in PCB fabrication. They consist of three layers: a film of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between a polyester support sheet on one side and a removable plastic cover sheet
on the other side. The cover sheet prevents the photosensitive material from sticking during
storage and handling. Although more expensive than liquid resists, they can be applied in
coatings of uniform thickness, and their processing in photolithography is simpler. To apply,
the cover sheet is removed, and the resist film is placed on the copper surface to which it
readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto the surface.
Alignment of the masks relative to the board relies on the use of registration holes
that are aligned with the tooling holes on the board. Contact printing is used to expose the
resist beneath the mask. The resist is then developed, which involves removal of the
unexposed regions of the negative resist from the surface.
After resist development, certain areas of the copper surface remain covered by
resist while other areas are now unprotected. The covered areas correspond to circuit
tracks and lands, while uncovered areas correspond to open regions between. Etching
removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board surface, usually
by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms the solid copper film
into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.
Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the surface
of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are used to remove
copper, including ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH),
cupric chloride (CuCl2), and ferric chloride (FeCl3). Each has its relative advantages and
disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature, etchant concentration, and duration)
must be closely controlled to avoid over- or under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching,
the board must be rinsed and the remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface.
Plating In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide
conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers in
multilayer boards. Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication: electroplating and
electroless plating (Section 28.3.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition rate than electroless
plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conductive); electroless plating is
slower but does not require a conductive surface.
After drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist of epoxyglass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless plating must be
used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls. Once the thin film of copper
has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to increase coating thickness on the hole
surfaces to between 0.025 and 0.05 mm (0.001 and 0.002 in).

Gold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as a
very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact. Coating
thickness is only about 2.5 mm (0.0001 in).

35.2.4 PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE
In this section we describe the processing sequence for various board types. The sequence
is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a printed
circuit board, a procedure called circuitization. The desired result is illustrated in
Figure 35.4 for a double-sided board.
Circuitization Three methods of circuitization can be used to determine which regions
of the board will be coated with copper [12]: (1) subtractive, (2) additive, and (3)
semiadditive.
In the subtractive method, open portions of the copper cladding on the starting
board are etched away from the surface, so that the tracks and lands of the desired circuit
remain. The process is called ‘‘subtractive’’ because copper is removed from the board
surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 35.5.
The additive method starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such as the
uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is treated with a
chemical, called a buttercoat, which acts as the catalyst for electroless plating. The steps
in the method are outlined in Figure 35.6.

FIGURE 35.5 The subtractive method of circuitization in PCB fabrication:
(1) apply resist to areas not
to be etched, using photolithography to expose
the areas that are to be
etched, (2) etch, and (3)
strip resist.

FIGURE 35.6 The additive method of circuitization in PCB fabrication: (1) a resist film is applied to the
surface using photolithography to expose the areas to be copper plated; (2) the exposed surface is
chemically activated to serve as a catalyst for electroless plating; (3) copper is plated on exposed areas;
and (4) resist is stripped.

The semiadditive method uses a combination of additive and subtractive steps. The
starting board has a very thin copper film on its surface—5 mm (0.0002 in) or less. The
method proceeds as described in Figure 35.7.
Processing of Different Board Types Processing methods differ for the three PCB
types: single-sided, double-sided, and multilayer. A single-sided board begins fabrication

FIGURE 35.7 The semiadditive method of circuitization in PCB fabrication: (1) Apply resist to areas that will not be
plated; (2) electroplate copper, using the thin copper film for conduction; (3) apply tin on top of plated copper; (4) strip
resist; (5) etch remaining thin film of copper on the surface, while the tin serves as a resist for the electroplated copper; and
(6) strip tin from copper.

as a flat sheet of insulating material clad on one side with copper film. The subtractive
method is used to produce the circuit pattern in the copper cladding.
Adouble-sided boardinvolves asomewhatmorecomplexprocessingsequencebecause
it has circuit tracks on both sides that must be electrically connected. The interconnection is
accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run from lands on one surface of the
board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown in Figure 35.4. A typical fabrication sequence
for a double-sided board (copper-clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole
drilling, electroless plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to
increase plating thickness.
A multilayer board is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this
complexity is reflected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can be
seen in Figure 35.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB. The
fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used for single- and
double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more complicated is that
(1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must first be processed; then (2) the
layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and finally (3) the assembled
board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.
A multilayer board consists of logic layers, which carry electrical signals between
components on the board, and voltage layers, which are used to distribute power. Logic
layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage layers are
usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates are used for multilayer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided counterparts, so that a
suitable thickness of the final board can be achieved.
In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure
starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers, separating
one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with partially cured
epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a final copper foil is placed on the
stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a single board by heating the
assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing, any excess resin squeezed out of
the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.
At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers
bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can therefore
be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise similar. The sequence
consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes to establish conduction paths
between the two exterior copper films as well as certain internal copper layers, and the use of
photolithography and etching to form the circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.
Testing and Finishing Operations After a circuit has been fabricated on the board
surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according to design
specifications and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are common: (1) visual

E1C35

Page 840

Chapter 35/Electronics Assembly and Packaging

inspection and (2) continuity testing. In visual inspection, the board is examined visually to
detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole locations, and other faults that can be
observed without applying electrical power to the board. Visual inspections, performed not
only after fabrication but also at various critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision (Section 42.6.3).
Continuity testing involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into
contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array of probes
that are forced under light pressure to make contact with specified points on the board surface.
Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly checked in this procedure.
Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to prepare
it for assembly. The first of these finishing operations is the application of a thin solder layer
on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper from oxidation and
contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by bringing the copper side into
contact with rotating rollers that are partially submersed in molten solder.
A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of the
board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly. The solder
resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus, in the subsequent
soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist is usually applied by
screen printing.
Finally, an identification legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen printing.
The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the board in
final assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on the board for
production control purposes.

35.3 PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY
A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC packages,
resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat sinks) mounted
on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging (Table 35.1). As indicated,
PCB assembly is based on either pin-in-hole (PIH) or surface-mount technologies (SMT).
Some PCB assemblies include both PIH and SMT components. Our discussion here deals
exclusively with PIH assemblies. In Section 35.4, we consider surface-mount technology
and combinations of the two types. The scope of electronic assembly also includes higher
packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet. In Section 35.5, we explore the technologies by which
electrical connections are made at these higher levels.
In printed circuit assemblies using PIH technology, the lead pins must be inserted into
through-holes in the circuit board. Once inserted, the leads are soldered into place in the
holes in the board. In double-sided and multilayer boards, the hole surfaces into which the
leads are inserted are generally copper plated, giving rise to the name plated through-hole
(PTH) for these cases. After soldering, the boards are cleaned and tested, and those boards
not passing the test are reworked if possible. Thus, we can divide the processing of PIH
assemblies into the following steps: (1) component insertion, (2) soldering, (3) cleaning,
(4) testing, and (5) rework.

35.3.1 COMPONENT INSERTION
In component insertion, the leads of components are inserted into their proper throughholes in the PCB. A single board may be populated with hundreds of separate components
(DIPs, resistors, etc.), all of which need to be inserted into the board. In modern electronic

E1C35

841

assembly plants, most component insertions are accomplished by automatic insertion
machines. A small proportion is done by hand for nonstandard components that cannot be
accommodated on automatic machines. These cases include switches and connectors as
well as resistors, capacitors, and certain other components. Although the proportion of
component insertions accomplished manually in industry is low, their cost is high because of
much lower production rates than automatic insertions. Industrial robots (Section 38.4) are
sometimes used to substitute for human labor in these component insertion tasks.
Automatic insertion machines are either semiautomatic or fully automatic. The
semiautomatic type involves insertion of the component by a mechanical insertion device
whose position relative to the board is controlled by a human operator. Fully automatic
insertion machines comprise the preferred category because they are faster and their need for
human attention is limited to loading components and fixing jams when they occur. Automatic
insertion machines are controlled by a program that is usually prepared directly from circuit
design data. Components are loaded into these machines in the form of reels, magazines, or
other carriers that maintain proper orientation of the components until insertion.
The insertion operation involves (1) preforming the leads, (2) insertion of leads into
the board holes, and then (3) cropping and clinching the leads on the other side of the
board. Preforming is needed only for some component types and involves bending of leads
that are initially straight into a U-shape for insertion. Many components come with
properly shaped leads and require little or no preforming.
Insertion isaccomplished byaworkhead designedfor thecomponenttype.Components
inserted by automatic machines are grouped into three basic categories: (a) axial lead,
(b) radial lead, and (c) dual-in-line package. The dual-in-line package (Section 34.6.1) is a
very common package for integrated circuits. Typical axial and radial lead components are
pictured in Figure 35.9. Axial components are shaped like a cylinder, with leads projecting
from each end. Typical components of this type include resistors, capacitors, and diodes.
Their leads must be bent, as suggested in our figure, to be inserted. Radial components have
parallel leads and have various body shapes, one of which is shown in Figure 35.9(b). This
type of component is exemplified by light-emitting diodes, potentiometers, resistor networks, and fuse holders. These configurations are sufficiently different that separate
insertion machines with the appropriate workhead designs must be used to handle each
category. Accurate positioning of the board beneath the workhead before each insertion is
performed by a high-speed x-y positioning table.
Once the leads have been inserted through the holes in the board, they are clinched
and cropped. Clinching involves bending the leads, as in Figure 35.10, to mechanically
secure the component to the board until soldering. If this were not done, the component
is at risk of being knocked out of its holes during handling. In cropping, the leads are cut
to proper length; otherwise, there is a possibility that they might become bent and cause a
short circuit with nearby circuit tracks or components. These operations are performed
automatically on the underside of the board by the insertion machine.
The three types of insertion machines, corresponding to the three basic component
configurations, can be joined to form an integrated circuit board assembly line. The

three basic component
types used with automatic
insertion machines: (a)
axial lead and (b) radial
lead. The third type, dualin-line package (DIP), is illustrated in Figure 34.19.

integration is accomplished by means of a conveyor system that transfers boards from one
machine type to the next. A computer control system is used to track the progress of each
board as it moves through the cell and download the correct programs to each workstation.

35.3.2 SOLDERING
The second basic step in PCB assembly is soldering. For inserted components, the most
important soldering techniques are wave soldering and hand soldering. These methods as
well as other aspects of soldering are discussed in Section 31.2.
Wave Soldering Wave soldering is a mechanized technique in which printed circuit
boards containing inserted components are moved by conveyor over a standing wave of
molten solder (Figure 31.9). The position of the conveyor is such that only the underside of the
board, with component leads projecting through the holes, is in contact with the solder. The
combination of capillary action and the upward force of the wave cause the liquid solder to
flow into the clearances between leads and through-holes to obtain a good solder joint. The
tremendous advantage of wave soldering is that all of the solder joints on a board are made in
a single pass through the process.
Hand Soldering Hand soldering involves a skilled operator using a soldering iron to make
circuit connections. Compared with wave soldering, hand soldering is slow because solder
joints are made one at a time. As a production method, it is generally used only for small lot
production and rework. As with other manual tasks, human error can result in quality
problems. Hand soldering is sometimes used after wave soldering to add delicate components
that would be damaged in the harsh environment of the wave-soldering chamber. Manual
methods have certain advantages in PCB assembly that should be noted: (1) Heat is localized
and can be directed at a small target area; (2) equipment is inexpensive compared with
wave soldering; and (3) energy consumption is considerably less.

35.3.3 CLEANING, TESTING, AND REWORK
The final processing steps in PCB assembly are cleaning, testing, and rework. Visual
inspections are also performed on the board to detect obvious flaws.
Cleaning After soldering, contaminants are present on the printed circuit assembly. These
foreign substances include flux, oil and grease, salts, and dirt, some of which can cause
chemical degradation of the assembly or interfere with its electronic functions. One or more
chemical cleaning operations (Section 28.1.1) must be carried out to remove these
undesirable materials. Traditional cleaning methods for PCB assemblies include hand
cleaning with appropriate solvents and vapor degreasing with chlorinated solvents. Concern
over environmental hazards in recent years has motivated the search for effective water-

E1C35

16:45:9

Page 843

Section 35.4/Surface-Mount Technology

843

based solvents to replace the chlorinated and fluorinated chemicals traditionally used in
vapor degreasing.
Testing Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or
damaged components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed
by eye. Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in
a growing number of installations.
Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points in the circuit layout.
These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where probes can make contact for
testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested by contacting the component leads,
applying input test signals, and measuring the output signals. More sophisticated procedures
include digital function tests, in which the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a
programmed sequence of input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to
simulate operating conditions.
Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test, in which
a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and energized to perform
its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it is deemed as passing the test.
It is then unplugged and the next production unit is substituted in the mock-up.
Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may be
subject to ‘‘infant mortality.’’ Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in normal
functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early service.
Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time, such as 24 or
72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as 40 C (100 F), to force these defects
to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not subject to infant mortality
will survive this test and provide long service life.
Rework When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on the board
are defective or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense to try to repair the
assembly rather than discard it together with all of the remaining good components. This
repair step is an integral part of electronic assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks
include touchup (repair of solder faults), replacement of defective or missing components,
and repair of copper film that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual
operations, requiring skilled workers using soldering irons.

35.4

SURFACE-MOUNT TECHNOLOGY
One effect of the growing complexity of electronic systems has been the need for greater
packing densities in printed circuit assemblies. Conventional PCB assemblies that use
leaded components inserted into through-holes have the following inherent limitations in
terms of packing density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board,
and (2) center-to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a
minimum of 1.0 mm (0.04 in) and is usually 2.5 mm (0.10 in).
Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads are
soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running through the
board (Historical Note 35.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted into through holes in
the board, several advantages accrue [6]: (1) smaller components can be made, with leads
closer together; (2) packing densities can be increased; (3) components can be mounted on
both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be used for the same electronic system; and
(5) drilling of the many through holes during board fabrication is eliminated—via holes to
interconnect layers are still required. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT
components range between 20% and 60% compared with through-hole components.

Historical Note 35.2

S

Surface-mount technology

urface-mount technology (SMT) traces its origins to
the electronic systems in the aerospace and military
industries of the 1960s. The first components were small,
flat ceramic packages with gull-wing leads. The initial
reason why these packages were attractive, compared
with through-hole technology, was the fact that they
could be placed on both sides of a printed circuit
board—in effect, doubling the component density. In
addition, the SMT package could be made smaller than
a comparable through-hole package, further increasing
component densities on the printed circuit board.

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT
were made in the form of leadless components—
components with ceramic packages that had no
discrete leads. This permitted even greater circuit
densities in military and aerospace electronics. In the
late 1970s, plastic SMT packages became available,
motivating the widespread use of surface-mount
technology. The computer and automotive industries
have become important users of SMT, and their
demand for SMT components has contributed to the
significant growth in this technology.

Despite these advantages, the electronics industry has not fully adopted SMT to the
exclusion of PIH technology. There are several reasons: (1) Owing to their smaller size,
surface mount components are more difficult to handle and assemble by humans; (2) SMT
components are generally more expensive than leaded components, although this disadvantage may change as SMT production techniques are perfected; (3) inspection, testing,
and rework of the circuit assemblies is generally more difficult in SMT because of the
smaller scale involved; and (4) certain types of components are not available in surface
mount form. This final limitation results in some electronic assemblies that contain both
surface-mount and leaded components.
The same basic steps are required to assemble surface-mount components to PCBs as
in pin-in-hole technology. The components must be placed on the board and soldered,
followed by cleaning, testing, and rework. The methods of placement and soldering the
components, as well as certain of the testing and rework procedures, are different in surface
mount technology. Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component
on the PCB and affixing it sufficiently to the surface until soldering provides a permanent
mechanical and electrical connection. Two alternative placement and soldering methods
are available: (1) adhesive bonding of components and wave soldering, and (2) solder
paste and reflow soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT components are more
suited to one method, whereas other types are more suited to the other.

35.4.1 ADHESIVE BONDING AND WAVE SOLDERING
The steps in this method are described in Figure 35.11. Various adhesives (Section 31.3) are
used for affixing components to the board surface. Most common are epoxies and acrylics.
The adhesive is applied by one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a
screen stencil; (2) using an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable x-y
positioning system; or (3) using a pin transfer method, in which a fixture consisting of pins
arranged according to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive
and then positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.
The components are then placed onto the board surface by automatic placement
machines operating under computer control. The term ‘‘onsertion’’ machines is used for
these units, to distinguish them from insertion machines used in PIH technology.
Onsertion machines operate at cycle rates of up to four components placed per second.
After component placement, the adhesive is cured. Depending on adhesive type,
curing is by heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, or a combination of UVand infrared (IR) radiation.

FIGURE 35.11 Adhesive bonding and wave soldering, shown here for a discrete capacitor or resistor
component: (1) adhesive is applied to areas on the board where components are to be placed; (2) components are
placed onto adhesive-coated areas; (3) adhesive is cured; and (4) solder joints are made by wave soldering.

With the surface-mount components now bonded to the PCB surface, the board is put
through wave soldering. The operation differs from its PIH counterpart in that the
components themselves pass through the molten solder wave. Technical problems sometimes encountered in SMT wave soldering include components uprooted from the board,
components shifting position, and larger components creating shadows that inhibit proper
soldering of neighboring components.

35.4.2 SOLDER PASTE AND REFLOW SOLDERING
In this method, a solder paste is used to affix components to the surface of the circuit
board. The sequence of steps is depicted in Figure 35.12.
A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder. It has three functions:
(1) it is the solder—typically 80% to 90% of total paste volume, (2) it is the flux, and (3) it is
the adhesive that secures the components to the surface of the board. Methods of applying
the solder paste to the board surface include screen printing and syringe dispensing.
Properties of the paste must be compatible with these application methods; the paste must
flow yet not be so liquid that it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied.
After solder paste application, components are placed on the board by the same type
of onsertion machines used with the adhesive bonding assembly method. A low-temperature baking operation is performed to dry the flux binder; this reduces gas escape during
soldering. Finally, the solder reflow process (Section 31.2.3) heats the solder paste
sufficiently that the solder particles melt to form a high-quality mechanical and electrical
joint between the component leads and the circuit lands on the board.
As in PIH technology, the various operations required to assemble SMT printed
circuit boards are accomplished using integrated production lines, as shown in
Figure 35.13.

35.4.3 COMBINED SMT-PIH ASSEMBLY
Our discussion of the SMTassembly methods has assumed a relatively simple circuit board
with SMT components on only one side. These cases are unusual because most SMT circuit
assemblies combine surface-mounted and pin-in-hole components on the same board. In
addition, SMT assemblies can be populated on both sides of the board, whereas PIH
components are normally limited to one side only. The assembly sequence must be altered
to allow for these additional possibilities, although the basic processing steps described in
the two preceding sections are the same.
One possibility is for the SMT and PIH components to be on the same side of the
board. For this case, a typical sequence would consist of the steps described in Figure 35.14.
More complex PCB assemblies consist of SMT-PIH components as in our figure, but with
SMT components on both sides of the board.

35.4.4 CLEANING, INSPECTION, TESTING, AND REWORK
After the components have been connected to the board, the assembly must be cleaned,
inspected for solder faults, circuit tested, and reworked if necessary.
Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difficult for surface-mounted
circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the solder
joints are smaller, and their geometries are different from joints in through-hole assemblies.
One of the problems is the way SMCs are held in place during soldering. In PIH assembly,
the components are mechanically fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly,
components are held by adhesive or paste. At soldering temperatures this method of
attachment is not as secure, and component shifting sometimes occurs. Another problem
with the smaller sizes in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between
adjacent leads, resulting in short circuits.
The smaller scale also poses problems in SMT circuit testing because less space is
available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and more
probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated. One way of
dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands whose only purpose is
to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including these test lands runs counter to
the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the board.
Manual rework in surface-mount assemblies is more difficult than in conventional
PIH assemblies, again due to the smaller component sizes. Special tools are required, such
as small-bit soldering irons, magnifying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.

35.5

ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR TECHNOLOGY
PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and these
cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables. The growing
use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical connections an
important technology. The performance of any electronic system depends on the reliability
of the individual connections linking the elements of the system together. In this section we
examine connector technology that is usually applied at the third and higher levels of
electronics packaging.

Chapter 35/Electronics Assembly and Packaging

To begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) soldering
and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 31.2 and throughout the
current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics. Pressure connections
are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to establish electrical
continuity between components. They can be divided into two types: permanent and
separable.

35.5.1 PERMANENT CONNECTIONS
A permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal surfaces, in which
one or both of the parts is mechanically deformed during the assembly process. Permanent
connection methods include crimping, press fit technology, and insulation displacement.
Crimping of Connector Terminals This connection method is used to assemble wire to
electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a permanent joint,
the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected to its mating component.
There are a variety of terminal styles, some of which are shown in Figure 35.15, and they are
available in various sizes. They all must be connected to conductor wire, and crimping is the
operation for doing this. Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal
barrel to form a permanent connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The
crimping operation squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is
performed by hand tools or crimping machines. The terminals are supplied either as individual
pieces or on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the
crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength.
Press Fit Technology Press fit in electrical connections is similar to that in mechanical
assembly, but the part configurations are different. Press fit technology is widely used in the
electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through-holes in large
PCBs. In that context, a press fit involves an interference fit between the terminal pin and
the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two categories of terminal pins:
(a) solid and (b) compliant, as in Figure 35.16. Within these categories, pin designs vary
among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross section and is designed so that its
corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated hole to form a good electrical
connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring-loaded device that conforms to the
hole contour but presses against the walls of the hole to achieve electrical contact.
Insulation Displacement Insulation displacement is a method of making a permanent
electrical connection in which a sharp, prong-shaped contact pierces the insulation and
squeezes against the wire conductor to form an electrical connection. The method is illustrated
in Figure 35.17 and is commonly used to make simultaneous connections between multiple
contacts and flat cable. The flat cable, called ribbon cable, consists of a number of parallel wires

held in a fixed arrangement by the insulation surrounding them. It is often terminated in
multiple pin connectors that are widely used in electronics to make electrical connections
between major subassemblies. In these applications, the insulation displacement method
reduces wiring errors and speeds harness assembly. To make the assembly, the cable is placed
inanestandapressisusedtodrivetheconnectorcontactsthroughtheinsulationandagainstthe
metal wires.

35.5.2 SEPARABLE CONNECTORS
Separable connections are designed to permit disassembly and reassembly; they are
meant to be connected and disconnected multiple times. When connected they must
provide metal-to-metal contact between mating components with high reliability and
low electrical resistance. Separable connection devices typically consist of multiple
contacts, contained in a plastic molded housing, designed to mate with a compatible
connector or individual wires or terminals. They are used for making electrical connections between various combinations of cables, printed circuit boards, components, and
individual wires.
A wide selection of connectors is available to serve many different applications. The
design issues in choosing among them include (1) power level (e.g., whether the connector
is used for power or signal transmission), (2) cost, (3) number of individual conductors
involved, (4) types of devices and circuits to be connected, (5) space limitations, (6) ease of
joining the connector to its leads, (7) ease of connecting with the mating terminal or
connector, and (8) frequency of connection and disconnection. Some of the principal
connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and connectors with low or
zero insertion force.

Cable connectors are devices that are permanently connected to cables (one or both
ends) and are designed to be plugged into and unplugged from a mating connector. A power
cord connector that plugs into a wall receptacle is a familiar example. Other styles include the
type of multiple pin connector and mating receptacle shown in Figure 35.18, used to provide
signal transmission between electronic subassemblies. Other multiple pin connector styles
are used to attach printed circuit boards to other subassemblies in the electronic system.
Terminal blocks consist of a series of evenly spaced receptacles that allow connections
between individual terminals or wires. The terminals or wires are often attached to the block
by means of screws or other mechanical fastening mechanisms to permit disassembly. A
conventional terminal block is illustrated in Figure 35.19.
A socket in electronics refers to a connection device mounted to a PCB, into which IC
packages and other components can be inserted. Sockets are permanently attached to the
PCB by soldering and/or press fitting, but they provide a separable connection method for
the components, which can be conveniently added, removed, or replaced in the PCB
assembly. Sockets are therefore an alternative to soldering in electronics packaging.
Insertion and withdrawal forces can be a problem in the use of pin connectors and
PCB sockets. These forces increase in proportion to the number of pins involved. Possible
damage can result when components with many contacts are assembled. This problem has
motivated the development of connectors with low insertion force (LIF) or zero insertion
force (ZIF), in which special mechanisms have been devised to reduce or eliminate the
forces required to push the positive and negative connectors together and disconnect them.

An important trend in engineering design and manufacturing is the growth in the number of products and/or
components of products whose features sizes are measured in microns (1 mm ¼ 103 mm ¼ 106 m). Several
terms have been applied to these miniaturized items. The
term microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) emphasizes the miniaturization of systems consisting of both
electronic and mechanical components. The word micromachines is sometimes used for these devices. Microsystem technology (MST) is a more general term that
refers to the products (not necessarily limited to electromechanical products) as well as the fabrication technologies to produce them. A related term is nanotechnology,
which refers to even smaller products whose dimensions
are measured in nanometers (1 nm ¼ 103 mm ¼ 109 m).
Figure 36.1 indicates the relative sizes and other factors
associated with these terms. We discuss microfabrication
techniques in the current chapter and nanofabrication in
Chapter 37.

36.1 MICROSYSTEM PRODUCTS
Designing products that are smaller and comprised of even
smaller parts and subassemblies means less material usage,
lower power requirements, greater functionality per unit
space, and accessibility to regions that are forbidden to
larger products. In most cases, smaller products should
mean lower prices because less material is used; however,
the price of a given product is influenced by the costs of
research, development, and production, and how these
costs can be spread over the number of units sold. The
economies of scale that result in lower-priced products
have not yet fully been realized in microsystems technology, except for a limited number of cases that we shall
examine in this section.

Terminology and relative sizes for microsystems and related technologies.

36.1.1 TYPES OF MICROSYSTEM DEVICES
Microsystem products can be classified by type of device (e.g., sensor, actuator) or by
application area (e.g., medical, automotive). The device categories are as follows [1]:
å Microsensors. A sensor is a device that detects or measures some physical phenomenon such as heat or pressure. It includes a transducer that converts one form of physical
variable into another form (e.g., a piezoelectric device converts mechanical force into
electrical current) plus the physical packaging and external connections. Most microsensors are fabricated on a silicon substrate using the same processing technologies as
those used for integrated circuits (Chapter 34). Microscopic-sized sensors have been
developed for measuring force, pressure, position, speed, acceleration, temperature,
flow, and a variety of optical, chemical, environmental, and biological variables. The
term hybrid microsensor is often used when the sensing element (transducer) is
combined with electronic components in the same device. Figure 36.2 shows a
micrograph of a micro-accelerometer developed at Motorola Co.

University, and M. Ali,

University.)

å Microactuators. Like a sensor, an actuator converts a physical variable of one type into
another type, but the converted variable usually involves some mechanical action (e.g., a
piezoelectric device oscillating in response to an alternating electrical field). An actuator
causes a change in position or the application of force. Examples of microactuators
include valves, positioners, switches, pumps, and rotational and linear motors [1].
å Microstructures and microcomponents. These terms are used to denote a microsized
part that is not a sensor or actuator. Examples of microstructures and microcomponents include microscopic gears, lenses, mirrors, nozzles, and beams. These items must
be combined with other components (microscopic or otherwise) to provide a useful
function. Figure 36.3 shows a microscopic gear alongside a human hair for comparison.
å Microsystems and micro-instruments. These terms denote the integration of several
of the preceding components together with the appropriate electronics package into
a miniature system or instrument. Microsystems and micro-instruments tend to be
very application specific; for example, microlasers, optical chemical analyzers, and
microspectrometers. The economics of manufacturing these kinds of systems have
tended to make commercialization difficult.

36.1.2 MICROSYSTEM APPLICATIONS
The preceding microdevices and systems have been applied in a wide variety of fields.
There are many problem areas that can be approached best using very small devices.
Some important examples are the following:
Ink-Jet Printing Heads This is currently one of the largest applications of MST, because a
typical ink-jet printer uses up several cartridges each year. The operation of an ink-jet printing
head is depicted in Figure 36.4. An array of resistance heating elements is located above a
corresponding array of nozzles. Ink is supplied by a reservoir and flows between the heaters
and nozzles. Each heating element can be independently activated under microprocessor
control in microseconds. When activated by a pulse of current, the liquid ink immediately
beneath the heater boils to form a vapor bubble, forcing ink to be expelled through the nozzle
opening. The ink hits the paper and dries almost immediately to form a dot that is part of an
alphanumeric character or other image. Meanwhile, the vapor bubble collapses, drawing
more ink from the reservoir to replenish the supply. Today’s ink-jet printers possess
resolutions of 1200 dots per inch (dpi), which converts to a nozzle separation of only about
21 mm, certainly in the microsystem range.

Thin-Film Magnetic Heads Read-write heads are key components in magnetic storage
devices. These heads were previously manufactured from horseshoe magnets that were
manually wound with insulated copper wire. Because the reading and writing of magnetic
media with higher-bit densities are limited by the size of the read-write head, hand-wound
horseshoe magnets were a limitation on the technological trend toward greater storage
densities. Development of thin-film magnetic heads at IBM Corporation was an important
breakthrough in digital storage technology as well as a significant success story for microfabrication technologies. Thin-film read-write heads are produced annually in hundreds of
millions of units, with a market of several billions of dollars per year.
A simplified sketch of the read-write head is presented in Figure 36.5, showing its
MST parts. The copper conductor coils are fabricated by electroplating copper through a
resist mold. The cross section of the coil is about 2 to 3 mm on a side. The thin-film cover,
only a few mm thick, is made of nickel–iron alloy. The miniature size of the read-write head
has permitted the significant increases in bit densities of magnetic storage media. The small
sizes are made possible by microfabrication technologies.
Compact Discs Compact discs (CDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs)1 are important
commercial products today, as storage media for audio, video, games, and computer software

games, and high-quality audio.

and data applications. A CD disk is molded of polycarbonate (Section 8.2), which has ideal
optical and mechanical properties for the application. The disk is 120 mm in diameter and
1.2 mm thick. The data consist of small pits (depressions) in a helical track that begins at a
diameter of 46 mm and ends at about 117 mm. The tracks in the spiral are separated by about
1.6 mm. Each pit in the track is about 0.5 mm wide and about 0.8 mm to 3.5 mm long. These
dimensions certainly qualify CDs as products of microsystem technology. The corresponding
dimensions of DVDs are even smaller, permitting much higher data storage capacities.
Although most of the microfabrication processes are discussed in Section 36.2, let us
briefly describe the production sequence for CDs here, because it is rather unique and uses
several processes that are quite conventional. As consumer products, music CDs are massproduced by plastic injection molding (Section 13.6). To make the mold, a master is created
from a smooth, thin layer of positive photoresist coated onto a 300-mm diameter glass plate.
A modulated laser beam writes the data onto the photoresist by exposing microscopic regions
on the surface as the plate is rotated and moved slowly and precisely to create the spiral track.
When the photoresist is developed, the exposed regions are removed. These regions in the
master will correspond to the pits in the CD. A thin layer of nickel is then deposited onto the
surface of the master by sputtering (Section 28.5.1). Electroforming (Section 28.3.2) is then
used to build up the thickness of the nickel (to several mm), thus creating a negative
impression of the master. This is called the ‘‘father’’. Several impressions are made of the
father by the same electroforming process, in effect creating a negative impression of the
father, whose surface geometry is identical to the original glass plate master. These impressions are called ‘‘mothers’’. Finally, the mothers are used to create the actual mold impressions (called ‘‘stampers’’), again by electroforming, and these are used to mass-produce the
CDs.2 The process sequence is similar for DVDs but more involved because of the smaller
scale and different data format requirements.
Once molded, the pitted side of the polycarbonate disk is coated with aluminum by
sputtering to create a mirror surface. To protect this layer, a thin polymer coating (e.g.,
acrylic) is deposited onto the metal. Thus, the final compact disk is a sandwich with a
relatively thick polycarbonate substrate on one side, a thin polymer layer on the other side,
and in between a very thin layer of aluminum. In subsequent operation, the laser beam of a
CD player (or other data reader) is directed through the polycarbonate substrate onto the
reflective surface, and the reflected beam is interpreted as a sequence of binary digits.
Automotive Microsensors and other microdevices are widely used in modern automotive
products. Use of these microsystems is consistent with the increased application of on-board
electronics to accomplish control and safety functions for the vehicle. The functions include
electronic engine control, cruise control, anti-lock braking systems, air-bag deployment,
automatic transmission control, power steering, all-wheel drive, automatic stability control,
on-board navigation systems, and remote locking and unlocking, not to mention air conditioning and radio. These control systems and safety features require sensors and actuators,
and a growing number of these are microscopic in size. There are currently 20 to 100 sensors
installed in a modern automobile, depending on make and model. In 1970 there were virtually
no on-board sensors. Some specific on-board microsensors are listed in Table 36.1.
Medical Opportunities for using microsystems technology in this area are tremendous.
Indeed, significant strides have already been made, and many of the traditional medical and
2

The reason for the rather involved mold-making sequence is because the pitted surfaces of the
impressions degrade after multiple uses. A father can be used to make three to six mothers, and each
mother can be used to make three to six stampers, before their respective surfaces become degraded. A
stamper (mold) can be used to produce only a few thousand disks, so if the production run is for several
hundred thousand CDs, more than one stamper must be used during the run to produce all high-quality
CDs.

surgical methods have already been transformed by MST. One of the driving forces behind
the use of microscopic devices is the principle of minimal-invasive therapy, which involves the
use of very small incisions or even available body orifices to access the medical problem of
concern. Advantages of this approach over the use of relatively large surgical incisions
include less patient discomfort, quicker recovery, fewer and smaller scars, shorter hospital
stays, and lower health insurance costs.
Among the techniques based on miniaturization of medical instrumentation is the field
of endoscopy,3 now routinely used for diagnostic purposes and with growing applications in
surgery. It is standard medical practice today to use endoscopic examination accompanied by
laparoscopic surgery for hernia repair and removal of organs such as gall bladder and
appendix. Growing use of similar procedures is expected in brain surgery, operating through
one or more small holes drilled through the skull.
Other applications of MST in the medical field now include or are expected to include
(1) angioplasty, in which damaged blood vessels and arteries are repaired using surgery,
lasers, or miniaturized inflatable balloons at the end of a catheter that is inserted into the
vein; (2) telemicrosurgery, in which a surgical operation is performed remotely using a
stereo microscope and microscopic surgical tools; (3) artificial prostheses, such as heart
pacemakers and hearing aids; (4) implantable sensor systems to monitor physical variables
in the human body such as blood pressure and temperature; (5) drug delivery devices that
can be swallowed by a patient and then activated by remote control at the exact location
intended for treatment, such as the intestine, and (6) artificial eyes.
Chemical and Environmental A principal role of microsystem technology in chemical
and environmental applications is the analysis of substances to measure trace amounts of
chemicals or detect harmful contaminants. A variety of chemical microsensors have been
developed. They are capable of analyzing very small samples of the substance of interest.
Micropumps are sometimes integrated into these systems so that the proper amounts of the
substance can be delivered to the sensor component.
Other Applications There are many other applications of microsystem technology
beyond those described in the preceding. We list some examples in the following:

The use of a small instrument (i.e., an endoscope) to visually examine the inside of a hollow body organ
such as the rectum or colon.

å Scanning probe microscope. This is a technology for measuring microscopic details of
surfaces, allowing surface structures to be examined at the nanometer level. In order to
operate in this dimensional range, the instruments require probes that are only a few
mm in length and that scan the surface at a distance measured in nm. These probes are
produced using microfabrication techniques.4
å Biotechnology. In biotechnology, the specimens of interest are often microscopic in
size. To study these specimens, manipulators and other tools are needed that are of the
same size scale. Microdevices are being developed for holding, moving, sorting,
dissecting, and injecting the small samples of biomaterials under a microscope.
å Electronics. Printed circuit board (PCB) and connector technologies are discussed in
Chapter 35, but they should also be cited here in the context of MST. Miniaturization
trends in electronics have forced PCBs, contacts, and connectors to be fabricated with
smaller and more complex physical details, and with mechanical structures that are
more consistent with the microdevices discussed in this chapter than with the integrated circuits discussed in Chapter 34.

36.2

MICROFABRICATION PROCESSES
Many of the products in microsystem technology are based on silicon, and most of the
processing techniques used in the fabrication of microsystems are borrowed from the microelectronics industry. There are several important reasons why silicon is a desirable material in
MST: (1) The microdevices in MSToften include electronic circuits, so both the circuit and the
microdevice can be fabricated in combination on the same substrate. (2) In addition to its
desirable electronic properties, silicon also possesses useful mechanical properties, such as
high strength and elasticity, good hardness, and relatively low density.5 (3) The technologies
for processing silicon are well-established, owing to their widespread use in microelectronics.
(4) Use of single-crystal silicon permits the production of physical features to very close
tolerances.
Microsystem technology often requires silicon to be fabricated along with other
materials to obtain a particular microdevice. For example, microactuators often consist of
several components made of different materials. Accordingly, microfabrication techniques
consist of more than just silicon processing. Our coverage of the microfabrication processes
is organized into three sections: (1) silicon layering processes, (2) the LIGA process, and
(3) other processes accomplished on a microscopic scale.

36.2.1 SILICON LAYER PROCESSES
The first application of silicon in microsystems technology was in the fabrication of
Si piezoresistive sensors for the measurement of stress, strain, and pressure in the early
1960s [5]. Silicon is now widely used in MST to produce sensors, actuators, and other
microdevices. The basic processing technologies are those used to produce integrated
circuits (Chapter 34). However, it should be noted that certain differences exist between the
processing of ICs and the fabrication of the microdevices covered in this chapter:
1. The aspect ratios in microfabrication are generally much greater than in IC fabrication. Aspect ratio is defined as the height-to-width ratio of the features produced, as
illustrated in Figure 36.6. Typical aspect ratios in semiconductor processing are about

1.0 or less, whereas in microfabrication the corresponding ratio might be as high as
400 [5].
2. The sizes of the devices made in microfabrication are often much larger than in IC
processing, where the prevailing trend in microelectronics is inexorably toward greater
circuit densities and miniaturization.
3. The structures produced in microfabrication often include cantilevers and bridges and
other shapes requiring gaps between layers. These kinds of structures are uncommon in
IC fabrication.
4. The silicon processing techniques are sometimes supplemented to obtain a threedimensional structure or other physical feature in the microsystem.
Notwithstanding these differences, let us nevertheless recognize that most of the
silicon-processing steps used in microfabrication are the same or very similar to those used
to produce ICs. After all, silicon is the same material whether it is used for integrated
circuits or microdevices. The processing steps are listed in Table 36.2, together with brief
descriptions and text references in which the reader can obtain more detailed descriptions.
All of these process steps are discussed in previous chapters. As in IC fabrication, the
various processes in Table 36.2 add, alter, or remove layers of material from a substrate
according to geometric data contained in lithographic masks. Lithography is the fundamental technology that determines the shape of the microdevice being fabricated.
Regarding our preceding list of differences between IC fabrication and microdevice
fabrication, the issue of aspect ratio should be addressed in more detail. The structures in IC
processing are basically planar, whereas three-dimensional structures are more likely to be
required in microsystems. The features of microdevices are likely to possess large height-towidth ratios. These 3-D features can be produced in single-crystal silicon by wet etching,
provided the crystal structure is oriented to allow the etching process to proceed anisotropically. Chemical wet etching of polycrystalline silicon is isotropic, with the formation of
cavities under the edges of the resist, as illustrated in Figure 34.13. However, in singlecrystal Si, the etching rate depends on the orientation of the lattice structure. In Figure 36.7,
the three crystal faces of silicon’s cubic lattice structure are illustrated. Certain etching
solutions, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), have a very
low etching rate in the direction of the (111) crystal face. This permits the formation of
distinct geometric structures with sharp edges in a single-crystal Si substrate whose lattice is
oriented to favor etch penetration vertically or at sharp angles into the substrate. Structures

such as those in Figure 36.8 can be created using this procedure. It should be noted that
anisotropic wet etching is also desirable in IC fabrication (Section 34.4.5), but its consequence is greater in microfabrication because of the larger aspect ratios. The term bulk
micromachining is used for the relatively deep wet etching process into single-crystal
silicon substrate (Si wafer); whereas the term surface micromachining refers to the planar
structuring of the substrate surface, using much more shallow layering processes.
Bulk micromachining can be used to create thin membranes in a microstructure.
However, a method is needed to control the etching penetration into the silicon, so as to
leave the membrane layer. A common method used for this purpose is to dope the silicon
substrate with boron atoms, which significantly reduce the etching rate of the silicon. The

processing sequence is shown in Figure 36.9. In step (2), epitaxial deposition is used to apply
the upper layer of silicon so that it will possess the same single-crystal structure and lattice
orientation as the substrate (Section 34.4.2). This is a requirement of bulk micromachining
that will be used to provide the deeply etched region in subsequent processing. The use of
boron doping to establish the etch resistant layer of silicon is called the p+etch-stop
technique.
Surface micromachining can be used to construct cantilevers, overhangs, and similar
structures on a silicon substrate, as shown in part (5) of Figure 36.10. The cantilevered
beams in the figure are parallel to but separated by a gap from the silicon surface. Gap size
and beam thickness are in the micron range. The process sequence to fabricate this type of
structure is depicted in the earlier parts of Figure 36.10.
Dry etching, which involves material removal through the physical and/or chemical
interaction between the ions in an ionized gas (plasma) and the atoms of a surface that has
been exposed to the ionized gas (Section 34.4.5), provides anisotropic etching in almost any
material. Its anisotropic penetration characteristic is not limited to a single-crystal silicon
substrate. On the other hand, etch selectivity is more of a problem in dry etching; that is, any
surfaces exposed to the plasma are attacked.
A procedure called the lift-off technique is used in microfabrication to pattern
metals such as platinum on a substrate. These structures are used in certain chemical

technique is illustrated in Figure 36.11.

36.2.2 LIGA PROCESS
LIGA is an important process in MST. It was developed in Germany in the early 1980s. The
letters LIGA stand for the German words LIthographie (in particular, x-ray lithography,
although other lithographic exposure methods are also used, such as ion beams in
Figure 36.3), Galvanoformung (translated electrodeposition or electroforming), and
Abformtechnik (plastic molding). The letters also indicate the LIGA processing sequence.
These processing steps have each been described in previous sections of our book: x-ray
lithography in Section 35.3.2; electrodeposition and electroforming in Sections 28.3.1 and
28.3.2, respectively; and plastic molding processes in Sections 13.6 and 13.7. Let us examine
how they are integrated in LIGA technology.
The LIGA processing steps are illustrated in Figure 36.12. Let us elaborate on the brief
description provided in the figure’s caption: (1) A thick layer of (x-ray) radiation-sensitive
resist is applied to a substrate. Layer thickness can range between several microns to
centimeters, depending on the size of the part(s) to be produced. The common resist
material used in LIGA is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, Section 8.2.2 under
‘‘Acrylics’’). The substrate must be a conductive material for the subsequent electrodeposition processes performed. The resist is exposed through a mask to high-energy x-ray
radiation. (2) The irradiated areas of the positive resist are chemically removed from the
substrate surface, leaving the unexposed portions standing as a three-dimensional plastic
structure. (3) The regions where the resist has been removed are filled with metal using
electrodeposition. Nickel is the common plating metal used in LIGA. (4) The remaining
resist structure is stripped (removed), yielding a three-dimensional metal structure.

Depending on the geometry created, this metallic structure may be (a) the mold used for
producing plastic parts by injection molding, reaction injection molding, or compression
molding. In the case of injection molding, in which thermoplastic parts are produced, these
parts may be used as ‘‘lost molds’’ in investment casting (Section 11.2.4). Alternatively,
(b) the metal part may be a pattern for fabricating plastic molds that will be used to
produce more metallic parts by electrodeposition.
As our description indicates, LIGA can produce parts by several different methods.
This is one of the greatest advantages of this microfabrication process: (1) LIGA is a versatile
process. Other advantages include (2) high aspect ratios are possible—large height-towidth ratios in the fabricated part; (3) wide range of part sizes is feasible, with heights
ranging from micrometers to centimeters; and (4) close tolerances can be achieved. A
significant disadvantage of LIGA is that it is a very expensive process, so large quantities of
parts are usually required to justify its application. Also, the required use of x-ray radiation
is a disadvantage.

36.2.3 OTHER MICROFABRICATION PROCESSES
MST research is providing several additional fabrication techniques, most of which are
variations of lithography or adaptations of macro-scale processes. In this section we
discuss several of these additional techniques.
Soft Lithography This term is used for processes that use an elastomeric flat mold
(similar to a rubber ink stamp) to create a pattern on a substrate surface. The sequence for
creating the mold is illustrated in Figure 36.13. A master pattern is fabricated on a silicon
surface using one of the lithography processes such as UV photolithography or electron
beam lithography. This master pattern is then used to produce the flat mold for the soft
lithography process. The common mold material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, a silicon
rubber, Section 8.4.3). After the PDMS has cured, it is peeled away from the pattern and
attached to a substrate for support and handling.

FIGURE 36.13 Steps in mold-making for soft lithography: (1) master pattern fabricated by traditional lithography,
(2) polydimethylsiloxane flat mold is cast from the master pattern, and (3) cured flat mold is peeled off pattern for use.

Two of the soft lithography processes are micro-imprint lithography and micro-contact
printing. In micro-imprint lithography, the mold is pressed into the surface of a soft resist to
displace the resist away from certain regions of the substrate for subsequent etching. The
process sequence is illustrated in Figure 36.14. The flat mold consists of raised and depressed
regions, and the raised regions correspond to areas on the resist surface that will be displaced
to expose the substrate. The resist material is a thermoplastic polymer that has been softened
by heating before pressing. The alteration of the resist layer is by mechanical deformation
rather than electromagnetic radiation, as in the more traditional lithography methods. The
compressed regions of the resist layer are subsequently removed by anisotropic etching
(Section 34.4.5). The etching process also reduces the thickness of the remaining resist layer,
but enough remains to protect the substrate for subsequent processing. Micro-imprint
lithography can be set up for high production rates at modest cost. A mask is not required
in the imprint procedure, although the mold requires an analogous preparation.
The same type of flat stamp can be used in a printing mode, in which case the process
is called micro-contact printing. In this form of soft lithography, the mold is used to transfer
a pattern of a substance to a substrate surface, much like ink can be transferred to a paper
surface. This process allows very thin layers to be fabricated onto the substrate.
Nontraditional and Traditional Processes in Microfabrication A number of nontraditional machining processes (Chapter 26), as well as conventional manufacturing
processes, are important in microfabrication. Photochemical machining (PCM, Section
26.4.2) is an essential process in IC processing and microfabrication, but we have referred to
it in our descriptions here and in Chapter 34 as wet chemical etching (combined with
photolithography). PCM is often used with conventional processes of electroplating,
electroforming, and/or electroless plating (Section 28.3) to add layers of metallic materials
according to microscopic pattern masks.

Other nontraditional processes capable of micro-level processing include [5]:
(1) electric discharge machining, used to cut holes as small as 0.3 mm in diameter
with aspect ratios (depth-to-diameter) as high as 100; (2) electron-beam machining, for
cutting holes of diameter smaller than 100 mm in hard-to-machine materials; (3) laserbeam machining, which can produce complex profiles and holes as small as 10 mm in
diameter with aspect ratios (depth-to-width or depth-to-diameter) approaching 50;
(4) ultrasonic machining, capable of drilling holes in hard and brittle materials as small
as 50 mm in diameter; and (5) wire electric discharge cutting, or wire-EDM, which can cut
very narrow swaths with aspect ratios (depth-to-width) greater than 100.
Trends in conventional machining have included its capabilities for taking smaller
and smaller cut sizes and associated tolerances. Referred to as ultra-high-precision
machining, the enabling technologies have included single-crystal diamond cutting tools
and position control systems with resolutions as fine as 0.01 mm [5]. Figure 36.15 depicts one
reported application, the milling of grooves in aluminum foil using a single-point diamond
fly-cutter. The aluminum foil is 100 mm thick, and the grooves are 85 mm wide and 70 mm
deep. Similar ultra-high-precision machining is being applied today to produce products
such as computer hard discs, photocopier drums, mold inserts for compact disk reader
heads, and high-definition TV projection lenses.
Rapid Prototyping Technologies Several rapid prototyping (RP) methods (Chapter
33) have been adapted to produce micro-sized parts [7]. RP methods use a layer additive
approach to build three-dimensional components, based on a CAD (computer-aided
design) geometric model of the component. Each layer is very thin, typically as low as
0.05 mm thick, which approaches the scale of microfabrication technologies. By making
the layers even thinner, microcomponents can be fabricated.
One approach is called electrochemical fabrication (EFAB), which involves the
electrochemical deposition of metallic layers in specific areas that are determined by
pattern masks created by ‘‘slicing’’ a CAD model of the object to be made (Section 33.1).
The deposited layers are generally 5 to 10 mm thick, with feature sizes as small as 20 mm in
width. EFAB is carried out at temperatures below 60 C (140 F) and does not require a
clean room environment. However, the process is slow, requiring about 40 minutes to apply
each layer, or about 36 layers (a height between 180 and 360 mm) per 24-hour period. To
overcome this disadvantage, the mask for each layer can contain multiple copies of the part
slice pattern, permitting many parts to be produced simultaneously in a batch process.

Review Questions

Another RP approach, called microstereolithography, is based on stereolithography
(STL, Section 33.2.1), but the scale of the processing steps is reduced in size. Whereas the
layer thickness in conventional stereolithography ranges between 75 mm and 500 mm,
microstereolithography (MSTL) uses layer thicknesses between 10 and 20 mm typically,
with even thinner layers possible. The laser spot size in STL is typically around 250 mm in
diameter, whereas MSTL uses a spot size as small as 1 or 2 mm. Another difference in MSTL
is that the work material is not limited to a photosensitive polymer. Researchers report
success in fabricating 3-D microstructures from ceramic and metallic materials. The
difference is that the starting material is a powder rather than a liquid.
Photofabrication This term applies to an industrial process in which ultraviolet exposure
through a pattern mask causes a significant modification in the chemical solubility of an
optically clear material. The change is manifested in the form of an increase in solubility to
certain etchants. For example, hydrofluoric acid etches the UV-exposed photosensitive glass
between 15 and 30 times faster than the same glass that has not been exposed. Masking is not
required during etching, the difference in solubility being the determining factor in which
portions of the glass are removed.
Origination of photofabrication actually preceded the microprocessing of silicon.
Now, with the growing interest in microfabrication technologies, there is a renewed interest
in the older technology. Examples of modern materials used in photofabrication include
Corning Glass Works’ FotoformTM glasses and FotoceramTM ceramics, and DuPont’s Dycril
and Templex photosensitive solid polymers. When processing these materials, aspect ratios
of around 3:1 can be obtained with the polymers and 20:1 with the glasses and ceramics.

The trend in miniaturization is continuing beyond the micrometer range into the nanometer (nm) scale. Nanotechnology
referstothefabricationandapplicationofentitieswhosefeature
sizes range from less than 1 nm to 100 nm (1 nm ¼ 103 mm ¼
106 mm ¼ 109 m).1 The entities include films, coatings, dots,
lines, wires, tubes, structures, and systems. The prefix nano is
used for these items; thus, we have new words such as nanotube,
nanostructure, nanoscale, and nanoscience entering our vocabulary. Nanoscience is the field of scientific study that is concerned with objects in the same size range. Nanoscale refers to
dimensions within this range and slightly below, which overlaps
on the lower end with the sizes of atoms and molecules. For
example, the smallest atom is Helium, with a diameter close to
0.1 nm. Uranium has a diameter of about 0.22 nm and is the
largest of the naturally occurring atoms. Molecules tend to be
larger because they consist of multiple atoms. Molecules made
up of about 30 atoms are roughly 1 nm in size, depending on the
elements involved. Thus, nanoscience involves the behavior of
individual molecules and the principles that explain this behavior, and nanotechnology involves the application of these principles to create useful products.
In the previous chapter, we provided an overview of
the products and devices in microsystem technology. Let us
do the same for nanotechnology. What are the currently
available and potential future products and materials?
Nanotechnology involves not just a reduction in scale by
three orders of magnitude. The science is different when
the sizes of the entities approach the molecular and atomic
levels. We discuss some of these differences in Section 37.2.
Finally, in Section 37.3, we describe the major categories of
fabrication processes used in nanotechnology.

The dividing line between nanotechnology and microsystem technology (Chapter 36) is considered to be 100 nm ¼ 0.1 mm [7]. This is
illustrated approximately in Figure 36.1.

37.1 NANOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Most products in nanotechnology are not just smaller versions of microsystem technology
(MST) products; they also include new materials, coatings, and unique entities that are not
included within the scope of MST. Nanoscale products and processes that have been around
for a while include the following:
å The colorful stained-glass windows of churches built during the Middle Ages were
based on gold particles of nanometer scale embedded in the glass. Depending on
their size, the particles can take on a variety of different colors.
å Modern photography has roots dating back more than 150 years and depends on the
formation of silver nanoparticles to create the image in the photograph.
å Nanoscale particles of carbon are used as reinforcing fillers in automobile tires.
å Catalytic converters required in the exhaust systems of modern automobiles make use of
nanoscale coatings of platinum and palladium on a ceramic honeycomb structure. The
metal coatings act as catalysts to convert harmful emission gases into harmless gases.
We should also mention that the fabrication technology for integrated circuits now includes
feature sizes that are in the nanotech range. Of course, integrated circuits have been produced
since the 1960s, but only in recent years have nanoscale features been achieved.
Other more recent products exploiting applications of nanotechnology include
cosmetics, sun lotions, car polishes and waxes, coatings for eyeglass lenses, and scratchresistant paints. All of these categories contain nanoscale particles (nanoparticles), which
qualifies them as products of nanotechnology. A more complete list of examples of present
and future products and materials based on nanotechnology is presented in Table 37.1. For
TABLE 37.1

Examples of present and future products and materials that are based on nanotechnology.

Computers. Carbon nanotubes (Section 37.1.3) are strong candidates to substitute for silicon-based electronics as the
limits of size reduction are approached in the lithography-based processes used to make integrated circuits on
silicon wafers. These limits are expected to be reached around the year 2015.
Materials. Nanoscale particles (nanodots) and fibers (nanowires) may prove to be useful reinforcing agents for
composite materials. For example, the truck bed for one of General Motors’ Hummer vehicles is made with
nanocomposites. Entirely new material systems, not known today, may be possible with nanotechnology.
Nanoparticle catalysts. Metal nanoparticles and coatings of noble metals (e.g., gold, platinum) on ceramic substrates
act as catalysts for certain chemical reactions. Catalytic converters in automobiles are an important example.
Cancer drugs. Nanoscale drugs are being developed that will be designed to match the specific genetic profile of the
cancer cells of a patient and to attack and destroy the cells. For example, Abraxine is a nanoscale protein-based
medicine produced by American Pharmaceutical that is used to treat metastatic breast cancer.
Solar energy. Nanoscale surface films have the potential to absorb more of the sun’s electromagnetic energy than existing
photovoltaic receptacles. Developments in this area may reduce our reliance on fossil fuels for power generation.
Coatings. Nanoscale coatings and ultra-thin films are being developed that will increase scratch resistance of surfaces
(eyeglass lenses with such coatings are already available), stain resistance of fabrics, and self-cleaning capabilities
for windows and other surfaces (the ‘‘lotus effect’’).
Flat screen displays for television and computer monitors. TV screens based on carbon nanotubes are being
introduced. They are expected to be brighter, less expensive, and more energy efficient than current displays. They
will be produced by Samsung Electronics of South Korea.
Portable medical laboratories. Instruments based on nanotechnology will provide fast analysis of a variety of
ailments such as diabetes and HIV.
Batteries. Carbon nanotubes may be future components in high-powered batteries and storage devices for hydrogen.
Hydrogen storage will no doubt play a role in converting from fossil-fuel motors to hydrogen-based engines.
Light sources. Lamps are being developed based on nanotechnology that use a fraction of the energy of an
incandescent light bulb and never burn out.

an extensive list of nanotech products, the interested reader can consult www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer [27].
An important product category in microsystem technology is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which have found quite a few applications in the computer,
medical, and automotive industries (Section 36.1.2). With the advent of nanotechnology,
there has been growing interest in the notion of extending the development of these
kinds of devices into the nanoscale range. Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are
the sub-micron sized counterparts of MEMS devices, only their smaller sizes would
result in even greater potential advantages. An important NEMS structural product
currently produced is the probe used in atomic force microscopes (Section 37.2.2). The
sharp point on the probe is of nanoscale size. Nanosensors are another developing
application. Nanosensors would be more accurate, faster responding, and operate with
lower power requirements than larger sensors. Current NEMS sensor applications
include accelerometers and chemical sensors. It has been suggested that multiple
nanosensors could be distributed throughout the subject area to collect data, thus
providing the benefit of multiple readings of the variable of interest, rather than using a
single larger sensor at one location.
Formidable technical problems arise in applications of nanomachines, defined as
nanosystems consisting of movable parts and at least two different materials [7]. The
problems result from the fact that the part surfaces cannot be made smooth at the atomic
and molecular sizes. Other surface characteristics also come into play, as discussed in
Section 37.2.1.

37.1.1 CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES
Two structures of significant scientific and commercial interest in nanotechnology are
carbon buckyballs and nanotubes. They are basically graphite layers that have been
formed into spheres and tubes, respectively.
The name buckyball refers to the molecule C60, which contains exactly 60 carbon
atoms and is shaped like a soccer ball, as in Figure 37.1. The original name of the
molecule was buckministerfullerene, after the architect/inventor R. Buckminister
Fuller, who designed the geodesic dome that resembles the C60 structure. Today,
C60 is simply called a fullerene, which refers to any closed hollow carbon molecules
that consist of 12 pentagonal and various numbers of hexagonal faces. In the case of

molecule. (Reprinted by

Chapter 37/Nanofabrication Technologies

C60, the 60 atoms are arranged symmetrically into 12 pentagonal faces and 20
hexagonal faces to form a ball. These molecular balls can be bonded together by
van der Waals forces (Section 2.2) to form crystals whose lattice structure is facecentered cubic (Figure 2.8(b), Section 2.3.1). The separation between any molecule
and its closest neighbor in the C60 lattice structure is 1 nm.
Fullerenes are of interest for a number of reasons. One is their electrical properties
and the capability to alter these properties. A C60 crystal has the properties of an insulator.
However, when doped with an alkaline metal such as potassium (forming K3C60), it is
transformed into an electrical conductor. Moreover, it exhibits properties of a superconductor at temperatures of around 18 K. Another potential application area for the C60
fullerenes is in the medical field. The C60 molecule has many possible attachment points for
focused drug treatments. Other possible medical applications for buckyballs include
antioxidants, burn creams, and diagnostic imaging.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are another molecular structure consisting of carbon
atoms bonded together in the shape of a long tube. The atoms can be arranged into a
number of alternative configurations, three of which are illustrated in Figure 37.2. The
nanotubes shown in the figure are all single-walled nanotubes (SWNT), but multi-walled
structures (MWNT) can also be fabricated, which are tubes within a tube. A SWNT has a
typical diameter of a few nanometers (down to 1 nm) and a length of around 100 nm, and it
is closed at both ends.
The electrical properties of nanotubes are unusual. Depending on the structure and
diameter, nanotubes can have metallic (conducting) or semiconducting properties.
Conductivity of metallic nanotubes can be superior to that of copper by six orders of
magnitude [7]. The explanation for this is that nanotubes contain few of the defects
existing in metals that tend to scatter electrons, thus increasing electrical resistance.
Because nanotubes have such low resistance, high currents do not increase their

temperature the way metals heat up under the same electrical loads. Thermal conductivity of metallic nanotubes is also very high. These electrical and thermal properties are
of significant interest to manufacturers of computers and integrated circuits because they
may allow higher clock speeds of processors without the heat buildup problems currently
encountered as the density of components on a silicon chip increases. Clock speeds 104
times faster than current-day processors may be possible [17], along with much higher
densities.
Another electrical property of carbon nanotubes is field emission, in which electrons
are emitted from the ends of the tubes at very high rates when an electrical field is applied
parallel to the axis of a nanotube. The possible commercial applications of field emission
properties of nanotubes include flat panel displays for televisions and computer monitors.
Mechanical properties are another reason for the interest in single-walled nanotubes.
Compared with steel, density is only 1/6, modulus of elasticity is five times higher, and
tensile strength is 100 times greater [7]. Yet, when SWNTs are bent, they exhibit great
resilience to return to their previous shape without damage. These mechanical properties
present opportunities for using them in applications ranging from reinforcing materials in
polymer matrix composites (Section 9.4) to fiber cloths in bulletproof vests. Ironically,
multi-walled nanotubes are not as strong.

37.1.2 THE NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE
In the year 2000, a national initiative on nanotechnology was enacted by the U.S. Congress
at a funding level of $400 million starting in 2001. Funding levels have increased in what is
now called the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). A total of $3.7 billion was
allocated over the 4-year period starting in 2005, making it the largest federally funded
R&D program since the Apollo Space Program. The NNI Act mandated the coordination
of nanotechnology research and development activities in the various federal agencies that
are involved in this technology, including the Departments of Defense and Energy, the
National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Standards
and Technology, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In addition, the
Act defined nine areas of nanotechnology development (referred to as the NNI Grand
Challenges) that will affect the lives of virtually all U.S. citizens. Table 37.2 briefly describes
the nine areas of nanotechnology development to provide an overview of the future
opportunities envisioned for this technology.

37.2

INTRODUCTION TO NANOSCIENCE
The fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology are interdisciplinary. They rely on the
synergistic contributions of chemistry, physics, various engineering disciplines, and computer science. The fields of biology and medical science are also involved. Biology operates
in the nanoscale range. Proteins, basic substances in living organisms, are large molecules
ranging in size between about 4 nm and 50 nm. Proteins are made up of amino acids
(organic acids containing the amino group NH2), whose molecular size is about 0.5 nm.
Each protein molecule consists of combinations of various amino acid molecules2 connected together to form a long chain (a nanowire). This long macromolecule twists and
turns to compact itself into a mass with a cross section in the 4- to 50-nm range. Other

2

There are more than 100 different amino acids that occur naturally, but most of the proteins found in
living organisms consist of only 20 of these amino acid types.

Compiled from [14].

biological entities of nanoscale size include chlorophyll molecules in plants (about 1 nm),
hemoglobin in blood (7 nm), and flu viruses (60 nm). Biological cells are orders of
magnitude larger. For example, a red blood cell is disk-shaped with diameter of about
8000 nm (8 mm) and thickness of about 1500 nm (1.5 mm). The diameter of the human hair
shown in Figure 36.3 is approximately 100,000 nm (0.1 mm).
Our focus in this chapter is on nanoscale entities that are nonbiological. As in biology,
nanotechnology deals with objects that are not much bigger than the atoms and molecules
that comprise them. In Section 37.2.1, we discuss these ‘‘size effects’’ and how material
properties are affected when the dimensions of an entity are measured in nanometers. The
inability to ‘‘see’’ nanoscale objects has inhibited developments in nanotechnology until

E1C37

17:58:44

Page 875

Section 37.2/Introduction to Nanoscience

875

recently. The advent of scanning probe microscopes in the 1980s has allowed objects at the
molecular level to be visualized and measured. These types of microscopes are described in
Section 37.2.2.

37.2.1 SIZE MATTERS
One of the physical effects that occurs with very small objects is that their surface properties
become much more important relative to their bulk properties. Consider the surface-tovolume ratio of a given amount of material as its dimensions are changed. Let us start with a
cubic block of material that is 1 m on each side. Its total surface area is 6 m2, and its volume is
1 m3, giving it a surface-to-volume ratio of 6-to-1. If that same volume of material were now
compressed into a flat square plate that is 1 mm thick (0.00004 in, or about 1/100 the diameter
of a human hair), its dimensions would be 1000 m on each side, and its total surface area (top,
bottom, and edges) would be 2,000,000.004 m2 (1000  1000 m2 on each of two sides, plus
0.001 m2 on each of the four edges). This would give it a surface-to-volume ratio of slightly
greater than 2,000,000-to-1.
Next, suppose the flat plate were sliced in two directions to create cubes that are
1 mm  1 mm  1 mm. The total number of cubes would be 1018, and the surface area of each
cube would be 6 mm2 or 6(1012) m2. Multiplying the surface area of each cube by the
number of cubes gives a total surface area of 6,000,000 m2, or a surface-to-volume ratio of
6,000,000-to-1 for the original amount of material.
A cube that is 1 mm on each side is surely small, but in nanometers, it is 1000 nm on each
edge. Suppose the molecules of this material are cube-shaped, and from our earlier discussion,
each molecule measures 1-nm on a side (admittedly, the molecular cube shape is a stretch, but
the 1-nm size is plausible). This means that the 1-mm cube contains 109 molecules, of which
6(106) are on the surface of the cube. This leaves 109 – 6(106) ¼ 994(106) molecules that are
internal (beneath the surface). The ratio of internal to surface molecules is 994-to-6 or 165.667to-1. By comparison, the same ratio for a cube with 1 m on a side is about 1027-to-1. As the size
of the cube decreases, the ratio of internal-to-surface molecules continues to get smaller and
smaller, until finally, we have a cube that is 1 nm on a side (the size of the molecule itself), and
there are no internal molecules. What this numerical exercise demonstrates is that as the size
of an object decreases, approaching nanometer dimensions, the surface molecules become
increasingly important relative to the internal molecules simply because of their increasing
numerical proportion. Thus, the surface properties of the materials out of which nanometersized objects are made become more influential in determining the behavior of the objects,
and the relative influence of the bulk properties of the material is reduced.
Recall from Section 2.2 that there are two types of atomic bonding: (1) primary bonds
that are generally associated with combining atoms into molecules, and (2) secondary
bonds that attract molecules together to form bulk materials. One of the implications of the
large surface-to-volume ratio of nanoscale objects is that the secondary bonds that exist
between molecules assume greater importance because the shape and properties of an
object not much bigger than the molecules comprising it tend to depend on these secondary
bonding forces. Accordingly, the material properties and behaviors of nanoscale structures
are different from those of structures with dimensions in the macroscale or even microscale.
These differences can sometimes be exploited to create materials and products with
improved electronic, magnetic, and/or optical properties. Two examples of recently
developed materials in this category are (1) carbon nanotubes (Section 37.1.1), and
(2) magnetoresistive materials for use in high-density magnetic memories. Nanotechnology
will enable the development of entirely new classes of materials.
Another difference that arises between nanoscale objects and their macroscopic
counterparts is that material behavior tends to be influenced by quantum mechanics rather
than bulk properties. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that is concerned with the

E1C37

Chapter 37/Nanofabrication Technologies

notion that all forms of energy (e.g., electricity, light) occur in discrete units or packets when
observed on a small enough scale. The discrete units or packets are called quanta (plural of
quantum), which cannot be further subdivided. For example, electricity is conducted in
units of electrons. An electrical charge of less than one electron is not possible. In light
energy, the quanta are photons. In magnetic energy, they are called magnons. For every
type of energy there are comparable units. All physical phenomena exhibit quantum
behavior at the submicroscopic level. On a macroscopic level, the energy appears to be
continuous because it is being released in very large quantities of quanta.
The movement of electrons in microelectronics is of particular interest because of the
significant reductions in size that continue to be achieved in the fabrication of integrated
circuits. The feature sizes of the devices in integrated circuits produced in 2009 are on the
order of 50 nm. They are projected to decrease in size to about 20 nm by around 2015. At a
feature size of around 10 nm, the effects of quantum mechanics become significant, changing
the way a device operates. As feature size continues to be reduced toward just a few
nanometers, the proportion of surface atoms in the device increases relative to those beneath
the surface, which means that the electrical characteristics are no longer determined exclusivelyby thebulkpropertiesofthematerial.Asdevicesizecontinuestodecreaseanddensityof
components on a chip continues to increase, the electronics industry is approaching the limits
of technological feasibility of the current fabrication processes discussed in Chapter 34.

37.2.2 SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPES
Conventional optical microscopes use visible light focused through optical lenses to provide
enlarged images of very small objects. However, the wavelength of visible light is 400 to 700 nm,
which is greater than the dimensions of nanosized objects. Thus, these objects cannot be seen
with conventional optical microscopes. The most powerful optical microscopes provide
magnifications of about 1000 times, allowing resolutions of about 0.0002 mm (200 nm).
Electronmicroscopes,whichallowspecimensto bevisualizedusingabeamofelectronsinstead
of light, were developed in the 1930s. The electron beam can be considered as a form of wave
motion, but one that has a much shorter effective wavelength. (Today’s electron microscopes
permit magnifications of about 1,000,000 times and resolutions of about 1 nm). To obtain an
image of a surface, the electron beam is scanned across the surface of an object in a raster
pattern, similar to the way a cathode ray scans the surface of a television screen.
For making observations on the nanoscale level, an improvement over the electron
microscope is the family of scanning probe instruments that date from the 1980s. They
possess magnification capabilities approximately 10 times greater than an electron microscope. In a scanning probe microscope (SPM), the probe consists of a needle with a very
sharp tip. The point size approaches the size of a single atom. In operation, the probe is
moved along the surface of the specimen at a distance of only one nanometer or so, and any
of several properties of the surface are measured, depending on the type of scanning probe
device. The two scanning probe microscopes of greatest interest in nanotechnology are the
scanning tunneling microscope and the atomic force microscope.
The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was the first scanning probe instrument
to be developed. It is called a tunneling microscope because its operation is based on the
quantum mechanics phenomenon known as tunneling, in which individual electrons in a
solid material can jump beyond the surface of the solid into space. The probability of
electrons being in this space beyond the surface decreases exponentially in proportion to
the distance from the surface. This sensitivity to distance is exploited in the STM by
positioning the probe tip very close to the surface (i.e., 1 nm) and applying a small voltage
between the two. This causes electrons of surface atoms to be attracted to the small positive
charge of the tip, and they tunnel across the gap to the probe. As the probe is moved along
the surface, variations in the resulting current occur because of the positions of individual

atoms on the surface. Alternatively, if the elevation of the tip above the surface is allowed to
float by maintaining a constant current, then the vertical deflection of the tip can be
measured as it traverses the surface. These variations in current or deflection can be used to
create images or topographical maps of the surface on an atomic or molecular scale.
A limitation of the scanning tunneling microscope is that it can only be used on surfaces
of conducting materials. By comparison, the atomic force microscope (AFM) can be used on
any material; it uses a probe attached to a delicate cantilever that deflects because of the force
exerted by the surface on the probe as it traverses the specimen surface. The AFM responds to
various types of forces, depending on the application. The forces include mechanical owing
to physical contact of the probe with the specimen surface, and non-contact, such as van der
Waals forces (Section 2.2), capillary forces, magnetic forces,3 and others. The vertical
deflection of the probe is measured optically, based on the interference pattern of a light
beam or the reflection of a laser beam from the cantilever. Figure 37.3 shows an image
generated by an AFM.
Our discussion here has focused on the use of scanning probe microscopes for observing
surfaces. In Section 37.3.2, we describe applications of these instruments for manipulating
individual atoms, molecules, and other nanoscale clusters of atoms or molecules.

37.3

NANOFABRICATION PROCESSES
Creating products at least some of whose feature sizes are in the nanometer range requires
fabrication techniques that are often quite different from those used to process bulk
materials and macro-sized products. The fabrication processes for nanometer-scale materials and structures can be divided into two basic categories:
1. Top-down approaches, which adapt some of the lithography-based microfabrication
techniques discussed in Chapters 34 and 36 to nanoscale object sizes. They involve
mostly subtractive processes (material removal) to achieve the desired geometry.

The term magnetic force microscope (MFM) is used when the forces are magnetic. The principle of
operation is similar to that of the reading head on a hard disk drive.

Chapter 37/Nanofabrication Technologies

2. Bottom-up approaches, in which atoms and molecules are manipulated and combined
into larger structures. These might be described as additive processes because they
construct the nanoscale entity from smaller components.
Our organization in this section is based on these two approaches. Because the processing
methods associated with the top-down approaches have been discussed in two previous
chapters, our coverage in Section 37.3.1 will emphasize how these processes must be
modified for the nanoscale. Section 37.3.2 discusses the bottom-up approaches, which are
perhaps of greater interest here because of their uniqueness and special relevance to
nanotechnology.

37.3.1 TOP-DOWN PROCESSING APPROACHES
The top-down approaches for fabricating nanoscale objects involve the processing of bulk
materials (e.g., silicon wafers) and thin films using lithographic techniques like those used in
the fabrication of integrated circuits and microsystems. The top-down approaches also
include other precision machining techniques (Section 36.2.3) that have been adapted for
making nanostructures. The term nanomachining is used for these processes that involve
material removal when applied in the sub-micron scale. Nanostructures have been machined
out of materials such as silicon, silicon carbide, diamond, and silicon nitride [23]. Nanomachining must often be coupled with thin-film deposition processes such as physical vapor
deposition and chemical vapor deposition (Section 28.5) to achieve the desired structure and
combination of materials.
As the feature sizes of the components in an integrated circuit (IC) become smaller
and smaller, fabrication techniques based on optical lithography become limited because
of the wavelengths of visible light. Ultraviolet light is currently used to fabricate ICs
because its shorter wavelengths permit smaller features to be fabricated, thus allowing
higher densities of components in the IC. The current technology being refined for IC
fabrication is called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography (Section 34.3.2). It uses UV
light with a wavelength as short as 13 nm, which is certainly within the nanotechnology
range. However, certain technical problems must be addressed when EUV lithography is
used at these very short UV wavelengths. The problems include (1) new photoresists that
are sensitive to this wavelength must be used, (2) focusing systems must be based on all
reflective optics, and (3) plasma sources based on laser irradiation of the element xenon
[14] must be used.
Other lithography techniques are available for use in fabricating nanoscale structures. These include electron-beam lithography, x-ray lithography, and micro- or nanoimprint lithography. Electron-beam and x-ray lithography are discussed in the context of
integrated circuit processing in Section 34.3.2. Electron-beam lithography (EBL) operates
by directing a highly focused beam of electrons along the desired pattern across the surface
of a material, thus exposing the surface areas using a sequential process without the need
for a mask. Although EBL is capable of resolutions on the order of 10 nm, its sequential
operation makes it relatively slow compared with masking techniques and thus it is
unsuited to mass production. X-ray lithography can produce patterns with resolutions
around 20 nm, and it uses masking techniques, which makes high production possible.
However, x-rays are difficult to focus and require contact or proximity printing (Section
34.3.1). In addition, the equipment is expensive for production applications, and x-rays are
hazardous to humans.
Two of the processes known as soft lithography are described in our previous chapter
on microfabrication (Section 36.2.3). The processes are micro-imprint lithography, in
which a patterned flat mold (similar to a rubber stamp) is used to mechanically deform a

thermoplastic resist on the surface of a substrate in preparation for etching, and microcontact printing, in which the stamp is dipped into a substance and then pressed against a
substrate. This transfers a very thin layer of the substance onto the substrate surface in the
pattern defined by the stamp. These same processes can be applied to nanofabrication, in
which case they are called nano-imprint lithography and nano-contact printing. Nanoimprint lithography can produce pattern resolutions of approximately 5 nm [23]. One of the
original applications of nano-contact printing was to transfer a thin film of thiols (a family of
organic compounds derived from hydrogen sulfide) onto a gold surface. The uniqueness of
the application was that the film was only one molecule thick (called a monolayer, Section
37.3.2), which certainly qualifies as nanoscale.

37.3.2 BOTTOM-UP PROCESSING APPROACHES
In the bottom-up approaches, the starting materials are atoms, molecules, and ions. The
processes bring these basic building blocks together, in some cases one at a time, to fabricate
the desired nanoscale entity. Our coverage consists of three approaches that are of
considerable interest in nanotechnology: (1) production of carbon nanotubes, (2) nanofabrication by scanning probe techniques, and (3) self-assembly.
Production of Carbon Nanotubes The remarkable properties and potential applications of carbon nanotubes are discussed in Section 37.1.1. Carbon nanotubes can be
produced by several techniques. In the following paragraphs we discuss three: (1) laser
evaporation, (2) carbon arc techniques, and (3) chemical vapor deposition.
In the laser evaporation method, the starting raw material is a graphite workpiece
containing small amounts of cobalt and nickel. These metal traces perform the role of
catalyst, acting as nucleation sites for the subsequent formation of the nanotubes. The
graphite is placed in a quartz tube filled with argon gas and heated to 1200 C (2200 F). A
pulsed laser beam is focused on the workpiece, causing the carbon atoms to evaporate from
the bulk graphite. The argon moves the carbon atoms out of the high-temperature region of
the tube and into an area in which a water-cooled copper apparatus is located. The carbon
atoms condense on the cold copper, and as they do, they form nanotubes with diameters of
10 to 20 nm and lengths of about 100 mm.
The carbon arc technique uses two carbon electrodes that are 5 to 20 mm in diameter
and separated by 1 mm. The electrodes are located in a partially evacuated container (about
2/3 of 1 atmospheric pressure) with helium flowing in it. To start the process, a voltage of
about 25 V is applied across the two electrodes, causing carbon atoms to be ejected from the
positive electrode and carried to the negative electrode where they form nanotubes. The
structure of the nanotubes depends on whether a catalyst is used. If no catalyst is used, then
multi-walled nanotubes are produced. If trace amounts of cobalt, iron, or nickel are placed
in the interior of the positive electrode, then the process creates single-walled nanotubes
that are 1 to 5 nm in diameter and about 1 mm long.
Chemical vapor deposition (Section 28.5.2) can be used to produce carbon nanotubes. In one variation of CVD, the starting work material is a hydrocarbon gas such as
methane (CH4). The gas is heated to 1100 C (2000 F), causing it to decompose and release
carbon atoms. The atoms then condense on a cool substrate to form nanotubes with open
ends rather than the closed ends characteristic of the other fabrication techniques. The
substrate may contain iron or other metals that act as catalysts for the process. The metal
catalyst acts as a nucleation site for creation of the nanotube, and it also controls the
orientation of the structure. An alternative CVD process called HiPCO (high-pressure
carbon monoxide decomposition process) starts with carbon monoxide (CO) and uses
carbon pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) as the catalyst to produce high-purity single-walled
nanotubes at 900 C to 1100 C (1700 to 2000 F) and 30 to 50 atm [7].

Chapter 37/Nanofabrication Technologies

Production of nanotubes by CVD has the advantage that it can be operated
continuously, which makes it economically attractive for mass production.
Nanofabrication by Scanning Probe Techniques Scanning probe microscopy (SPM)
techniques are described in Section 37.2.2 in the context of measuring and observing
nanometer-scale features and objects. In addition to viewing a surface, the scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) can also be used to
manipulate individual atoms, molecules, or clusters of atoms or molecules that adhere to
a substrate surface by the forces of adsorption (weak chemical bonds). Clusters of atoms
or molecules are called nanoclusters, and their size is just a few nanometers [23]. Figure
37.4(a) illustrates the variation in either current or deflection of the STM probe tip as it is
moved across a surface upon which is located an adsorbed atom. As the tip moves over
the surface immediately above the adsorbed atom, there is an increase in the signal.
Although the bonding force that attracts the atom to the surface is weak, it is significantly
greater than the force of attraction created by the tip, simply because the distance is
greater. However, if the probe tip is moved close enough to the adsorbed atom so that its
force of attraction is greater than the adsorption force, the atom will be dragged along the
surface, as suggested in Figure 37.4(b). In this way, individual atoms or molecules can be
manipulated to create various nanoscale structures. A notable STM example accomplished at the IBM Research Labs was the fabrication of the company logo out of xenon
atoms adsorbed onto a nickel surface in an area 5  16 nm. This scale is considerably
smaller than the lettering in Figure 37.3 (which is also nanoscale, as noted in the caption).
The manipulation of individual atoms or molecules by scanning tunneling microscopy
techniques can be classified as lateral manipulation and vertical manipulation. In lateral
manipulation, atoms or molecules are transferred horizontally along the surface by the
attractive or repulsive forces exerted by the STM tip, as in Figure 37.5(b). In vertical
manipulation, the atoms or molecules are lifted from the surface and deposited at a different
location to form a structure. Although this kind of STM manipulation of atoms and molecules
is of scientific interest, there are technological limitations that inhibit its commercial

application, at least in high production of nanotech products. One of the limitations is that it
must be carried out in a very high vacuum environment to prevent stray atoms or molecules
from interfering with the process. Another limitation is that the surface of the substrate must
be cooled to temperatures approaching absolute zero (273 C or 460 F) to reduce thermal
diffusion that would gradually distort the atomic structure being formed. These limitations
make it a very slow and expensive process.
The atomic force microscope is also used for similar nanoscale manipulations. In
comparing the AFM and STM applications, the AFM is more versatile because it is not
restricted to conductive surfaces as is the STM and it can be used under normal room
conditions. On the other hand, the AFM has a lower resolution than the STM. Consequently, the STM can be used to manipulate single atoms, whereas the AFM is better suited
to the manipulation of larger molecules and nanoclusters [23].
Another scanning probe technique, one that shows promise for practical applications, is
called dip-pen nanolithography. In dip-pen nanolithography (DPN), the tip of an atomic force
microscope is used to transfer molecules to a substrate surface by means of a solvent meniscus,
as shown in Figure 37.5. The process is somewhat analogous to using an old-fashioned quill pen
to transfer ink to a paper surface via capillary forces. In DPN, the AFM tip serves as the nib of
the pen, and the substrate becomes the surface onto which the dissolved molecules (i.e., the
ink) are deposited. The deposited molecules must have a chemical affinity for the substrate
material, just as wet ink adheres to paper. DPN can be used to ‘‘write’’ patterns of molecules
onto asurface,wherethepatternsareofsubmicron dimension.Inaddition,DPNcan beusedto
deposit different types of molecules at different locations on the substrate surface.
Self-Assembly Self-assembly is a fundamental process in nature. The natural formation of
a crystalline structure during the slow cooling of molten minerals is an example of nonliving
self-assembly. The growth of living organisms is an example of biological self-assembly. In both
instances, entities at the atomic and molecular level combine on their own into larger entities,
proceeding in a constructive manner toward the creation of some deliberate thing. If the thing
is a living organism, the intermediate entities are biological cells, and the organism is grown
through an additive process that exhibits massive replication of individual cell formations, yet
the final result is often remarkably intricate and complex (e.g., a human being).
One of the promising bottom-up approaches in nanotechnology involves the emulation
of nature’s self-assembly process to produce materials and systems that have nanometer-scale
features or building blocks, but the final product may be larger than nanoscale. It may be of
micro- or macro-scale size, at least in some of its dimensions. The term biomimetics describes
this process of building artificial, non-biological entities by imitating nature’s methods.
Desirableattributes of atomic or molecular self-assemblyprocesses in nanotechnologyinclude
the following: (1) they can be carried out rapidly; (2) they occur automatically and do not
require any central control; (3) they exhibit massive replication; and (4) they can be
performed under mild environmental conditions (at or near atmospheric pressure and

room temperature). Self-assembly is likely to be the most important of the nanofabrication
processes because of its low cost, capacity for producing structures over a range of sizes
(from nanoscale to macroscale), and general applicability to a wide variety of products [18].
An underlying principle behind self-assembly is that of minimum energy. Physical
entities such as atoms and molecules seek out a state that minimizes the total energy of the
system of which they are components. This principle has the following implications for selfassembly:
1. There must be some mechanism for the movement of the entities (e.g., atoms, molecules,
ions) in the system, thus causing the entities to come into close proximity with one another.
Possible mechanisms for this movement include diffusion, convection in a fluid, and electric
fields.
2. There must be some form of molecular recognition among the entities. Molecular
recognition refers to the tendency of one molecule (or atom or ion) to be attracted to and
bind with another molecule (or atom or ion), for example, the way sodium and chlorine
are attracted to each other to form table salt.
3. The molecular recognition among the entities causes them to join in such a way that the
resulting physical arrangement of the entities achieves a state of minimum energy. The
joining process involves chemical bonding, usually the weaker secondary types (e.g., van
der Waals bonds).
We have previously encountered several instances of molecular-level self-assembly
in this book. Let us cite two examples here: (1) crystal formation and (2) polymerization.
Crystal formation in metals, ceramics, and certain polymers is a form of self-assembly.
Growing silicon boules in the Czochralski process (Section 34.2.2) for fabrication of
integrated circuits is a good illustration. Using a starting seed crystal, very pure molten
silicon is formed into a large cylindrical solid whose repeating lattice structure matches
that of the seed throughout its volume. The lattice spacing in the crystal structure is of
nanometer proportions, but the replication exhibits long-range order.
It can be argued that polymers are products of nanometer-scale self-assembly. The
process of polymerization (Section 8.1.1) involves the joining of individual monomers
(individual molecules such as ethylene C2H4) to form very large molecules (macromolecules
such as polyethylene), often in the form of a long chain with thousands of repeating units.
Copolymers (Section 8.1.2) represent a more complex self-assembly process, in which two
different types of starting monomers are joined in a regular repeating structure. An example is
the copolymer synthesized from ethylene and propylene (C3H6). In these polymer examples,
the repeating units are of nanometer size, and they form by a massive self-assembly process
into bulk materials that have significant commercial value.
The technologies for producing silicon boules and polymers precede the current
scientific interest in nanotechnology. Of greater relevance in this chapter are self-assembly
fabrication techniques that have been developed under the nanotechnology banner. These
self-assembly processes, most of which are still in the research stage, include the following
categories: (1) fabrication of nanoscale objects, including molecules, macromolecules,
clusters of molecules, nanotubes, and crystals; and (2) formation of two-dimensional
arrays such as self-assembled monolayers (surface films that are one molecule thick) and
three-dimensional networks of molecules.
We have already discussed some of the processes in category 1. Let us consider the
self-assembly of surface films as an important example of category 2. Surface films are
two-dimensional coatings formed on a solid (three-dimensional) substrate. Most surface
films are inherently thin, yet the thickness is typically measured in micrometers or even
millimeters (or fractions thereof), well above the nanometer scale. Of interest here are
surface films whose thicknesses are measured in nanometers. Of particular interest in
nanotechnology are surface films that self-assemble, are only one molecule thick, and in
which the molecules are organized in some orderly fashion. These types of films are

called self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Multilayered structures are also possible that
possess order and are two or more molecules thick.
The substrate materials for self-assembled monolayers and multilayers include a
variety of metallic and other inorganic materials. The list includes gold, silver, copper,
silicon, and silicon dioxide. Noble metals have the advantage of not forming an oxide
surface film that would interfere with the reactions that generate the desired layer of
interest. Layering materials include thiols, sulfides, and disulfides. The layering material
must be capable of being adsorbed onto the surface material. The typical process
sequence in the formation of the monolayer of a thiol on gold is illustrated in Figure
37.6. (We mentioned this combination of thiol on a gold surface in Section 37.3.1 in the
context of nano-contact printing.) Layering molecules move freely above the substrate
surface and are adsorbed onto the surface. Contact occurs between adsorbed molecules
on the surface, and they form stable islands. The islands become larger and gradually join
together through the addition of more molecules laterally on the surface, until the
substrate is completely covered. Bonding to the gold surface is provided by the sulfur
atom in the thiol, sulfide, or disulfide layer. In some applications, self-assembled
monolayers can be formed into desired patterns or regions on the substrate surface
using techniques such as nano-contact printing and dip-pen nanolithography.

In this part of the book, we consider the manufacturing
systems that are commonly associated with the production
and assembly processes discussed in preceding chapters. A
manufacturing system can be defined as a collection of integrated equipment and human resources that performs one or
more processing and/or assembly operations on a starting
work material, part, or set of parts. The integrated equipment
consists of production machines, material handling and positioning devices, and computer systems. Human resources are
required either full-time or part-time to keep the equipment
operating. The position of the manufacturing systems in the
larger production system is shown in Figure 38.1. As the
diagram indicates, the manufacturing systems are located in
the factory. They accomplish the value-added work on the part
or product.
Manufacturing systems include both automated and
manually operated systems. The distinction between the two
categories is not always clear, because many manufacturing
systems consist of both automated and manual work elements (e.g., a machine tool that operates on a semiautomatic
processing cycle but which must be loaded and unloaded
each cycle by a human worker). Our coverage includes both
categories and is organized into two chapters: Chapter 38 on
automation technologies and Chapter 39 on integrated
manufacturing systems. Chapter 38 provides an introductory

treatment of automation technology and the components that make up an automated
system. We also discuss two important automation technologies used in manufacturing:
numerical control and industrial robotics. In Chapter 39, we examine how these automation
technologies are integrated into more sophisticated manufacturing systems. Topics include
production lines, cellular manufacturing, flexible manufacturing systems, and computer
integrated manufacturing. A more detailed discussion of the topics in these two chapters
can be found in [5].

38.1

AUTOMATION FUNDAMENTALS
Automation can be defined as the technology by which a process or procedure is
performed without human assistance. Humans may be present as observers or even
participants, but the process itself operates under its own self-direction. Automation
is implemented by means of a control system that executes a program of instructions.
To automate a process, power is required to operate the control system and to drive
the process itself.

38.1.1 THREE COMPONENTS OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM
As indicated above, an automated system consists of three basic components: (1) power,
(2) a program of instructions, and (3) a control system to carry out the instructions. The
relationship among these components is shown in Figure 38.2.
The form of power used in most automated systems is electrical. The advantages of
electrical power include (1) it is widely available, (2) it can be readily converted to other
forms of power such as mechanical, thermal, or hydraulic, (3) it can be used at very low
power levels for functions such as signal processing, communication, data storage, and
data processing, and (4) it can be stored in long-life batteries [5].

Chapter 38/Automation Technologies for Manufacturing Systems

In a manufacturing process, power is required to accomplish the activities associated
with the particular process. Examples of these activities include (1) melting a metal in a
casting operation, (2) driving the motions of a cutting tool relative to a workpiece in a
machining operation, and (3) pressing and sintering parts in a powder metallurgy process.
Power is also used to accomplish any material handling activities needed in the process,
such as loading and unloading parts, if these activities are not performed manually. Finally,
power is used to operate the control system.
The activities in an automated process are determined by a program of instructions. In
the simplest automated processes, the only instruction may be to maintain a certain
controlled variable at a specified level, such as regulating the temperature in a heat treatment
furnace. In more complex processes, a sequence of activities is required during the work
cycle, and the order and details of each activity are defined by the program of instructions.
Each activity involves changes in one or more process parameters, such as changing the xcoordinate position of a machine tool worktable, opening or closing a valve in a fluid flow
system, or turning a motor on or off. Process parameters are inputs to the process. They may
be continuous (continuously variable over a given range, such as the x-position of a
worktable) or discrete (On or Off). Their values affect the outputs of the process, which
are called process variables. Like process parameters, process variables can be continuous
or discrete. Examples include the actual position of the machine worktable, the rotational
speed of a motor shaft, or whether a warning light is on or off. The program of instructions
specifies the changes in process parameters and when they should occur during the work
cycle, and these changes determine the resulting values of the process variables. For example,
in computer numerical control, the program of instructions is called a part program. The
numerical control (NC) part program specifies the individual sequence of steps required to
machine a given part, including worktable and cutter positions, cutting speeds, feeds, and
other details of the operation.
In some automated processes, the work cycle program must contain instructions for
making decisions or reacting to unexpected events during the work cycle. Examples of
situations requiring this kind of capability include (1) variations in raw materials that
require adjusting certain process parameters to compensate, (2) interactions and communications with human such as responding to requests for system status information,
(3) safety monitoring requirements, and (4) equipment malfunctions.
The program of instructions is executed by a control system, the third basic
component of an automated system. Two types of control system can be distinguished:
closed loop and open loop. A closed loop system, also known as a feedback control system,
is one in which the process variable of interest (output of the process) is compared with the
corresponding process parameter (input to the process), and any difference between them
is used to drive the output value into agreement with the input. Figure 38.3(a) shows the six
elements of a closed loop system: (1) input parameter, (2) process, (3) output variable, (4)
feedback sensor, (5) controller, and (6) actuator. The input parameter represents the
desired value of the output variable. The process is the operation or activity being
controlled; more specifically, the output variable is being controlled by the system. A
sensor is used to measure the output variable and feed back its value to the controller,
which compares output with input and makes the required adjustment to reduce any
difference. The adjustment is made by means of one or more actuators, which are
hardware devices that physically accomplish the control actions.
The other type of control system is an open loop system, presented in Figure 38.3(b).
As shown in the diagram, an open loop system executes the program of instructions
without a feedback loop. No measurement of the output variable is made, so there is no
comparison between output and input in an open loop system. In effect, the controller
relies on the expectation that the actuator will have the intended effect on the output
variable. Thus, there is always a risk in an open loop system that the actuator will not
function properly or that its actuation will not have the expected effect on the output. On

the other hand, the advantage of an open loop system is that its cost is less than a
comparable closed loop system.

38.1.2 TYPES OF AUTOMATION
Automated systems used in manufacturing can be classified into three basic types:
(1) fixed automation, (2) programmable automation, and (3) flexible automation.
Fixed Automation In fixed automation, the processing or assembly steps and their
sequence are fixed by the equipment configuration. The program of instructions is determined by the equipment design and cannot be easily changed. Each step in the sequence
usually involves a simple action, such as feeding a rotating spindle along a linear trajectory.
Although the work cycle consists of simple operations, integrating and coordinating the
actions can result in the need for a rather sophisticated control system, and computer control
is often required.
Typical features of fixed automation include (1) high initial investment for specialized
equipment, (2) high production rates, and (3) little or no flexibility to accommodate product
variety. Automated systems with these features can be justified for parts and products that
are produced in very large quantities. The high investment cost can be spread over many
units, thus making the cost per unit relatively low compared to alternative production
methods. The automated production lines discussed in the following chapter are examples
of fixed automation.
Programmable Automation As its name suggests, the equipment in programmable
automation is designed with the capability to change the program of instructions to allow
production of different parts or products. New programs can be prepared for new parts, and
the equipment can read each program and execute the encoded instructions. Thus the
features that characterize programmable automation are (1) high investment in general
purpose equipment that can be reprogrammed, (2) lower production rates than fixed
automation, (3) ability to cope with product variety by reprogramming the equipment, and
(4) suitability for batch production of various part or product styles. Examples of programmable automation include computer numerical control and industrial robotics, discussed in
Sections 38.3 and 38.4, respectively.
Flexible Automation Suitability for batch production is mentioned as one of the
features of programmable automation. As discussed in Chapter 1, the disadvantage

E1C38

11/09/2009

890

18:1:2

Page 890

Chapter 38/Automation Technologies for Manufacturing Systems

of batch production is that lost production time occurs between batches due to
equipment and/or tooling changeovers that are required to accommodate the next
batch. Thus, programmable automation usually suffers from this disadvantage.
Flexible automation is an extension of programmable automation in which there
is virtually no lost production time for setup changes and/or reprogramming. Any
required changes in the program of instructions and/or setup can be accomplished
quickly; that is, within the time needed to move the next work unit into position at the
machine. A flexible system is therefore capable of producing a mixture of different
parts or products one right after the other instead of in batches. Features usually
associated with flexible automation include (1) high investment cost for customengineered equipment, (2) medium production rates, and (3) continuous production
of different part or product styles.
Using some terminology developed in Chapter 1, we might say that fixed automation is applicable in situations of hard product variety, programmable automation is
applicable to medium product variety, and flexible automation can be used for soft
product variety.

38.2 HARDWARE COMPONENTS FOR AUTOMATION
Automation and process control are implemented using various hardware devices that
interact with the production operation and associated processing equipment. Sensors are
required to measure the process variables. Actuators are used to drive the process
parameters. And various additional devices are needed to interface the sensors and
actuators with the process controller, which is usually a digital computer.

38.2.1 SENSORS
A sensor is a device that converts a physical stimulus or variable of interest (e.g.,
temperature, force, pressure, or other characteristic of the process) into a more convenient
physical form (e.g., electrical voltage) for the purpose of measuring the variable. The
conversion allows the variable to be interpreted as a quantitative value.
Sensors of various types are available to collect data for feedback control in
manufacturing automation. They are often classified according to type of stimulus;
thus, we have mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiation, magnetic, and chemical variables.
Within each category, there are multiple variables that can be measured. Within the
mechanical category, the physical variables include position, velocity, force, torque, and
many others. Electrical variables include voltage, current, and resistance. And so on for
the other major categories.
In addition to type of stimulus, sensors are also classified as analog or discrete. An
analog sensor measures a continuous analog variable and converts it into a continuous
signal such as electrical voltage. Thermocouples, strain gages, and ammeters are examples of analog sensors. A discrete sensor produces a signal that can have only a limited
number of values. Within this category, we have binary sensors and digital sensors. A
binary sensor can take on only two possible values, such as Off and On, or 0 and 1. Limit
switches operate this way. A digital sensor produces a digital output signal, either in the
form of parallel status bits, such as a photoelectric sensor array) or a series of pulses that
can be counted, such as an optical encoder. Digital sensors have an advantage that they can
be readily interfaced to a digital computer, whereas the signals from analog sensors must
be converted to digital in order to be read by the computer.

Section 38.2/Hardware Components for Automation

891

For a given sensor, there is a relationship between the value of the physical stimulus
and the value of the signal produced by the sensor. This input/output relationship is called
the sensor’s transfer function, which can be expressed as:
S ¼ f ðsÞ

ð38:1Þ

where S ¼ the output signal of the sensor (typically voltage), s ¼ the stimulus or input,
and f(s) is the functional relationship between them. The ideal form for an analog sensor
is a proportional relationship:
S ¼ C þ ms

ð38:2Þ

where C ¼ the value of the sensor output when the stimulus value is zero, and m ¼ the
constant of proportionality between s and S. The constant m indicates how much the
output S is affected by the input s. This is referred to as the sensitivity of the measuring
device. For example, a standard Chromel/Alumel thermocouple produces 40.6 microvolts per  C change in temperature.
A binary sensor (e.g., limit switch, photoelectric switch) exhibits a binary relationship between stimulus and sensor output:
S ¼ 1 if s > 0 and S ¼ 0 if s  0

ð38:3Þ

Before a measuring device can be used, it must be calibrated, which basically means
determining the transfer function of the sensor; specifically, how is the value of the
stimulus s determined from the value of the output signal S? Ease of calibration is one
criterion by which a measuring device can be selected. Other criteria include accuracy,
precision, operating range, speed of response, reliability and cost.

38.2.2 ACTUATORS
In automated systems, an actuator is a device that converts a control signal into a physical
action, which usually refers to a change in a process input parameter. The action is
typically mechanical, such as a change in position of a worktable or rotational speed of a
motor. The control signal is generally a low level signal, and an amplifier may be required
to increase the power of the signal to drive the actuator.
Actuators can be classified according to type of amplifier as (1) electrical, (2) hydraulic, or (3) pneumatic. Electrical actuators include AC and DC electric motors, stepper
motors, and solenoids. The operations of two types of electric motors (servomotors and
stepper motors) are described in Section 38.3.2, which deals with the analysis of positioning
systems. Hydraulic actuators utilize hydraulic fluid to amplify the control signal and are
often specified when large forces are required in the application. Pneumatic actuators are
driven by compressed air, which is commonly used in factories. All three actuator types are
available as linear or rotational devices. This designation distinguishes whether the output
action is a linear motion or a rotational motion. Electric motors and stepper motors are
more common as rotational actuators, whereas most hydraulic and pneumatic actuators
provide a linear output.

38.2.3 INTERFACE DEVICES
Interface devices allow the process to be connected to the computer controller and vice
versa. Sensor signals from the manufacturing process are fed into the computer, and

command signals are sent to actuators that operate the process. In this section, we discuss
the hardware devices that enable this communication between the process and the
controller. The devices include analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters,
contact input/output interfaces, and pulse counters and generators.
Continuous analog signals from sensors attached to the process must be transformed into digital values that can be used by the control computer, a function that is
accomplished by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). As illustrated in Figure 38.4,
an ADC (1) samples the continuous signal at periodic intervals, (2) converts the
sampled data into one of a finite number of defined amplitude levels, and (3) encodes
each amplitude level into a sequence of binary digits that can be interpreted by the
control computer. Important characteristics of an analog-to-digital converter include
sampling rate and resolution. Sampling rate is the frequency with which the continuous
signal is sampled. A faster sampling rate means that the actual form of the continuous
signal can be more closely approximated. Resolution refers to the precision with which
the analog value can be converted into binary code. This depends on the number of bits
used in the encoding procedure, the more bits, the higher the resolution. Unfortunately, using more bits requires more time to make the conversion, which can
impose a practical limit on the sampling rate.
A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) accomplishes the reverse process of the
ADC. It converts the digital output of the control computer into a quasi-continuous
signal capable of driving an analog actuator or other analog device. The DAC performs its
function in two steps: (1) decoding, in which the sequence of digital output values is
transformed into a corresponding series of analog values at discrete time intervals, and
(2) data holding, in which each analog value is changed into a continuous signal during
the duration of the time interval. In the simplest case, the continuous signal consists of a
series of step functions, as in Figure 38.5, which are used to drive the analog actuator.

Many automated systems operate by turning on and off motors, switches, and other
devices to respond to conditions and as a function of time. These control devices use
binary variables. They can have either of two possible values, 1 or 0, interpreted as On or
Off, object present or not present, high or low voltage level, and so on. Binary sensors
commonly used in process control systems include limit switches and photocells.
Common binary actuators solenoids, valves, clutches, lights, control relays, and certain
motors.
Contact input/output interfaces are components used to communicate binary data
back and forth between the process and the control computer. A contact input interface
is a device that reads binary data into the computer from an external source. It consists of
a series of binary electrical contacts that indicate the status of a binary device such as a
limit switch attached to the process. The status of each contact is periodically scanned by
the computer to update values used by the control program. A contact output interface is
a device used to communicate on/off signals from the computer to external binary
components such as solenoids, alarms, and indicator lights. It can also be used to turn on
and off constant speed motors.
As mentioned earlier, discrete data sometimes exist in the form of a series of pulses.
For example, an optical encoder (discussed in Section 38.3.2) emits its measurement of
position and velocity as a series of pulses. A pulse counter is a device that converts a series
of pulses from an external source into a digital value, which is entered into the control
computer. In addition to reading the output of an optical encoder, applications of pulse
counters include counting the number of parts flowing along a conveyor past a photoelectric sensor. The opposite of a pulse counter is a pulse generator, a device that
produces a series of electrical pulses based on digital values generated by a control
computer. Both the number and frequency of the pulses are controlled. An important
pulse generator application is to drive stepper motors, which respond to each step by
rotating through a small incremental angle, called a step angle.

38.2.4 PROCESS CONTROLLERS
Most process control systems use some type of digital computer as the controller.
Whether control involves continuous or discrete parameters and variables, or a
combination of continuous and discrete, a digital computer can be connected to
the process to communicate and interact with it using the interface devices discussed
in Section 38.2.3. Requirements generally associated with real-time computer control
include the following:
å The capability of the computer to respond to incoming signals from the process and if
necessary, to interrupt execution of a current program to service the incoming signal.
å The capability to transmit commands to the process that are implemented by means
of actuators connected to the process. These commands may be the response to
incoming signals from the process.
å The capability to execute certain actions at specific points in time during process
operation.
å The capability to communicate and interact with other computers that may be
connected to the process. The term distributed process control is used to describe a
control system in which multiple microcomputers are used to share the process
control workload.
å The capability to accept input from operating personnel for purposes such as entering
new programs or data, editing existing programs, and stopping the process in an
emergency.

Memory

A widely used process controller that satisfies these requirements is a programmable logic controller. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a microcomputerbased controller that uses stored instructions in programmable memory to implement
logic, sequencing, timing, counting, and arithmetic control functions, through digital or
analog input/output modules, for controlling various machines and processes. The major
components of a PLC, shown in Figure 38.6, are (1) input and output modules, which
connect the PLC to the industrial equipment to be controlled; (2) processor—the central
processing unit (CPU), which executes the logic and sequencing functions to control the
process by operating on the input signals and determining the proper output signals
specified by the control program; (3) PLC memory, which is connected to the processor
and contains the logic and sequencing instructions; (4) power supply—115 V AC is
typically used to drive the PLC. In addition, (5) a programming device (usually
detachable) is used to enter the program into the PLC.
Programming involves entry of the control instructions to the PLC using the
programming device. The most common control instructions include logical operations,
sequencing, counting, and timing. Many control applications require additional instructions for analog control, data processing, and computations. A variety of PLC programming languages have been developed, ranging from ladder logic diagrams to structured
text. A discussion of these languages is beyond the scope of this text, and the reader is
referred to our references.
Advantages associated with programmable logic controllers include (1) programming a PLC is easier than wiring a relay control panel; (2) PLCs can be reprogrammed,
whereas conventional hard-wired controls must be rewired and are often scrapped
instead because of the difficulty in rewiring; (3) a PLC can be interfaced with the plant
computer system more readily than conventional controls; (4) PLCs require less floor
space than relay controls, and (5) PLCs offer greater reliability and easier maintenance.

38.3 COMPUTER NUMERICAL CONTROL
Numerical control (NC) is a form of programmable automation in which the mechanical
actions of a piece of equipment are controlled by a program containing coded alphanumeric data. The data represent relative positions between a workhead and a workpart.
The workhead is a tool or other processing element, and the workpart is the object being
processed. The operating principle of NC is to control the motion of the workhead

E1C38

895

relative to the workpart and to control the sequence in which the motions are carried out.
The first application of numerical control was in machining (Historical Note 38.1), and
this is still an important application area. NC machine tools are shown in Figures 22.26
and 22.27. Our video clip on computer numerical control shows the various types of CNC
machines and operations.

Historical Note 38.1

Numerical control [3], [5]

he initial development work on numerical control is
credited to John Parsons and Frank Stulen at the Parsons
Corporation in Michigan in the late 1940s. Parsons was a
machining contractor for the U.S. Air Force and had
devised a means of using numerical coordinate data to
move the worktable of a milling machine for producing
complex parts for aircraft. On the basis of Parson’s work,
the Air Force awarded a contract to the company in 1949
to study the feasibility of the new control concept for
machine tools. The project was subcontracted to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a
prototype machine tool that utilized the new numerical
data principle. The M.I.T. study confirmed that the concept
was feasible and proceeded to adapt a three-axis vertical
milling machine using combined analog-digital controls.
The name numerical control (NC) was given to the system
by which the machine tool motions were accomplished.
The prototype machine was demonstrated in 1952.
The accuracy and repeatability of the NC system
was far better than the manual machining methods

then available. The potential for reducing
nonproductive time in the machining cycle was also
apparent. In 1956, the Air Force sponsored the
development of NC machine tools at several different
companies. These machines were placed in operation
at various aircraft plants between 1958 and 1960. The
advantages of NC soon became clear, and aerospace
companies began placing orders for new NC
machines.
The importance of part programming was clear from
the start. The Air Force continued to encourage the
development and application of NC by sponsoring
research at M.I.T. for a part programming language to
control NC machines. This research resulted in the
development of APT in 1958 (APT stands for
Automatically Programmed Tooling). APT is a part
programming language by which a user could write the
machining instructions in simple English-like statements,
and the statements were coded to be interpreted by the
NC system.

38.3.1 THE TECHNOLOGY OF NUMERICAL CONTROL
In this section we define the components of a numerical control system, and then proceed
to describe the coordinate axis system and motion controls.
Components of an NC System A numerical control system consists of three basic
components: (1) part program, (2) machine control unit, and (3) processing equipment.
The part program (the term commonly used in machine tool technology) is the detailed
set of commands to be followed by the processing equipment. It is the program of
instructions in the NC control system. Each command specifies a position or motion that
is to be accomplished by the work head relative to the workpart. A position is defined by
its x-y-z coordinates. In machine tool applications, additional details in the NC program

other commands related to the operation. The part program is prepared by a part
programmer, a person who is familiar with the details of the programming language and
also understands the technology of the processing equipment.
The machine control unit (MCU) in modern NC technology is a microcomputer
that stores and executes the program by converting each command into actions by the
processing equipment, one command at a time. The MCU consists of both hardware and
software. The hardware includes the microcomputer, components to interface with the
processing equipment, and certain feedback control elements. The software in the MCU
includes control system software, calculation algorithms, and translation software to
convert the NC part program into a usable format for the MCU. The MCU also permits
the part program to be edited in case the program contains errors, or changes in cutting
conditions are required. Because the MCU is a computer, the term computer numerical
control (CNC) is often used to distinguish this type of NC from its technological
predecessors that were based entirely on hard-wired electronics.
The processing equipment accomplishes the sequence of processing steps to
transform the starting workpart into a completed part. It operates under the control
of the MCU according to the instructions in the part program. We survey the variety of
applications and processing equipment in Section 38.3.4.
Coordinate System and Motion Control in NC A standard coordinate axis system is
used to specify positions in numerical control. The system consists of the three linear axes
(x, y, z) of the Cartesian coordinate system, plus three rotational axes (a, b, c), as shown in
Figure 38.7(a). The rotational axes are used to rotate the workpart to present different
surfaces for machining, or to orient the tool or workhead at some angle relative to the
part. Most NC systems do not require all six axes. The simplest NC systems (e.g., plotters,
pressworking machines for flat sheet-metal stock, and component insertion machines)
are positioning systems whose locations can be defined in an x-y plane. Programming of
these machines involves specifying a sequence of x-y coordinates. By contrast, some
machine tools have five-axis control to shape complex workpart geometries. These
systems typically include three linear axes plus two rotational axes.
The coordinates for a rotational NC system are illustrated in Figure 38.7(b). These
systems are associated with turning operations on NC lathes. Although the work rotates,
this is not one of the controlled axes in a conventional NC turning system. The cutting
path of the tool relative to the rotating workpiece is defined in the x-z plane, as shown in
our figure.

rotational work.

In many NC systems, the relative movements between the processing tool and the
workpart are accomplished by fixing the part to a worktable and then controlling the
positions and motions of the table relative to a stationary or semistationary workhead.
Most machine tools and component insertion machines are based on this method of
operation. In other systems, the workpart is held stationary and the work head is moved
along two or three axes. Flame cutters, x-y plotters, and coordinate measuring machines
operate in this mode.
Motion control systems based on NC can be divided into two types: (1) point-topoint and (2) continuous path. Point-to-point systems, also called positioning systems,
move the workhead (or workpiece) to a programmed location with no regard for the
path taken to get to that location. Once the move is completed, some processing
action is accomplished by the workhead at the location, such as drilling or punching a
hole. Thus, the program consists of a series of point locations at which operations are
performed.
Continuous path systems provide continuous simultaneous control of more than
one axis, thus controlling the path followed by the tool relative to the part. This permits
the tool to perform a process while the axes are moving, enabling the system to generate
angular surfaces, two-dimensional curves, or three-dimensional contours in the workpart.
This operating scheme is required in drafting machines, certain milling and turning
operations, and flame cutting. In machining, continuous path control also goes by the
name contouring.
An important aspect of continuous path motion is interpolation, which is
concerned with calculating the intermediate points along a path to be followed by
the workhead relative to the part. Two common forms of interpolation are linear and
circular. Linear interpolation is used for straight line paths, in which the part programmer specifies the coordinates of the beginning point and end point of the straight
line as well as the feed rate to be used. The interpolator then computes the travel speeds
of the two or three axes that will accomplish the specified trajectory. Circular
interpolation allows the workhead to follow a circular arc by specifying the coordinates
of its beginning and end points together with either the center or radius of the arc. The
interpolator computes a series of small straight line segments that will approximate the
arc within a defined tolerance.
Another aspect of motion control is concerned with whether the positions in the
coordinate system are defined absolutely or incrementally. In absolute positioning,
the workhead locations are always defined with respect to the origin of the axis system. In
incremental positioning, the next workhead position is defined relative to the present
location. The difference is illustrated in Figure 38.8.

FIGURE 38.8 Absolute
vs. incremental positioning. The workhead is at
point (2,3) and is to be
moved to point (6,8). In
absolute positioning, the
move is specified by x ¼ 6,
y ¼ 8; while in incremental
positioning, the move is
specified by x ¼ 4, y ¼ 5.

38.3.2 ANALYSIS OF NC POSITIONING SYSTEMS
The function of the positioning system is to convert the coordinates specified in the NC
part program into relative positions between the tool and workpart during processing.
Let us consider how a simple positioning system, shown in Figure 38.9, might operate.
The system consists of a worktable on which a workpart is fixtured. The purpose of the
table is to move the part relative to a tool or workhead. To accomplish this purpose, the
worktable is moved linearly by means of a rotating leadscrew that is driven by a motor.
For simplicity, only one axis is shown in our sketch. To provide x-y capability, the
system shown would be piggybacked on top of a second axis perpendicular to the first.
The leadscrew has a certain pitch p, mm/thread (in/thread) or mm/rev (in/rev). Thus,
the table is moved a distance equal to the leadscrew pitch for each revolution. The
velocity at which the worktable moves is determined by the rotational speed of the
leadscrew.
Two basic types of motion control are used in NC: (a) open loop and (b) closed
loop, as shown in Figure 38.10. The difference is that an open-loop system operates

without verifying that the desired position of the worktable has been achieved. A closedloop control system uses feedback measurement to verify that the position of the
worktable is indeed the location specified in the program. Open-loop systems are less
expensive than closed-loop systems and are appropriate when the force resisting the
actuating motion is minimal, as in point-to-point drilling, for example. Closed-loop
systems are normally specified for machine tools that perform continuous path operations such as milling or turning, in which the resisting forces can be significant.
Open-Loop Positioning Systems To turn the leadscrew, an open-loop positioning
system typically uses a stepping motor (a.k.a. stepper motor). In NC, the stepping motor
is driven by a series of electrical pulses generated by the machine control unit. Each pulse
causes the motor to rotate a fraction of one revolution, called the step angle. The
allowable step angles must conform to the relationship
a¼

360
ns

ð38:1Þ

where a ¼ step angle, degrees; and ns ¼ the number of step angles for the motor, which
must be an integer. The angle through which the motor shaft rotates is given by
Am ¼ anp

ð38:2Þ

where Am ¼ angle of motor shaft rotation, degrees; np ¼ number of pulses received by the
motor; and a ¼ step angle, here defined as degrees/pulse. Finally, the rotational speed of the
motor shaft is determined by the frequency of pulses sent to the motor:
Nm ¼

60af p
360

ð38:3Þ

where Nm ¼ speed of motor shaft rotation, rev/min; fp ¼ frequency of pulses driving
the stepper motor, Hz (pulses/sec), the constant 60 converts pulses/sec to pulses/min;
the constant 360 converts degrees of rotation to full revolutions; and a ¼ step angle
of the motor, as before.
The motor shaft drives the leadscrew that determines the position and velocity of the
worktable. The connection is often designed using a gear reduction to increase the precision
of table movement. However, the angle of rotation and rotational speed of the leadscrew
are reduced by this gear ratio. The relationships are as follows:
Am ¼ rg Als

ð38:4aÞ

N m ¼ rg N ls

ð38:4bÞ

and

where Am and Nm are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational speed, rev/min, of the
motor, respectively; Als and Nls are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational speed,
rev/min, of the leadscrew, respectively; and rg ¼ gear reduction between the motor shaft
and the leadscrew; for example, a gear reduction of 2 means that the motor shaft rotates
through two revolutions for each rotation of the leadscrew.
The linear position of the table in response to the rotation of the leadscrew depends
on the leadscrew pitch p, and can be determined as follows:
x¼

pAls
360

ð38:5Þ

where x ¼ x-axis position relative to the starting position, mm (in); p ¼ pitch of the
leadscrew, mm/rev (in/rev); and Als/360 ¼ the number of revolutions (and partial
revolutions) of the leadscrew. By combining Eqs. (38.2), (38.4a), and (38.5) and

a point-to-point system can be found:
np ¼

ð38:6Þ

The velocity of the worktable in the direction of the leadscrew axis can be determined as
follows:
vt ¼ f r ¼ N ls p
ð38:7Þ
where vt ¼ table travel speed, mm/min (in/min); fr ¼ table feed rate, mm/min (in/min);
Nls ¼ rotational speed of the leadscrew, rev/min; and p ¼ leadscrew pitch, mm/rev (in/
rev). The rotational speed of the leadscrew depends on the frequency of pulses driving
the stepping motor:
N ls ¼

ð38:8Þ

where Nls ¼ leadscrew rotational speed, rev/min; fp ¼ pulse train frequency, Hz (pulses/
sec); ns ¼ steps/rev, or pulses/rev, and rg ¼ gear reduction between the motor and the
leadscrew. For a two-axis table with continuous path control, the relative velocities of the
axes are coordinated to achieve the desired travel direction. Finally, the required pulse
frequency to drive the table at a specified feed rate can be obtained by combining Eqs.
(38.7) and (38.8) and rearranging to solve for fp:

A stepping motor has 48 step angles. Its output shaft is coupled to a leadscrew with a 4:1

leadscrew. The table must move a distance of 75.0 mm from its current position at a travel
speed of 400 mm/min. Determine (a) how many pulses are required to move the table the
specified distance and (b) the motor speed and (c) pulse frequency required to achieve

Closed-Loop Positioning Systems Closed-loop NC systems, Figure 38.10(b), use
servomotors and feedback measurements to ensure that the desired position is achieved.
A common feedback sensor used in NC (and also industrial robots) is the optical rotary
encoder, illustrated in Figure 38.11. It consists of a light source, a photocell, and a disk
containing a series of slots through which the light source can shine to energize the
photocell. The disk is connected to a rotating shaft, which in turn is connected directly to
the leadscrew. As the leadscrew rotates, the slots cause the light source to be seen by the
photocell as a series of flashes, which are converted into an equivalent series of electrical
pulses. By counting the pulses and computing the frequency of the pulse train, the
leadscrew angle and rotational speed can be determined, and thus worktable position and
speed can be calculated using the pitch of the leadscrew.
The equations describing the operation of a closed-loop positioning system are
analogous to those for an open-loop system. In the basic optical encoder, the angle
between slots in the disk must satisfy the following requirement:
a¼

360
ns

ð38:10Þ

where a ¼ angle between slots, degrees/slot; and ns ¼ the number of slots in the disk, slots/

generates a number of pulses given by

where np ¼ pulse count; Als ¼ angle of rotation of the leadscrew, degrees; and a ¼ angle

linear x-axis position of the worktable by factoring in the leadscrew pitch. Thus,

Similarly, the feed rate at which the worktable moves is obtained from the frequency of
the pulse train:
vt ¼ f r ¼

60 pf p
ns

ð38:13Þ

where vt ¼ table travel speed, mm/min (in/min); fr ¼ feed rate, mm/min (in/min);
p ¼ pitch, mm/rev (in/rev); fp ¼ frequency of the pulse train, Hz (pulses/sec); ns ¼
number of slots in the encoder disk, pulses/rev; and 60 converts seconds to minutes.
The speed relationship given by Eq. (38.7) is also valid for a closed-loop positioning
system.
The series of pulses generated by the encoder is compared with the coordinate
position and feed rate specified in the part program, and the difference is used by the
machine control unit to drive a servomotor that in turn drives the leadscrew and worktable.
As with the open-loop system, a gear reduction between the servomotor and the leadscrew
can also be used, so Eqs. (38.4) are applicable. A digital-to-analog converter is used to
convert the digital signals used by the MCU into a continuous analog signal to operate the
drive motor. Closed-loop NC systems of the type described here are appropriate when
there is force resisting the movement of the table. Most metal-machining operations fall
into this category, particularly those involving continuous path control such as milling and
turning.

An NC worktable is driven by a closed-loop positioning system consisting of a
servomotor, leadscrew, and optical encoder. The leadscrew has a pitch ¼ 5.0 mm
and is coupled to the motor shaft with a gear ratio of 4:1 (four turns of the motor for
each turn of the leadscrew). The optical encoder generates 100 pulses/rev of the
leadscrew. The table has been programmed to move a distance of 75.0 mm at a feed
rate ¼ 400 mm/min. Determine (a) how many pulses are received by the control system
to verify that the table has moved exactly 75.0 mm; and (b) the pulse rate and (c) motor
speed that correspond to the specified feed rate.

Precision in Positioning Three critical measures of precision in positioning are control
resolution, accuracy, and repeatability. These terms are most easily explained by considering a single axis of the position system.

Control resolution refers to the system’s ability to divide the total range of the axis
movement into closely spaced points that can be distinguished by the control unit.
Control resolution is defined as the distance separating two adjacent control points in
the axis movement. Control points are sometimes called addressable points because
they are locations along the axis to which the worktable can be directed to go. It is
desirable for the control resolution to be as small as possible. This depends on
limitations imposed by (1) the electromechanical components of the positioning
system, and/or (2) the number of bits used by the controller to define the axis coordinate
location.
The electromechanical factors that limit resolution include leadscrew pitch, gear
ratio in the drive system, and the step angle in a stepping motor (for an open-loop system) or
the angle between slots in an encoder disk (for a closed-loop system). Together, these
factors determine a control resolution, or minimum distance that the worktable can be
moved. For example, the control resolution for an open-loop system driven by a stepper
motor with a gear reduction between the motor shaft and the leadscrew is given by
p
CR1 ¼
ð38:14aÞ
ns r g
where CR1 ¼ control resolution of the electromechanical components, mm (in); p ¼
leadscrew pitch, mm/rev (in/rev); ns ¼ number of steps/rev; and rg ¼ gear reduction.
The corresponding expression for a closed-loop positioning system is similar but
does not include the gear reduction because the encoder is connected directly to the
leadscrew. There is no gear reduction. Thus, control resolution for a closed-loop system is
defined as follows:
p
CR1 ¼
ð38:14bÞ
ns
where ns in this case refers to the number of slots in the optical encoder.
Although unusual in modern computer technology, the second possible factor that
could limit control resolution is the number of bits defining the axis coordinate value. For
example, this limitation may be imposed by the bit storage capacity of the controller. If
B ¼ the number of bits in the storage register for the axis, then the number of control
points into which the axis range can be divided ¼ 2B. Assuming that the control points are
separated equally within the range, then
CR2 ¼

L
2 1
B

ð38:15Þ

where CR2 ¼ control resolution of the computer control system, mm (in); and L ¼ axis
range, mm (in). The control resolution of the positioning system is the maximum of the
two values; that is,
CR ¼ MaxfCR1 ; CR2 g

ð38:16Þ

It is generally desirable for CR2  CR1, meaning that the electromechanical system is the
limiting factor in control resolution.
When a positioning system is directed to move the worktable to a given control
point, the capability of the system to move to that point will be limited by mechanical
errors. These errors are due to a variety of inaccuracies and imperfections in the
mechanical system, such as play between the leadscrew and the worktable, backlash
in the gears, and deflection of machine components. It is convenient to assume that the
errors form a statistical distribution about the control point that is an unbiased normal
distribution with mean ¼ 0. If we further assume that the standard deviation of the
distribution is constant over the range of the axis under consideration, then nearly all of
the mechanical errors (99.73%) are contained within 3 standard deviations of the

control point. This is pictured in Figure 38.12 for a portion of the axis range, which
includes three control points.
Given these definitions of control resolution and mechanical error distribution, let
us now consider accuracy and repeatability. Accuracy is defined in a worst-case scenario
in which the desired target point lies exactly between two adjacent control points. Since
the system can only move to one or the other of the control points, there will be an error
in the final position of the worktable. If the target were closer to one of the control points,
then the table would be moved to the closer control point and the error would be smaller.
It is appropriate to define accuracy in the worst case. The accuracy of any given axis of a
positioning system is the maximum possible error that can occur between the desired
target point and the actual position taken by the system; in equation form,
Accuracy ¼ 0:5 CR þ 3s

ð38:17Þ

where CR ¼ control resolution, mm (in); and s ¼ standard deviation of the error
distribution, mm (in).
Repeatability refers to the capability of a positioning system to return to a given
control point that has been previously programmed. This capability can be measured in
terms of the location errors encountered when the system attempts to position itself at the
control point. Location errors are a manifestation of the mechanical errors of the
positioning system, which are defined by an assumed normal distribution, as described
above. Thus, the repeatability of any given axis of a positioning system can be defined as
the range of mechanical errors associated with the axis; this reduces to
Repeatability ¼ 3s

Referring back to Example 38.1, the mechanical inaccuracies in the open-loop positioning

38.3.3 NC PART PROGRAMMING
In machine tool applications, the task of programming the system is called NC part
programming because the program is prepared for a given part. It is usually accomplished by someone familiar with the metalworking process who has learned the
programming procedure for the particular equipment in the plant. For other processes,
other terms may be used for programming, but the principles are similar and a trained
individual is needed to prepare the program. Computer systems are used extensively to
prepare NC programs.
Part programming requires the programmer to define the points, lines, and surfaces of
the workpart in the axis system, and to control the movement of the cutting tool relative to
these defined part features. Several part programming techniques are available, the most
important of which are (1) manual part programming, (2) computer-assisted part programming, (3) CAD/CAM-assisted part programming, and (4) manual data input.
Manual Part Programming For simple point-to-point machining jobs, such as drilling
operations, manual programming is often the easiest and most economical method.
Manual part programming uses basic numerical data and special alphanumeric codes to
define the steps in the process. For example, to perform a drilling operation, a command
of the following type is entered:
n010x70:0 y85:5 f175 s500
Each ‘‘word’’ in the statement specifies a detail in the drilling operation. The n-word (n010)
is simply a sequence number for the statement. The x- and y-words indicate the x and y
coordinate positions (x ¼ 70.0 mm and y ¼ 85.5 mm). The f-word and s-word specify the
feed rate and spindle speed to be used in the drilling operation (feed rate ¼ 175 mm/min and
spindle speed ¼ 500 rev/min). The complete NC part program consists of a sequence of
statements similar to the above command.
Computer-Assisted Part Programming Computer-assisted part programming involves the use of a high-level programming language. It is suited to the programming
of more complex jobs than manual programming. The first part programming language
was APT (Automatically Programmed Tooling), developed as an extension of the
original NC machine tool research and first used in production around 1960.
In APT, the part programming task is divided into two steps: (1) definition of part
geometry and (2) specification of tool path and operation sequence. In step 1, the part
programmer defines the geometry of the workpart by means of basic geometric elements
such as points, lines, planes, circles, and cylinders. These elements are defined using APT
geometry statements, such as
P1 ¼ POINT=25:0; 150:0
L1 ¼ LINE=P1; P2
P1 is a point defined in the x-y plane located at x ¼ 25 mm and y ¼ 150 mm. L1 is a line
that goes through points P1 and P2. Similar statements can be used to define circles,

E1C38

11/09/2009

906

18:1:3

Page 906

Chapter 38/Automation Technologies for Manufacturing Systems

cylinders, and other geometry elements. Most workpart shapes can be described using
statements like these to define their surfaces, corners, edges, and hole locations.
Specification of the tool path is accomplished with APT motion statements.
A typical statement for point-to-point operation is
GOTO=P1
This directs the tool to move from its current location to a position defined by P1,
where P1 has been defined by a previous APT geometry statement. Continuous path
commands use geometry elements such as lines, circles, and planes. For example, the
command
GORGT=L3; PAST; L4
directs the tool to go right (GORGT) along line L3 until it is positioned just past line L4
(of course, L4 must be a line that intersects L3).
Additional APT statements are used to define operating parameters such as feed
rates, spindle speeds, tool sizes, and tolerances. When completed, the part programmer
enters the APT program into the computer, where it is processed to generate low-level
statements (similar to statements prepared in manual part programming) that can be
used by a particular machine tool.
CAD/CAM-Assisted Part Programming The use of CAD/CAM takes computerassisted part programming a step further by using a computer graphics system (CAD/
CAM system) to interact with the programmer as the part program is being prepared. In
the conventional use of APT, a complete program is written and then entered into the
computer for processing. Many programming errors are not detected until computer
processing. When a CAD/CAM system is used, the programmer receives immediate visual
verification when each statement is entered, to determine whether the statement is
correct. When part geometry is entered by the programmer, the element is graphically
displayed on the monitor. When the tool path is constructed, the programmer can see
exactly how the motion commands will move the tool relative to the part. Errors can be
corrected immediately rather than after the entire program has been written.
Interaction between programmer and programming system is a significant benefit
of CAD/CAM-assisted programming. There are other important benefits of using CAD/
CAM in NC part programming. First, the design of the product and its components may
have been accomplished on a CAD/CAM system. The resulting design database,
including the geometric definition of each part, can be retrieved by the NC programmer
to use as the starting geometry for part programming. This retrieval saves valuable time
compared to reconstructing the part from scratch using the APT geometry statements.
Second, special software routines are available in CAD/CAM-assisted part programming to automate portions of the tool path generation, such as profile milling
around the outside periphery of a part, milling a pocket into the surface of a part, surface
contouring, and certain point-to-point operations. These routines are called by the part
programmer as special macro commands. Their use results in significant savings in
programming time and effort.
Manual Data Input Manual data input (MDI) is a method in which a machine operator
enters the part program in the factory. The method involves use of a CRT display with
graphics capability at the machine tool controls. NC part programming statements are
entered using a menu-driven procedure that requires minimum training of the machine
tool operator. Because part programming is simplified and does not require a special staff
of NC part programmers, MDI is a way for small machine shops to economically
implement numerical control into their operations.

38.3.4 APPLICATIONS OF NUMERICAL CONTROL
Machining is an important application area for numerical control, but the operating
principle of NC can be applied to other operations as well. There are many industrial
processes in which the position of a workhead must be controlled relative to the part or
product being worked on. We divide the applications into two categories: (1) machine
tool applications, and (2) nonmachine tool applications. It should be noted that the
applications are not all identified by the name numerical control in their respective
industries.
In the machine tool category, NC is widely used for machining operations such as
turning, drilling, and milling (Sections 22.2, 22.3, and 22.4, respectively). The use of NC in
these processes has motivated the development of highly automated machine tools called
machining centers, which change their own cutting tools to perform a variety of
machining operations under NC program control (Section 22.5). In addition to machining, other numerically controlled machine tools include (1) grinding machines (Section
25.1); (2) sheet metal pressworking machines (Section 20.5.2); (3) tube-bending machines
(Section 20.7); and (4) thermal cutting processes (Section 26.3).
In the nonmachine tool category, NC applications include (1) tape-laying machines
and filament-winding machines for composites (Section 15.2.3 and Section 15.4);
(2) welding machines, both arc welding (Section 31.1) and resistance welding (Section
31.2); (3) component-insertion machines in electronics assembly (Sections 35.3 and 35.4);
(4) drafting machines; and (5) coordinate measuring machines for inspection (Section
42.6.1).
Benefits of NC relative to manually operated equipment in these applications
include (1) reduced nonproductive time, which results in shorter cycle times, (2) lower
manufacturing lead times, (3) simpler fixturing, (4) greater manufacturing flexibility, (5)
improved accuracy, and (6) reduced human error.

INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS
An industrial robot is a general-purpose programmable machine possessing certain anthropomorphic features. The most obvious anthropomorphic, or human-like, feature is the
robot’s mechanical arm, or manipulator. The control unit for a modern industrial robot is a
computer that can be programmed to execute rather sophisticated subroutines, thus
providing the robot with an intelligence that sometimes seems almost human. The robot’s
manipulator, combined with a high-level controller, allows an industrial robot to perform a
variety of tasks such as loading and unloading production machine, spot welding, and spray
painting. Robots are typically used as substitutes for human workers in these tasks. The first
industrial robot was installed in a die-casting operation at Ford Motor Company. The robot’s
job was to unload die castings from the die-casting machine.
In this section, we consider various aspects of robot technology and applications,
including how industrial robots are programmed to perform their tasks.

38.4.1 ROBOT ANATOMY
An industrial robot consists of a mechanical manipulator and a controller to move it and
perform other related functions. The mechanical manipulator consists of joints and links
that can position and orient the end of the manipulator relative to its base. The controller
unit consists of electronic hardware and software to operate the joints in a coordinated
fashion to execute the programmed work cycle. Robot anatomy is concerned with the

mechanical manipulator and its construction. Figure 38.13 shows one of the common
industrial robot configurations.
Manipulator Joints and Links A joint in a robot is similar to a joint in a human body. It
provides relative movement between two parts of the body. Connected to each joint are
an input link and an output link. Each joint moves its output link relative to its input link.
The robot manipulator consists of a series of link–joint–link combinations. The output
link of one joint is the input link for the next joint. Typical industrial robots have five or
six joints. The coordinated movement of these joints gives the robot its ability to move,
position, and orient objects to perform useful work. Manipulator joints can be classified
as linear or rotating, indicating the motion of the output link relative to the input link.
Manipulator Design Using joints of the two basic types, each joint separated from the
previous by a link, the manipulator is constructed. Most industrial robots are mounted to
the floor. We can identify the base as link 0; this is the input link to joint 1 whose output is
link 1, which is the input to joint 2 whose output link is link 2; and so forth, for the number
of joints in the manipulator.
Robot manipulators can usually be divided into two sections: arm-and-body
assembly and wrist assembly. There are typically three joints associated with the armand-body assembly, and two or three joints associated with the wrist. The function of the

E1C38

909

arm-and-body is to position an object or tool, and the wrist function is to properly orient
the object or tool. Positioning is concerned with moving the part or tool from one location
to another. Orientation is concerned with precisely aligning the object relative to some
stationary location in the work area.
To accomplish these functions, arm-and-body designs differ from those of the wrist.
Positioning requires large spatial movements, while orientation requires twisting and
rotating motions to align the part or tool relative to a fixed position in the workplace. The
arm-and-body consists of large links and joints, whereas the wrist consists of short links.
The arm-and-body joints often consist of both linear and rotating types, while the wrist
joints are almost always rotating types.
There are five basic arm-and-body configurations available in commercial robots,
identified in Figure 38.14. The design shown in part (e) of the figure and in Figure 38.13 is
called a SCARA robot, which stands for ‘‘selectively compliant assembly robot arm.’’ It
is similar to a jointed arm anatomy, except that the shoulder and elbow joints have
vertical axes of rotation, thus providing rigidity in the vertical direction but relative
compliance in the horizontal direction.

coordinate, (d) jointed-arm, and (e) SCARA, or selectively compliant assembly robot arm.

FIGURE 38.15 A robot
gripper: (a) open and
(b) closed to grasp a
workpart.

The wrist is assembled to the last link in any of these arm-and-body configurations. The SCARA is sometimes an exception because it is almost always
used for simple handling and assembly tasks involving vertical motions. Therefore,
a wrist is not usually present at the end of its manipulator. Substituting for the wrist on
the SCARA is usually a gripper to grasp components for movement and/or assembly.
Work Volume and Precision of Motion One of the important technical considerations
of an industrial robot is the size of its work volume. Work volume is defined as the
envelope within which a robot manipulator can position and orient the end of its wrist.
This envelope is determined by the number of joints, as well as their types and ranges, and
the sizes of the links. Work volume is important because it plays a significant role in
determining which applications a robot can perform.
The definitions of control resolution, accuracy, and repeatability developed in
Section 38.3.2 for NC positioning systems apply to industrial robots. A robot manipulator
is, after all, a positioning system. In general, the links and joints of robots are not nearly as
rigid as their machine tool counterparts, and so the accuracy and repeatability of their
movements are not as good.
End Effectors An industrial robot is a general-purpose machine. For a robot to be useful
in a particular application, it must be equipped with special tooling designed for the
application. An end effector is the special tooling that connects to the robot’s wrist-end to
perform the specific task. There are two general types of end effector: tools and grippers.
A tool is used when the robot must perform a processing operation. The special tools
include spot-welding guns, arc-welding tools, spray-painting nozzles, rotating spindles,
heating torches, and assembly tools (e.g., automatic screwdriver). The robot is programmed to manipulate the tool relative to the workpart being processed.
Grippers are designed to grasp and move objects during the work cycle. The objects
are usually workparts, and the end effector must be designed specifically for the part.
Grippers are used for part placement applications, machine loading and unloading, and
palletizing. Figure 38.15 shows a typical gripper configuration.

38.4.2 CONTROL SYSTEMS AND ROBOT PROGRAMMING
The robot’s controller consists of the electronic hardware and software to control the joints
during execution of a programmed work cycle. Most robot control units today are based on
a microcomputer system. The control systems in robotics can be classified as follows:

E1C38

11/09/2009

18:1:4

Page 911

Section 38.4/Industrial Robotics

911

1. Playback with point-to-point (PTP) control. As in numerical control, robot motion
systems can be divided into point-to-point and continuous path. The program for a
point-to-point playback robot consists of a series of point locations and the sequence in
which these points must be visited during the work cycle. During programming, these
points are recorded into memory, and then subsequently played back during execution
of the program. In a point-to-point motion, the path taken to get to the final position is
not controlled.
2. Playback with continuous path (CP) control. Continuous path control is similar to
PTP, except motion paths rather than individual points are stored in memory. In certain
types of regular CP motions, such as a straight line path between two point locations,
the trajectory required by the manipulator is computed by the controller unit for each
move. For irregular continuous motions, such as a path followed in spray painting, the
path is defined by a series of closely spaced points that approximate the irregular
smooth path. Robots capable of continuous path motions can also execute point-topoint movements.
3. Intelligent control. Modern industrial robots exhibit characteristics that often make
them appear to be acting intelligently. These characteristics include the ability to
respond to sophisticated sensors such as machine vision, make decisions when things go
wrong during the work cycle, make computations, and communicate with humans.
Robot intelligence is implemented using powerful microprocessors and advanced
programming techniques.
Robots execute a stored program of instructions that define the sequence
of motions and positions in the work cycle, much like a part program in NC. In addition
to motion instructions, the program may include instructions for other functions such as
interacting with external equipment, responding to sensors, and processing data.
There are two basic methods used to teach modern robots their programs: leadthrough programming and computer programming languages. Leadthrough programming
involves a ‘‘teach-by-showing’’ method in which the manipulator is moved by the programmer through the sequence of positions in the work cycle. The controller records each
position in memory for subsequent playback. Two procedures for leading the robot through
the motion sequence are available: powered leadthrough and manual leadthrough. In
powered leadthrough, the manipulator is driven by a control box that has toggle switches or
press buttons to control the movements of the joints. Using the control box, the programmer moves the manipulator to each location, recording the corresponding joint positions
into memory. Powered leadthrough is the common method for programming playback
robots with point-to-point control. Manual leadthrough is typically used for playback
robots with continuous path control. In this method, the programmer physically moves the
manipulator wrist through the motion cycle. For spray painting and certain other jobs, this is
a more convenient means of programming the robot.
Computer programming languages for programming robots have evolved from the
use of microcomputer controllers. The first commercial language was introduced around
1979. Computer languages provide a convenient way to integrate certain nonmotion
functions into the work cycle, such as decision logic, interlocking with other equipment,
and interfacing with sensors. A more thorough discussion of robot programming is
presented in reference [6].

38.4.3 APPLICATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS
Some industrial work lends itself to robot applications. The following are the important
characteristics of a work situation that tend to promote the substitution of a robot in place
of a human worker: (1) the work environment is hazardous for humans, (2) the work cycle

E1C38

11/09/2009

912

18:1:4

Page 912

Chapter 38/Automation Technologies for Manufacturing Systems

is repetitive, (3) the work is performed at a stationary location, (4) part or tool handling
would be difficult for humans, (5) it is a multishift operation, (6) there are long
production runs and infrequent changeovers, and (7) part positioning and orientation
are established at the beginning of the work cycle, since most robots cannot see.
Applications of industrial robots that tend to match these characteristics can be
divided into three basic categories: (1) material handling, (2) processing operations, and
(3) assembly and inspection.
Material handling applications involve the movement of materials or parts from
one location and orientation to another. To accomplish this relocation task, the robot is
equipped with a gripper. As noted earlier, the gripper must be custom-designed to
grasp the particular part in the application. Material handling applications include
material transfer (part placement, palletizing, depalletizing) and machine loading and/
or unloading (e.g., machine tools, presses, and plastic molding).
Processing operations require the robot to manipulate a tool as its end effector. The
applications include spot welding, continuous arc welding, spray coating, and certain
metal cutting and deburring operations in which the robot manipulates a special tool. In
each of these operations, the tool is used as the robot’s end effector. An application of
spot welding is illustrated in Figure 38.16. Spot welding is a common application of
industrial robots in the automotive industry.
Assembly and inspection applications cannot be classified neatly in either of the
previous categories; they sometimes involve part handling and other times manipulation
of a tool. Assembly applications often involve the stacking of one part onto another
part—basically a part handling task. In other assembly operations a tool is manipulated,
such as an automatic screwdriver. Similarly, inspection operations sometimes require the
robot to position a workpart relative to an inspection device, or to load a part into an
inspection machine; other applications involve the manipulation of a sensor to perform
an inspection.

The manufacturing systems discussed in this chapter consist
of multiple workstations and/or machines whose operations
are integrated by means of a material handling subsystem
that moves parts or products between stations. In addition,
most of these systems use computer control to coordinate the
actions of the stations and material handling equipment and
to collect data on overall system performance. Thus, the
components of an integrated manufacturing system are
(1) workstations and/or machines, (2) material handling equipment, and (3) computer control. In addition, human workers
are required to manage the system, and workers may be
used to operate the individual workstations and machines.
Integrated manufacturing systems include manual and
automated production lines, manufacturing cells (from
which the term ‘‘cellular manufacturing’’ is derived), and
flexible manufacturing systems, all of which are described in
this chapter. In the final section we define computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), the ultimate integrated manufacturing system. Let us begin by providing a concise
overview of material handling, the physical integrator in
integrated manufacturing systems.

MATERIAL HANDLING

Material handling is defined as ‘‘the movement, storage,
protection and control of materials throughout the manufacturing and distribution process’’1 The term is usually associated with activities that occur inside a facility, as contrasted
with transportation between facilities that involves rail, truck,
air, or waterway delivery of goods.
Materials must be moved during the sequence of manufacturing operations that convert them into final product.
This definition is published each year in the Annual Report of the
Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA), the trade association
for material handling companies doing business in North America.

Section 39.1/Material Handling

919

Material handling functions in manufacturing include (1) loading and positioning work units
at each workstation, (2) unloading work units from the station, and (3) transporting work
units between workstations. Loading involves moving the work units into the production
machine from a location in close proximity to or within the workstation. Positioning means
locating the work units in a fixed orientation relative to the processing or assembly
operation. At the end of the operation, the work units are unloaded or removed from the
station. Loading and unloading are accomplished manually or by automated devices such
as industrial robots. If the manufacturing operations require multiple workstations, then
the units must be transported from one station to the next in the sequence. In many cases, a
temporary storage function must also be provided by the material handling system, as
work units await their turn at each workstation. The purpose of storage in this instance is to
make sure that work is always present at each station, so that idle time of workers and
equipment is avoided.
Material handling equipment and methods used in manufacturing can be divided
into the following general categories: (1) material transport, (2) storage, and (3) unitizing.
Material transport equipment is used to move parts and materials between workstations in the factory. This movement may include intermediate stops for temporary storage
of work-in-process. There are five main types of material transport equipment: (1) industrial
trucks, the most important of which are fork lift trucks, (2) automated guided vehicles,
(3) rail-guided vehicles, (4) conveyors, and (5) hoists and cranes. This equipment is briefly
described in Table 39.1.
Two general categories of material transport equipment can be distinguished,
according to the type of routing between workstations: fixed and variable. In fixed routing,
all of the work units are moved through the same sequence of stations. This implies that the
processing sequence required on all work units is either identical or very similar. Fixed
routing is used on manual assembly lines and automated production lines. Typical material
handling equipment used in fixed routing includes conveyors and rail-guided vehicles. In
variable routing, different work units are moved through different workstation sequences,
meaning that the manufacturing system processes or assembles different types of parts or
products. Manufacturing cells and flexible manufacturing systems usually operate this way.
Typical handling equipment found in variable routing includes industrial trucks, automated
guided vehicles, and hoists and cranes.
Storage systems in factories are used for temporary storage of raw materials, work-inprocess, and finished products. Storage systems can be classified into two general categories:

systems served by automatic cranes that store and retrieve pallet loads.
Finally, unitizing refers to containers used to hold individual items during transport
and storage, as well as equipment used to make up such unit loads. Containers include
pallets, tote pans, boxes, and baskets that hold parts during handling. Unitizing equipment
includes palletizers that are used to load and stack cartons onto pallets and depalletizers
that are used to accomplish the unloading operation. Palletizers and depalletizers are
generally associated with cartons of finished product leaving a facility and boxes of raw
materials coming into the facility, respectively.
In Section 1.4.1, we described four types of plant layout: (1) fixed position layout,
(2) process layout, (3) cellular layout, and (4) product layout. In general, different types of
material handling methods and equipment are associated with these four types, as
summarized in Table 39.2.

39.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF PRODUCTION LINES
Production lines are an important class of manufacturing system when large quantities of
identical or similar products are to be made. They are suited to situations where the total work
to be performed on the product or part consists of many separate steps. Examples include

assembled products (e.g., automobiles and appliances) and mass-produced machined parts
on which multiple machining operations are required (e.g., engine blocks and transmission
housings). In a production line, the total work is divided into small tasks, and workers or
machines perform these tasks with great efficiency. For purposes of organization we divide
production lines into two basic types: manual assembly lines and automated production lines.
However, hybrid lines consisting of both manual and automated operations are not
uncommon. Before examining these particular systems, let us consider some of the general
issues involved in production line design and operation.
A production line consists of a series of workstations arranged so that the product
moves from one station to the next, and at each location a portion of the total work is
performed on it, as depicted in Figure 39.2. The production rate of the line is limited by its
slowest station. Workstations whose pace is faster than the slowest will ultimately be limited
by that bottleneck station. Transfer of the product along the line is usually accomplished by
a conveyor system or mechanical transfer device, although some manual lines simply pass
the product from worker to worker by hand. Production lines are associated with mass
production. If the product quantities are high and the work can be divided into separate
tasks that can be assigned to individual workstations, then a production line is the most
appropriate manufacturing system.

39.2.1 METHODS OF WORK TRANSPORT
There are various ways of moving work units from one workstation to the next. The two
basic categories are manual and mechanized.

Manual Methods of Work Transport Manual methods involve passing the work
units between stations by hand. These methods are associated with manual assembly
lines. In some cases, the output of each station is collected in a box or tote pan; when the
box is full it is moved to the next station. This can result in a significant amount of inprocess inventory, which is undesirable. In other cases, work units are moved individually
along a flat table or unpowered conveyor (e.g., a roller conveyor). When the task is
finished at each station, the worker simply pushes the unit toward the downstream
station. Space is usually allowed for one or more units to collect between stations, thereby
relaxing the requirement for all workers to perform their respective tasks in sync. One
problem associated with manual methods of work transport is the difficulty in controlling
the production rate on the line. Workers tend to work at a slower pace unless some
mechanical means of pacing them is provided.
Mechanized Methods of Work Transport Powered mechanical systems are commonly used to move work units along a production line. These systems include lift-and-carry
devices, pick-and-place mechanisms, powered conveyors (e.g., overhead chain conveyors,
belt conveyors, and chain-in-floor conveyors), and other material handling equipment,

E1C39

Chapter 39/Integrated Manufacturing Systems

sometimes combining several types on the same line. Three major types of work transfer
systems are used on production lines: (1) continuous transfer, (2) synchronous transfer, and
(3) asynchronous transfer.
Continuous transfer systems consist of a continuously moving conveyor that operates at
a constant velocity. The continuous transfer system is most common on manual assembly lines.
Two cases are distinguished: (1) parts are fixed to the conveyor and (2) parts can be removed
from the conveyor. In the first case, the product is usually large and heavy (e.g., automobile,
washing machine) and cannot be removed from the line. The worker must therefore walk
along with the moving conveyor to complete the assigned task for that unit while it is in the
station. In the second case, the product is small enough that it can be removed from the
conveyor to facilitate the work at each station. Some of the pacing benefits are lost in this
arrangement, since each worker is not required to finish the assigned tasks within a fixed
time period. On the other hand, this case allows greater flexibility to each worker to deal
with any technical problems that may be encountered on a particular work unit.
In synchronous transfer systems, work units are simultaneously moved between stations
with a quick, discontinuous motion. These systems are also known by the name intermittent
transfer, which characterizes the type of motion experienced by the work units. Synchronous
transfer includes positioning of the work at the stations, which is a requirement for automated
lines that use this mode of transfer. Synchronous transfer is not common for manual lines,
because the task at each and every station must be finished within the cycle time or the product
will leave the station as an incomplete unit. This rigid pacing discipline is stressful to human
workers. By contrast, this type of pacing lends itself to automated operation.
Asynchronous transfer allows each work unit to depart its current station when
processing has been completed. Each unit moves independently, rather than synchronously. Thus, at any given moment, some units on the line are moving between stations,
while others are positioned at stations. Associated with the operation of an asynchronous
transfer system is the tactical use of queues between stations. Small queues of work units
are permitted to form in front of each station, so that variations in worker task times will be
averaged and stations will always have work waiting for them. Asynchronous transfer is
used for both manual and automated production systems.

39.2.2 PRODUCT VARIATIONS
Production lines can be designed to cope with variations in product models. Three types of
line can be distinguished: (1) single model line, (2) batch model line, and (3) mixed model
line. A single model line is one that produces only one model, and there is no variation in
the model. Thus, the tasks performed at each station are the same on all product units.
Batch model and mixed model lines are designed to produce two or more different
product models on the same line, but they use different approaches for dealing with the
model variations. As its name suggests, a batch model line produces each model in batches.
The workstations are set up to produce the desired quantity of the first model; then the
stations are reconfigured to produce the desired quantity of the next model; and so on.
Production time is lost between batches due to the setup changes. Assembled products are
often made using this approach when the demand for each product is medium and the
product variety is also medium. The economics in this case favor the use of one production
line for several products rather than using many separate lines for each model.
A mixed model line also produces multiple models; however, the models are
intermixed on the same line rather than being produced in batches. While a particular
model is being worked on at one station, a different model is being processed at the next
station. Each station is equipped with the necessary tools and is sufficiently versatile to
perform the variety of tasks needed to produce any model that moves through it. Many
consumer products are assembled on mixed model lines when the level of product variety is

soft. Prime examples are automobiles and major appliances, which are characterized by
variations in models and options.

39.3

MANUAL ASSEMBLY LINES
The manual assembly line was an important development in integrated manufacturing
systems. It is of global importance today in the manufacture of assembled products
including automobiles and trucks, consumer electronic products, appliances, power tools,
and other products made in large quantities.
A manual assembly line consists of multiple workstations arranged sequentially, at
which assembly operations are performed by human workers, as in Figure 39.3. The usual
procedure on a manual line begins with ‘‘launching’’ a base part onto the front end of the line.
Awork carrier is often required to hold the part during its movement along the line. The base
part travels through each of the stations where workers perform tasks that progressively build
the product. Components are added to the base part at each station, so that all tasks have been
completed when the product exits the final station. Processes accomplished on manual
assembly lines include mechanical fastening operations (Chapter 32), spot welding (Section
30.2), hand soldering (Section 31.2), and adhesive joining (Section 31.3).

39.3.1 CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS
Equations can be developed to determine the required number of workers and workstations on a manual assembly line to meet a given annual demand. Suppose the problem is
to design a single model line to satisfy annual demand for a certain product. Management
must decide how many shifts per week the line will operate and the number of hours per
shift. If we assume 50 weeks per year, then the required hourly production rate of the line
will be given by

where Rp ¼ the actual average production rate, units/hr; Da ¼ annual demand for the
product, units/yr; Sw ¼ number of shifts/wk; and Hsh ¼ hr/shift. If the line operates 52 weeks
rather than 50, then Rp ¼ Da/52SwHsh. The corresponding average production time per unit
is the reciprocal of Rp
Tp ¼

ð39:2Þ

where Tp ¼ actual average production time, converted to minutes.
Unfortunately, the line may not be able to operate for the entire time given by 50
SwHsh, because of lost time due to reliability problems. These reliability problems include
mechanical and electrical failures, tools wearing out, power outages, and similar malfunctions. Accordingly, the line must operate at a faster time than Tp to compensate for these
problems. If E ¼ line efficiency, which is the proportion of uptime on the line, then the cycle
time of the line Tc is given by
T c ¼ ET p ¼

ð39:3Þ

Any product contains a certain work content that represents all of the tasks that are to
be accomplished on the line. This work content requires an amount of time called the work
content time Twc. This is the total time required to make the product on the line. If we
assume that the work content time can be divided evenly among the workers, so that every
worker has an equal workload whose time to perform equals Tc, then the minimum possible
number of workers wmin in the line can be determined as
wmin ¼ Minimum Integer 

T wc
Tc

ð39:4Þ

If each worker is assigned to a separate workstation, then the number of workstations is
equal to the number of workers; that is nmin ¼ wmin.
There are two practical reasons why this minimum number of workers cannot be
achieved: (1) imperfect balancing, in which some workers are assigned an amount of work
that requires less time than Tc, and this inefficiency increases the total number of workers
needed on the line; and (2) repositioning losses, in which some time is lost at each station
to reposition the work or the worker, so that the service time actually available at each
station is less than Tc, and this will also increase the number of workers on the line.

39.3.2 LINE BALANCING AND REPOSITIONING LOSSES
One of the biggest technical problems in designing and operating a manual assembly line is
line balancing. This is the problem of assigning tasks to individual workers so that all workers
have an equal amount of work. Recall that the entirety of work to be accomplished on the line
is given by the work content. This total work content can be divided into minimum rational
work elements, each element concerned with adding a component or joining them or
performing some other small portion of the total work content. The notion of a minimum
rational work element is that it is the smallest practical amount of work into which the total
job can be divided. Different work elements require different times, and when they are
grouped into logical tasks and assigned to workers, the task times will not be equal. Thus,
simply due to the variable nature of element times, some workers will end up with more work,
while other workers will have less. The cycle time of the assembly line is determined by the
station with the longest task time.
One might think that although the work element times are different, it should be
possible to find groups of elements whose sums (task times) are nearly equal, if not

E1C39

16:54:49

Page 925

Section 39.3/Manual Assembly Lines

925

perfectly equal. What makes it difficult to find suitable groups is that there are several
constraints on this combinatorial problem. First, the line must be designed to achieve some
desired production rate, which establishes the cycle time Tc at which the line must operate,
as provided by Eq. (39.3). Therefore, the sum of the work element times assigned to each
station must be less than or equal to Tc.
Second, there are restrictions on the order in which the work elements can be
performed. Some elements must be done before others. For example, a hole must be drilled
before it can be tapped. A screw that will use the tapped hole to attach a mating component
cannot be fastened before the hole has been drilled and tapped. These kinds of requirements
on the work sequence are called precedence constraints. They complicate the line balancing
problem. A certain element that might be allocated to a worker to obtain a task time ¼ Tc
cannot be added because it violates a precedence constraint.
These and other limitations make it virtually impossible to achieve perfect balancing of
the line, which means that some workers will require more time to complete their tasks than
others. Methods of solving the line balancing problem, that is, allocating work elements to
stations, are discussed in other references—excellent references indeed, such as [10]. The
inability to achieve perfect balancing results in some idle time at most stations. Because of this
idle time, the actual number of workers required on the line will be greater than the number of
workstations given by Eq. (39.4).
A measure of the total idle time on a manual assembly line is given by the balancing
efficiency Eb, defined as the total work content time divided by the total available service time
on the line. The total work content time is equal to the sum of the times of all work elements
that are to be accomplished on the line. The total available service time on the line ¼ wTs,
where w ¼ number of workers on the line; and Ts ¼ the longest service time on the line; that is,
Ts ¼ Max{Tsi} for i ¼ 1, 2, . . . n, where Tsi ¼ the service time (task time) at station i, min.
The reader may wonder why we are using a new term Ts rather than the previously
defined cycle time Tc. The reason is that there is another time loss in the operation of a
production line in addition to idle time from imperfect balancing. Let us call it the
repositioning time Tr. It is the time required in each cycle to reposition the worker, or
the work unit, or both. On a continuous transfer line where work units are attached to the
line and move at a constant speed, Tr is the time taken by the worker to walk from the unit
just completed to the next unit coming into the station. In all manual assembly lines, there
will be some lost time due to repositioning. We assume that Tr is the same for all workers,
although in fact repositioning may require different times at different stations. We can relate
Ts, Tc, and Tr as follows:
Tc ¼ Ts þ Tr

ð39:5Þ

The definition of balancing efficiency Eb can now be written in equation form as follows:
Eb ¼

T wc
wT s

ð39:6Þ

A perfect line balance yields a value of Eb ¼ 1.00. Typical line balancing efficiencies in
industry range between 0.90 and 0.95.
Equation (39.6) can be rearranged to obtain the actual number of workers required

The utility of this relationship suffers from the fact that the balancing efficiency Eb depends
on w in Eq. (39.6). Unfortunately, we have an equation where the thing to be determined
depends on a parameter that, in turn, depends on the thing itself. Notwithstanding this
drawback, Eq. (39.7) defines the relationship among the parameters in a manual assembly

line. Using a typical value of Eb based on similar previous lines, it can be used to estimate the
number of workers required to produce a given assembly.

Example 39.1
Manual Assembly
Line

A manual assembly line is being planned for a product whose annual demand ¼ 90,000
units. A continuously moving conveyor will be used with work units attached. Work
content time ¼ 55 min. The line will run 50 wk/yr, 5 shifts/wk, and 8 hr/day. Each worker
will be assigned to a separate workstation. Based on previous experience, assume line
efficiency ¼ 0.95, balancing efficiency ¼ 0.93, and repositioning time ¼ 9 sec. Determine
(a) hourly production rate to meet demand, (b) number of workers and workstations
required, and (c) for comparison, the ideal minimum value as given by wmin as given by
Eq. (39.4).
Solution: (a) Hourly production rate required to meet annual demand is given by
Eq. (39.1):
90; 000
Rp ¼
¼ 45 units=hr
50(5)(8)
(b) With a line efficiency of 0.95, the ideal cycle time is
Tc ¼

60(0:95)
¼ 1:2667 min
45

Given that repositioning time Tr ¼ 9 sec ¼ 0.15 min, the service time is
T s ¼ 1:2667  0:150 ¼ 1:1167 min
Workers required to operate the line, by Eq. (39.7) equals
w ¼ Minimum Integer 

55
¼ 52:96 ! 53 workers
1:1167(0:93)

With one worker per station, n ¼ 53 workstations.
(c) This compares with the ideal minimum number of workers given by Eq. (39.4):
wmin ¼ Minimum Integer 

55
¼ 43:42 ! 44 workers
1:2667

It is clear that lost time due to repositioning and imperfect line balancing take their toll in
n
the overall efficiency of a manual assembly line.
The number of workstations on a manual assembly line does not necessarily equal the
number of workers. For large products, it may be possible to assign more than one worker to
a station. This practice is common in final assembly plants that build cars and trucks. For
example, two workers in a station might perform assembly tasks on opposite sides of the
vehicle. The number of workers in a given station is called the station manning level Mi.
Averaging the manning levels over the entire line,
M¼

w
n

ð39:8Þ

where M ¼ average manning level for the assembly line; w ¼ number of workers on the line;
and n ¼ number of stations. Naturally, w and n must be integers. Multiple manning conserves
valuable floor space in the factory because it reduces the number of stations required.
Another factor that affects manning level on an assembly line is the number of
automated stations on the line, including stations that employ industrial robots (Section
38.4). Automation reduces the required labor force on the line, although it increases the
need for technically trained personnel to service and maintain the automated stations. The

automobile industry makes extensive use of robotic workstations to perform spot welding
and spray painting on sheet-metal car bodies. The robots accomplish these operations with
greater repeatability than human workers can, which translates into higher product quality.

39.4

AUTOMATED PRODUCTION LINES
Manual assembly lines generally use a mechanized transfer system to move parts between
workstations, but the stations themselves are operated by human workers. An automated
production line consists of automated workstations connected by a parts transfer system
that is coordinated with the stations. In the ideal, no human workers are on the line, except
to perform auxiliary functions such as tool changing, loading and unloading parts at the
beginning and end of the line, and repair and maintenance activities. Modern automated
lines are highly integrated systems, operating under computer control.
Operations performed by automated stations tend to be simpler than those performed by humans on manual lines. The reason is that simpler tasks are easier to automate.
Operations that are difficult to automate are those requiring multiple steps, judgment, or
human sensory capability. Tasks that are easy to automate consist of single work elements,
quick actuating motions, and straight-line feed motions as in machining.

39.4.1 TYPES OF AUTOMATED LINES
Automated production lines can be divided into two basic categories: (1) those that
perform processing operations such as machining, and (2) those that perform assembly
operations. An important type in the processing category is the transfer line.

Transfer Lines and Similar Processing Systems A transfer line consists of a
sequence of workstations that perform production operations, with automatic transfer
of work units between stations. Machining is the most common processing operation, as
depicted in Figure 39.4. Automatic transfer systems for sheet metalworking and assembly
are also available. In the case of machining, the workpiece typically starts as a metal
casting or forging, and a series of machining operations are performed to accomplish the
high-precision details (e.g., holes, threads, and finished flat surfaces).

Chapter 39/Integrated Manufacturing Systems

FIGURE 39.5
Configuration of a
dial-indexing machine.

Transfer lines are usually expensive pieces of equipment, sometimes costing millions of
dollars; they are designed for high part quantities. The amount of machining accomplished on
the workpart is often significant, but since the work is divided among many stations,
production rates are high and unit costs are low compared to alternative production methods.
Synchronous transfer of work units between stations is commonly used on automated
machining lines.
A variation of the automated transfer line is the dial indexing machine, Figure 39.5,
in which workstations are arranged around a circular worktable, called a dial. The worktable is actuated by a mechanism that provides partial rotation of the table on each work
cycle. The number of rotational positions is designed to match the number of workstations
around the periphery of the table. Although the configuration of a dial-indexing machine is
quite different from a transfer line, its operation and application are quite similar.

Automated Assembly Systems Automated assembly systems consist of one or more
workstations that perform assembly operations, such as adding components and/or affixing
them to the work unit. Automated assembly systems can be divided into single station cells
and multiple station systems. Single station assembly cells are often organized around an
industrial robot that has been programmed to perform a sequence of assembly steps. The
robot cannot work as fast as a series of specialized automatic stations, so single station cells
are used for jobs in the medium production range.
Multiple station assembly systems are appropriate for high production. They are
widely used for mass production of small products such as ball-point pens, cigarette lighters,
flashlights, and similar items consisting of a limited number of components. The number of
components and assembly steps is limited because system reliability decreases rapidly with
increasing complexity.
Multiple station assembly systems are available in several configurations, pictured in

transfer line adapted to perform assembly work. These systems are not as massive as their
machining counterparts. Rotary systems are usually implemented as dial indexing machines.
Carousel assembly systems are arranged as a loop. They can be designed with a greater number
of workstations than a rotary system. Owing to the loop configuration, the carousel allows the
work carriers to be automatically returned to the starting point for reuse, an advantage shared
with rotary systems but not with transfer lines unless provision for their return is made in the
design.

39.4.2 ANALYSIS OF AUTOMATED PRODUCTION LINES
Line balancing is a problem on an automated line, just as it is on a manual assembly line.
The total work content must be allocated to individual workstations. However, since the
tasks assigned to automated stations are generally simpler, and the line often contains
fewer stations, the problem of defining what work should be done at each station is not as
difficult for an automated line as for a manual line.
A more significant problem in automated lines is reliability. The line consists of multiple
stations, interconnected by a work transfer system. It operates as an integrated system, and
when one station malfunctions, the entire system is adversely affected. To analyze the
operation of an automated production line, let us assume a system that performs processing
operations and uses synchronous transfer. This model includes transfer lines as well as dial
indexing machines. It does not include automated assembly systems, which require an
adaptation of the model [10]. Our terminology will borrow symbols from the first two sections:
n ¼ number of workstations on the line; Tc ¼ ideal cycle time on the line; Tr ¼ repositioning
time, called the transfer time in a transfer line; and Tsi ¼ the service time at station i. The ideal
cycle time Tc is the service time (processing time) for the slowest station on the line plus the
transfer time; that is,
T c ¼ T r þ MaxfT si g

ð39:9Þ

In the operation of a transfer line, periodic breakdowns cause downtime on the entire
line. Let F ¼ frequency with which breakdowns occur, causing a line stoppage; and Td ¼
average time the line is down when a breakdown occurs. The downtime includes the time for
the repair crew to swing into action, diagnose the cause of the failure, fix it, and restart the line.
Based on these definitions, we can formulate the following expression for the actual
average production time Tp:
T p ¼ T c þ FT d

ð39:10Þ

where F ¼ downtime frequency, line stops/cycle; and Td ¼ downtime in minutes per line stop.
Thus, FTd ¼ average downtime per cycle. The actual average production rate Rp ¼ 60/Tp, as
previously given in Eq. (39.2). It is of interest to compare this rate with the ideal production
rate given by
Rc ¼

60
Tc

ð39:11Þ

where Rp and Rc are expressed in pc/hr, given that Tp and Tc are expressed in minutes.
Based on these definitions, we can define the line efficiency E for a transfer line. In
the context of automated production systems, E refers to the proportion of uptime on the
line and is more a measure of reliability than efficiency:
E¼

Tc
T c þ FT d

ð39:12Þ

E1C39

11/11/2009

930

16:54:54

Page 930

Chapter 39/Integrated Manufacturing Systems

This is the same relationship as earlier Eq. (39.3), since Tp ¼ Tc þ FTd. It should be noted
that the same definition of line efficiency applies to manual assembly lines, except that
technological breakdowns are not as much of a problem on manual lines (human workers
are more reliable than electromechanical equipment, at least in the sense we are
discussing here).
Line downtime is usually associated with failures at individual workstations.
Reasons for downtime include scheduled and unscheduled tool changes, mechanical
and electrical malfunctions, hydraulic failures, and normal equipment wear. Let pi ¼
probability or frequency of a failure at station i, then
F¼

n
X

pi

ð39:13Þ

i1

If all pi are assumed equal, or an average value of pi is computed, in either case calling it p,
then
F ¼ np

ð39:14Þ

Both of these equations clearly indicate that the frequency of line stops increases with the
number of stations on the line. Stated another way, reliability of the line decreases as we add
more stations.

Example 39.2
Automated
Transfer Line

An automated transfer line has 20 stations and an ideal cycle time of 1.0 min. Probability of
a station failure is p ¼ 0.01, and the average downtime when a breakdown occurs is 10 min.
Determine (a) average production rate Rp and (b) line efficiency E.
Solution: The frequency of breakdowns on the line is given by F ¼ pn ¼ 0.01(20) ¼ 0.20.
The actual average production time is therefore
T p ¼ 1:0 þ 0:20(10) ¼ 3:0 min
(a) Production rate is therefore
Rp ¼

60
60
¼
¼ 20 pc/hr
T p 3:0

Note that this is far lower than the ideal production rate:
Rc ¼

60
60
¼
¼ 60 pc/hr
T c 1:0

(b) Line efficiency is computed as
E¼

T c 1:0
¼
¼ 0:333(or 33:3%)
T p 3:0

From this example we see that if a production line operates like this, it spends more time down
n
than up. Achieving high efficiencies is a real problem in automated production lines.
The cost of operating an automated production line is the investment cost of the
equipment and installation, plus the cost of maintenance, utilities, and labor assigned
to the line. These costs are converted to an equivalent uniform annual cost and
divided by the number of hours of operation per year to provide an hourly rate. This
hourly cost rate can be used to figure the unit cost of processing a workpart on the
line

where Cp ¼ unit processing cost, $/part; Co ¼ hourly rate of operating the line, as defined
above, $/hr; Tp ¼ actual average production time per workpart, min/part; and the
constant 60 converts the hourly cost rate to $/min for consistency of units.

39.5

CELLULAR MANUFACTURING
Cellular manufacturing refers to the use of work cells that specialize in the production of
families of parts or products made in medium quantities. Parts (and products) in this
quantity range are traditionally made in batches, and batch production requires downtime
for setup changeovers and has high inventory carrying costs. Cellular manufacturing is based
on an approach called group technology (GT), which minimizes the disadvantages of batch
production by recognizing that although the parts are different, they also possess similarities.
When these similarities are exploited in production, operating efficiencies are improved.
The improvement is typically achieved by organizing the production around manufacturing
cells. Each cell is designed to produce one part family (or a limited number of part families),
thereby following the principle of specialization of operations. The cell includes special
production equipment and custom-designed tools and fixtures, so that the production of the
part families can be optimized. In effect, each cell becomes a factory within the factory.

39.5.1 PART FAMILIES
A central feature of cellular manufacturing and group technology is the part family. A part
family is a group of parts that possess similarities in geometric shape and size, or in the
processing steps used in their manufacture. It is not unusual for a factory that produces 10,000
different parts to be able to group most of those parts into 20 to 30 part families. In each part
familytheprocessingstepsaresimilar.Thereare always differencesamongpartsinafamily,but
the similarities are close enough that the parts can be grouped into the same family. Figures 39.7
and 39.8 show two different part families. The parts shown in Figure 39.7 have the same size and
shape; however, their processing requirements are quite different because of differences in
work material, production quantities, and design tolerances. Figure 39.8 shows several parts
with geometries that differ, but their manufacturing requirements are quite similar.
There are several ways by which part families are identified in industry. One method
involves visual inspection of all the parts made in the factory (or photos of the parts) and using
best judgment to group them into appropriate families. Another approach, called production
flow analysis, uses information contained on route sheets (Section 40.1.1) to classify parts. In
effect, parts with similar manufacturing steps are grouped into the same family.
A third method, usually the most expensive but most useful, is parts classification and
coding. Parts classification and coding involve the identification of similarities and differences among parts and relating these parts by means of a numerical coding scheme. Most
classification and coding systems are one of the following: (1) systems based on part design

attributes, (2) systems based on part manufacturing attributes, and (3) systems based on
both design and manufacturing attributes. Common part design and manufacturing
attributes used in GT systems are presented in Table 39.3. Because each company
produces a unique set of parts and products, a classification and coding system that
may be satisfactory for one company is not necessarily appropriate for another company.
Each company must design its own coding scheme. Parts classification and coding systems
are described more thoroughly in several of our references [8], [10], [11].
Benefits often cited for a well-designed classification and coding system include
(1) facilitates formation of part families, (2) permits quick retrieval of part design
drawings, (3) reduces design duplication because similar or identical part designs can
be retrieved and reused rather than designed from scratch, (4) promotes design standardization, (5) improves cost estimating and cost accounting, (6) facilitates numerical control
(NC) part programming by allowing new parts to use the same basic part program as
existing parts in the same family, (7) allows sharing of tools and fixtures, and (8) aids
computer-aided process planning (Section 40.1.3) because standard process plans can be
correlated to part family code numbers, so that existing process plans can be reused or
edited for new parts in the same family.

and (b) the individual features of the composite part.

39.5.2 MACHINE CELLS
To fully exploit the similarities among parts in a family, production should be organized using
machine cells designed to specialize in making those particular parts. One of the principles in
designing a group technology machine cell is the composite part concept.

Composite Part Concept Members of a part family possess similar design and/or
manufacturing features. There is usually a correlation between part design features and
the manufacturing operations that produce those features. Round holes are made by drilling;
cylindrical shapes are made by turning; and so on.
The composite part for a given family (not to be confused with a part made of composite
material) is a hypothetical part that includes all of the design and manufacturing attributes of
the family. In general, an individual part in the family will have some of the features that
characterize the family, but not all of them. A production cell designed for the part family
would include those machines required to make the composite part. Such a cell would be
capable of producing any member of the family, simply by omitting those operations
corresponding to features not possessed by the particular part. The cell would also be designed
to allow for size variations within the family as well as feature variations.
To illustrate, consider the composite part in Figure 39.9(a). It represents a family of
rotational parts with features defined in part (b) of the figure. Associated with each feature
is a certain machining operation, as summarized in Table 39.4. A machine cell to produce

this part family would be designed with the capability to accomplish all of the operations in
the last column of the table.

Machine Cell Designs Machine cells can be classified according to number of machines
and level of automation. The possibilities are (a) single machine, (b) multiple machines with
manual handling, (c) multiple machines with mechanized handling, (d) flexible manufacturing cell, or (e) flexible manufacturing system. These production cells are depicted in
Figure 39.10.
The single machine cell has one machine that is manually operated. The cell would also
include fixtures and tools to allow for feature and size variations within the part family
produced by the cell. The machine cell required for the part family of Figure 39.9 would
probably be of this type.
Multiple machine cells have two or more manually operated machines. These cells are
distinguished by the method of workpart handling in the cell, manual or mechanized. Manual
handling means that parts are moved within the cell by workers, usually the machine
operators. Mechanized handling refers to conveyorized transfer of parts from one machine
to the next. This may be required by the size and weight of the parts made in the cell, or simply
to increase production rate. Our sketch depicts the work flow as being a line; other layouts are
also possible, such as U-shaped or loop.
Flexible manufacturing cells and flexible manufacturing systems consist of automated machines with automated handling. Given the special nature of these integrated
manufacturing systems and their importance, we devote Section 39.6 to their discussion.

Benefits and Problems in Group Technology The use of machine cells and group
technology provide substantial benefits to companies that have the discipline and perseverance to implement it. The potential benefits include the following: (1) GT promotes
standardization of tooling, fixturing, and setups; (2) material handling is reduced because
parts are moved within a machine cell rather than the entire factory; (3) production
scheduling is simplified; (4) manufacturing lead time is reduced; (5) work-in-process is
reduced; (6) process planning is simpler; (7) worker satisfaction usually improves working
in a cell; and (8) higher quality work is accomplished.
There are several problems in implementing machine cells, however. One obvious
problem isrearranging production machinesintheplantintothe appropriatemachinecells. It
takes time to plan and accomplish this rearrangement, and the machines are not producing
during the changeover. The biggest problem in starting a GT program is identifying the part
families. If the plant makes 10,000 different parts, reviewing all of the part drawings and
grouping the parts into families are substantial tasks that consume a significant amount
of time.

39.6

FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS AND CELLS
A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a highly automated GT machine cell, consisting of
a group of processing stations (usually computer numerical control [CNC] machine tools),
interconnected by an automated material handling and storage system, and controlled by an
integrated computer system. An FMS is capable of processing a variety of different part styles
simultaneously under NC program control at the different workstations.
An FMS relies on the principles of group technology. No manufacturing system can
be completely flexible. It cannot produce an infinite range of parts or products. There are
limits to how much flexibility can be incorporated into an FMS. Accordingly, a flexible
manufacturing system is designed to produce parts (or products) within a range of styles,
sizes, and processes. In other words, an FMS is capable of producing a single part family or a
limited range of part families.
Flexible manufacturing systems vary in terms of number of machine tools and level of
flexibility. When the system has only a few machines, the term flexible manufacturing cell
(FMC) is sometimes used. Both cell and system are highly automated and computer
controlled. The difference between an FMS and an FMC is not always clear, but it is
sometimes based on the number of machines (workstations) included. The flexible manufacturing system consists of four or more machines, while a flexible manufacturing cell
consists of three or fewer machines [10].
To qualify as being flexible, a manufacturing system should satisfy several criteria. The
tests of flexibility in an automated production system are the capability to (1) process
different part styles in a nonbatch mode, (2) accept changes in production schedule,
(3) respond gracefully to equipment malfunctions and breakdowns in the system, and
(4) accommodate the introduction of new part designs. These capabilities are made
possible by the use of a central computer that controls and coordinates the components of
the system. The most important criteria are (1) and (2); criteria (3) and (4) are softer and
can be implemented at various levels of sophistication.

39.6.1 INTEGRATING THE FMS COMPONENTS
An FMS consists of hardware and software that must be integrated into an efficient and
reliable unit. It also includes human personnel. In this section we examine these
components and how they are integrated.

Chapter 39/Integrated Manufacturing Systems

Hardware Components FMS hardware includes workstations, material handling
system, and central control computer. The workstations are CNC machines in a machining
type system, plus inspection stations, parts cleaning and other stations, as required. A
central chip conveyor system is often installed below floor level.
The material handling system is the means by which parts are moved between stations.
The material handling system usually includes a limited capability to store parts. Handling
systems suitable for automated manufacturing include roller conveyors, automated guided
vehicles,andindustrialrobots.Themostappropriatetypedependsonpartsizeandgeometry,as
well as factors relating to economics and compatibility with other FMS components. Nonrotational parts are often moved in a FMS on pallet fixtures, so the pallets are designed for
the particular handling system, and the fixtures are designed to accommodate the various
part geometries in the family. Rotational parts are often handled by robots, if weight is not a
limiting factor.
The handling system establishes the basic layout of the FMS. Five layout types can be
distinguished: (1) in-line, (2) loop, (3) ladder, (4) open field, and (5) robot-centered cell.
Types 1, 3, 4, and 5 are shown in Figure 39.11. Type 2 is shown in Figure 39.10(e). The inline layout uses a linear transfer system to move parts between processing stations and
load/unload station(s). The in-line transfer system is usually capable of two-directional
movement; if not, then the FMS operates much like a transfer line, and the different part
styles made on the system must follow the same basic processing sequence due to the onedirection flow. The loop layout consists of a conveyor loop with workstations located
around its periphery. This configuration permits any processing sequence, because any
station is accessible from any other station. This is also true for the ladder layout, in which
workstations are located on the rungs of the ladder. The open field layout is the most
complex FMS configuration, and consists of several loops tied together. Finally, the robotcentered cell consists of a robot whose work volume includes the load/unload positions of
the machines in the cell.
The FMS also includes a central computer that is interfaced to the other hardware
components. In addition to the central computer, the individual machines and other
components generally have microcomputers as their individual control units. The function
of the central computer is to coordinate the activities of the components so as to achieve a
smooth overall operation of the system. It accomplishes this function by means of software.
FMS Software and Control Functions FMS software consists of modules associated
with the various functions performed by the manufacturing system. For example, one
function involves downloading NC part programs to the individual machine tools; another
function is concerned with controlling the material handling system; another is concerned
with tool management; and so on. Table 39.5 lists the functions included in the operation of
a typical FMS. Associated with each function is one or more software modules. Terms other
than those in our table may be used in a given installation. The functions and modules are
largely application specific.
Human Labor An additional component in the operation of a flexible manufacturing
system or cell is human labor. Duties performed by human workers include (1) loading and
unloading parts from the system, (2) changing and setting cutting tools, (3) maintenance
and repair of equipment, (4) NC part programming, (5) programming and operating the
computer system, and (6) overall management of the system.

39.6.2 APPLICATIONS OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS
Flexible manufacturing systems are typically used for midvolume, midvariety production.
If the part or product is made in high quantities with no style variations, then a transfer line

or similar dedicated manufacturing system is most appropriate. If the parts are low volume
with high variety, then a stand-alone NC machine or even manual methods would be more
appropriate. These application characteristics are summarized in Figure 39.12.
Flexible machining systems comprise the most common application of FMS technology. Owing to the inherent flexibilities and capabilities of computer numerical control, it is
possible to connect several CNC machine tools to a small central computer, and to devise
automated material handling methods for transferring parts between machines. Figure 39.13
shows a flexible machining system consisting of five CNC machining centers and an in-line
transfer system to pick up parts from a central load/unload station and move them to the
appropriate machining stations.
In addition to machining systems, other types of flexible manufacturing systems have
also been developed, although the state of technology in these other processes has not

permitted the rapid implementation that has occurred in machining. The other types of
systems include assembly, inspection, sheet-metal processing (punching, shearing, bending,
and forming), and forging.
Most of the experience in flexible manufacturing systems has been gained in
machining applications. For flexible machining systems, the benefits usually given are
(1) higher machine utilization than a conventional machine shop—relative utilizations are
40% to 50% for conventional batch-type operations and about 75% for a FMS due to
better work handling, off-line setups, and improved scheduling; (2) reduced work-inprocess due to continuous production rather than batch production; (3) lower manufacturing lead times; and (4) greater flexibility in production scheduling.

39.7

COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
Distributed computer networks are widely used in modern manufacturing plants to monitor
and/or control the integrated systems described in this chapter. Even though some of the
operations are manually accomplished (e.g., manual assembly lines and manned cells),
computer systems are utilized for production scheduling, data collection, record keeping,
performance tracking, and other information-related functions. In the more automated
systems (e.g., transfer lines and flexible manufacturing cells), computers directly control the
operations. The term computer integrated manufacturing refers to the pervasive use of
computer systems throughout the organization, not only to monitor and control the
operations, but also to design the product, plan the manufacturing processes, and accomplish
the business functions related to production. One might say that CIM is the ultimate
integrated manufacturing system. In this final section of Part X, we outline the scope of CIM
and provide a bridge to Part XI on manufacturing support systems.

Chapter 39/Integrated Manufacturing Systems

To begin, let us identify four general functions that have to be accomplished in most
manufacturing enterprises: (1) product design, (2) manufacturing planning, (3) manufacturing control, and (4) business functions. Product design is usually an iterative process that
includes recognition of a need for a product, problem definition, creative synthesis of a
solution, analysis and optimization, evaluation, and documentation. The overall quality of the
resulting design is likely to be the most important factor upon which the commercial success
of a product depends. In addition, a very significant portion of the final cost of the product is
determined by decisions made during product design. Manufacturing planning is concerned
with converting the engineering drawings and specifications that define the product design
into a plan for producing the product. Manufacturing planning includes decisions on which
parts will be purchased (the ‘‘make-or-buy decision’’), how each ‘‘make’’ part will be
produced, the equipment that will be used, how the work will be scheduled, and so on.
Most of these decisions are discussed in Chapter 40 on manufacturing engineering and
Chapter 41 on production planning. Manufacturing control includes not only control of the
individual processes and equipment in the plant, but also the supporting functions such as
shop floor control and quality control, discussed in Chapters 41 and 42, respectively. Finally,
the business functions include order entry, cost accounting, payroll, customer billing, and
other business-oriented information activities related to manufacturing.
Computer systems play an important role in these four general functions, and their
integration within the organization is a distinguishing feature of computer integrated
manufacturing, as depicted in Figure 39.14. Computer systems associated with product design
are called CAD systems (for computer-aided design). Design systems and software include
geometric modeling, engineering analysis packages such as finite element modeling, design
review and evaluation, and automated drafting. Computer systems that support manufacturing planning are called CAM systems (for computer-aided manufacturing) and include
computer-aided process planning, NC part programming, production scheduling, and planning packages such as manufacturing resource planning (discussed in Chapter 41). Manufacturing control systems include those used in process control, shop floor control, inventory
control, and computer-aided inspection for quality control. And computerized business
systems are used for order entry, customer billing, and other business functions. Customer

orders are entered by the company’s sales force or by the customers themselves into the
computerized order entry system. The orders include product specifications that provide the
inputs to the design department. Based on these inputs, new products are designed on the
company’s CAD system. The design details serve as inputs to the manufacturing engineering
group, where computer-aided process planning, computer-aided tool design, and related
activities are performed in advance of actual production. The output from manufacturing
engineering provides much of the input data required for manufacturing resource planning
and production scheduling. Thus, computer integrated manufacturing provides the information flows required to accomplish the actual production of the product.
Today, computer integrated manufacturing is implemented in many companies using
enterprise resource planning (ERP), an extension of manufacturing resource planning that
organizesandintegratestheinformationflowsinacompanythroughasingle,centraldatabase.
The functions covered by ERP spread well beyond manufacturing operations; they include
sales, marketing, purchasing, logistics, distribution, inventory control, finance, and human
resources. ERP users within a company access and interact with the system using personal
computers at their own workplaces, whether they are located in offices or in the factory.

PROBLEMS
Manual Assembly Lines
39.1. A manual assembly line is being designed for a
product with annual demand ¼ 100,000 units. The
line will operate 50 wk/yr, 5 shifts/wk, and 7.5 hr/
shift. Work units will be attached to a continuously
moving conveyor. Work content time ¼ 42.0 min.
Assume line efficiency ¼ 0.97, balancing efficiency
¼ 0.92, and repositioning time ¼ 6 sec. Determine
(a) hourly production rate to meet demand,
(b) number of workers required, and (c) the number of workstations required if the estimated manning level is 1.4.
39.2. A manual assembly line produces a small appliance
whose work content time ¼ 25.9 min. Desired production rate ¼ 50 units/hr. Repositioning time ¼ 6
sec, line efficiency ¼ 95%, and balancing efficiency
is 93%. How many workers are on the line?
39.3. A single model manual assembly line produces a
product whose work content time ¼ 47.8 min. The
line has 24 workstations with a manning level ¼
1.25. Available shift time per day ¼ 8 hr, but
downtime during the shift reduces actual production time to 7.6 hr on average. This results in an
average daily production of 256 units/day. Repositioning time per worker is 8% of cycle time. Determine (a) line efficiency, (b) balancing efficiency,
and (c) repositioning time.
39.4. A final assembly plant for a certain automobile
model is to have a capacity of 240,000 units annually.
The plant will operate 50 wk/yr, 2 shifts/day, 5 days/
wk, and 8.0 hr/shift. It will be divided into three
departments: (1) body shop, (2) paint shop, (3) trimchassis-final department. The body shop welds the
car bodies using robots, and the paint shop coats the
bodies. Both of these departments are highly automated. Trim-chassis-final has no automation. There
are 15.5 hr of direct labor content on each car in this
department, where cars are moved by a continuous

conveyor. Determine (a) hourly production rate of
the plant, (b) number of workers and workstations
required in trim-chassis-final if no automated stations are used, the average manning level is 2.5,
balancing efficiency ¼ 93%, proportion uptime ¼
95%, and a repositioning time of 0.15 min is allowed
for each worker.
39.5. A product whose total work content time ¼ 50 min
is to be assembled on a manual production line.
The required production rate is 30 units/hr. From
previous experience with similar products, it is
estimated that the manning level will be close to
1.5. Assume that the uptime proportion and line
balancing efficiency are both ¼ 1.0. If 9 sec will be
lost from the cycle time for repositioning, determine (a) the cycle time and (b) the numbers of
workers and stations that will be needed on the
line.
39.6. A manual assembly line has 17 workstations with
one operator per station. Total work content time
to assemble the product ¼ 22.2 min. The production rate of the line ¼ 36 units/hr. A synchronous
transfer system is used to advance the products
from one station to the next, and the transfer
time ¼ 6 sec. The workers remain seated along
the line. Proportion uptime ¼ 0.90. Determine the
balance efficiency.
39.7. A production line with four automatic workstations (the other stations are manual) produces a
certain product whose total assembly work content
time ¼ 55.0 min of direct manual labor. The production rate on the line is 45 units/hr. Because of
the automated stations, uptime efficiency ¼ 89%.
The manual stations each have one worker. It is
known that 10% of the cycle time is lost due to
repositioning. If the balancing efficiency ¼ 0.92 on
the manual stations, find (a) cycle time, (b) number

E1C39

of workers and (c) workstations on the line.
(d) What is the average manning level on the
line, where the average includes the automatic
stations?
39.8. Production rate for a certain assembled product
is 47.5 units/hr. The total assembly work content
time ¼ 32 min of direct manual labor. The line
operates at 95% uptime. Ten workstations have
two workers on opposite sides of the line so that
both sides of the product can be worked on simultaneously. The remaining stations have one worker.
Repositioning time lost by each worker is 0.2 min/
cycle. It is known that the number of workers on the
line is two more than the number required for
perfect balance. Determine (a) number of workers,

(b) number of workstations, (c) the balancing efficiency, and (d) average manning level.
39.9. The total work content for a product assembled on
a manual production line is 48 min. The work is
transported using a continuous overhead conveyor
that operates at a speed of 3 ft/min. There are
24 workstations on the line, one-third of which
have two workers; the remaining stations each
have one worker. Repositioning time per worker
is 9 sec, and uptime efficiency of the line is 95%. (a)
What is the maximum possible hourly production
rate if line is assumed to be perfectly balanced? (b)
If the actual production rate is only 92% of the
maximum possible rate determined in part (a),
what is the balance efficiency on the line?

Automated Production Lines
39.10. An automated transfer line has 20 stations and
operates with an ideal cycle time of 1.50 min.
Probability of a station failure ¼ 0.008 and average
downtime when a breakdown occurs is 10.0 min.
Determine (a) the average production rate and
(b) the line efficiency.
39.11. A dial-indexing table has six stations. One station is
used for loading and unloading, which is accomplished by a human worker. The other five perform
processing operations. The longest process takes 25
sec and the indexing time ¼ 5 sec. Each station has
a frequency of failure ¼ 0.015. When a failure
occurs it takes an average of 3.0 min to make
repairs and restart. Determine (a) hourly production rate and (b) line efficiency.
39.12. A seven-station transfer line has been observed
over a 40-hour period. The process times at each
station are as follows: station 1, 0.80 min; station 2,
1.10 min; station 3, 1.15 min; station 4, 0.95 min;
station 5, 1.06 min; station 6, 0.92 min; and station
7, 0.80 min. The transfer time between stations ¼
6 sec. The number of downtime occurrences ¼ 110,
and hours of downtime ¼ 14.5 hr. Determine
(a) the number of parts produced during the
week, (b) the average actual production rate in
parts/hr, and (c) the line efficiency. (d) If the

balancing efficiency were computed for this line,
what would its value be?
39.13. A 12-station transfer line was designed to operate
with an ideal production rate ¼ 50 parts/hr. However, the line does not achieve this rate, since the
line efficiency ¼ 0.60. It costs $75/hr to operate the
line, exclusive of materials. The line operates 4000
hr/yr. A computer monitoring system has been
proposed that will cost $25,000 (installed) and
will reduce downtime on the line by 25%. If the
value added per unit produced ¼ $4.00, will the
computer system pay for itself within 1 year of
operation? Use expected increase in revenues resulting from the computer system as the criterion.
Ignore material costs in your calculations.
39.14. An automated transfer line is to be designed.
Based on previous experience, the average downtime per occurrence ¼ 5.0 min, and the probability
of a station failure that leads to a downtime occurrence p ¼ 0.01. The total work content time ¼
9.8 min and is to be divided evenly amongst the
workstations, so that the ideal cycle time for each
station ¼ 9.8/n. Determine (a) the optimum number of stations on the line n that will maximize
production rate, and (b) the production rate and
proportion uptime for your answer to part (a).

This final part of the book is concerned with manufacturing
support systems, which are the set of procedures and systems
used by a company to solve the technical and logistics problems encountered in planning the processes, ordering materials, controlling production, and ensuring that the company’s
products meet required quality specifications. The position of
the manufacturing support systems in the overall operations
of the company is portrayed in Figure 40.1. As with the
manufacturing systems in the factory, the manufacturing
support systems include people. People make the systems
work. Unlike the manufacturing systems in the factory, most
of the support systems do not directly contact the product
during its processing and assembly. Instead, they plan and
control the activities in the factory to ensure that the products
are completed and delivered to the customer on time, in the
right quantities, and to the highest quality standards.
The quality control system is one of the manufacturing
support systems, but it also consists of facilities located in the
factory—inspection equipment used to measure and gage the
materials being processed and products being assembled. We
coverthequalitycontrolsysteminChapter42onqualitycontrol
and inspection. Many of the traditional measurement and
gagingtechniques used in inspection aredescribed inChapter 5.

products. Its principal role is to engineer the transition of the product from design
specification to physical product. Its overall goal is to optimize production in a particular
organization. The scope of manufacturing engineering includes many activities and
responsibilities that depend on the type of production operations accomplished by the
organization. The usual activities include the following:
å Process planning. As our definition suggests, this is the principal activity of manufacturing engineering. Process planning includes (a) deciding what processes and
methods should be used and in what sequence, (b) determining tooling requirements,
(c) selecting production equipment and systems, and (d) estimating costs of production
for the selected processes, tooling, and equipment.
å Problem solving and continuous improvement. Manufacturing engineering provides
staff support to the operating departments (parts fabrication and product assembly) to
solve technical production problems. It should also be engaged in continuous efforts to
reduce production costs, increase productivity, and improve product quality.
å Design for manufacturability. In this function, which chronologically precedes the
other two, manufacturing engineers serve as manufacturability advisors to product
designers. The objective is to develop product designs that not only meet functional and
performance requirements, but that also can be produced at reasonable cost with
minimum technical problems at highest possible quality in the shortest possible time.
Manufacturing engineering must be performed in any industrial organization that is
engaged in production. The manufacturing engineering department usually reports to the
managerofmanufacturinginacompany.Insomecompaniesthedepartmentisknownbyother
names, such as process engineering or production engineering. Often included under manufacturing engineering are tool design, tool fabrication, and various technical support groups.

40.1 PROCESS PLANNING
Process planning involves determining the most appropriate manufacturing processes
and the order in which they should be performed to produce a given part or product
specified by design engineering. If it is an assembled product, process planning includes
deciding the appropriate sequence of assembly steps. The process plan must be developed within the limitations imposed by available processing equipment and productive
capacity of the factory. Parts or subassemblies that cannot be made internally must be

Equipment selection. In general, manufacturing engineers try to develop process plans that utilize existing equipment.
When this is not possible, the component in question must be purchased (Section 40.1.2), or new equipment must be
installed in the plant.
Tools, dies, molds, fixtures, and gages. The process planner must decide what tooling is needed for each process.
Actual design is usually delegated to the tool design department, and fabrication is accomplished by the tool room.
Cutting tools and cutting conditions for machining operations. These are specified by the process planner, industrial
engineer, shop foreman, or machine operator, often with reference to standard handbook recommendations.
Methods. Methods include hand and body motions, workplace layout, small tools, hoists for lifting heavy parts, and so
forth. Methods must be specified for manual operations (e.g., assembly) and manual portions of machine cycles (e.g.,
loading and unloading a production machine). Methods planning is traditionally done by industrial engineers.
Work standards. Work measurement techniques are used to establish time standards for each operation.
Estimating production costs. This is often accomplished by cost estimators with help from the process planner.

purchased from external suppliers. In some cases, items that can be produced internally
may be purchased from outside vendors for economic or other reasons.

40.1.1 TRADITIONAL PROCESS PLANNING
Traditionally, process planning has been accomplished by manufacturing engineers who are
knowledgeable in the particular processes used in the factory and are able to read engineering
drawings. Based on their knowledge, skill, and experience, they develop the processing steps
in the most logical sequence required to make each part. Table 40.1 lists the many details and
decisions usually included within the scope of process planning. Some of these details are
often delegated to specialists, such as tool designers; but manufacturing engineering is
responsible for them.

Process Planning for Parts The processes needed to manufacture a given part are
determined largely by the material out of which it is to be made. The material is selected by
the product designer based on functional requirements. Once the material has been
selected, the choice of possible processes is narrowed considerably. In our coverage of
engineering materials, we provided guides to the processing of the four material groups:
metals (Section 6.5), ceramics (Section 7.6), polymers (Section 8.5), and composite materials
(Section 9.5)
A typical processing sequence to fabricate a discrete part consists of (1) a basic process,
(2) one or more secondary processes, (3) operations to enhance physical properties, and
(4) finishing operations, illustrated in Figure 40.2. Basic and secondary processes are shaping
processes (Section 1.3.1) which alter the geometry of a workpart. A basic process establishes

Chapter 40/Manufacturing Engineering

the initial geometry of the part. Examples include metal casting, forging, and sheet-metal
rolling. In most cases, the starting geometry must be refined by a series of secondary processes.
These operations transform the basic shape into the final geometry. There is a correlation
between the secondary processes that might be used and the basic process that provides the
initial form. For example, when sand casting or forging are the basic processes, machining
operations are generally the secondary processes. When a rolling mill produces strips or coils
of sheet metal, the secondary processes are stamping operations such as blanking, punching,
and bending. Selection of certain basic processes minimizes the need for secondary processes.
For example, if plastic injection molding is the basic process, secondary operations are usually
not required because molding is capable of providing the detailed geometric features with
good dimensional accuracy.
Shaping operations are generally followed by operations to enhance physical properties and/or finish the product. Operations to enhance properties include heat treating
operations on metal components and glassware. In many cases, parts do not require these
property-enhancing steps in their processing sequence. This is indicated by the alternate
arrow path in our figure. Finishing operations are the final operations in the sequence; they
usually provide a coating on the workpart (or assembly) surface. Examples of these processes
are electroplating and painting.
In some cases, property-enhancing processes are followed by additional secondary
operations before proceeding to finishing, as suggested by the return loop in Figure 40.2. An
example is a machined part that is hardened by heat treatment. Prior to heat treatment, the
part is left slightly oversized to allow for distortion. After hardening, it is reduced to final
size and tolerance by finish grinding. Another example, again in metal parts fabrication, is
when annealing is used to restore ductility to the metal after cold working to permit further
deformation of the workpiece.
Table 40.2 presents some of the typical processing sequences for various materials and
basic processes. The task of the process planner usually begins after the basic process has
provided the initial shape of the part. Machined parts begin as bar stock or castings or
forgings, and the basic processes for these starting shapes are often external to the fabricating
plant. Stampings begin as sheet metal coils or strips purchased from the mill. These are the
raw materials supplied from external suppliers for the secondary processes and subsequent
operations to be performed in the factory. Determining the most appropriate processes and
the order in which they must be accomplished relies on the skill, experience, and judgment of
the process planner. Some of the basic guidelines and considerations used by process planners
to make these decisions are outlined in Table 40.3.

The Route Sheet The process plan is prepared on a form called a route sheet, a typical
example of which is shown in Figure 40.3 (some companies use other names for this form). It

Guidelines and considerations in deciding processes and their sequence in process planning.

Design requirements. The sequence of processes must satisfy the dimensions, tolerances, surface finish, and other
specifications established by product design.
Quality requirements. Processes must be selected that satisfy quality requirements in terms of tolerances, surface
integrity, consistency and repeatability, and other quality measures.
Production volume and rate. Is the product in the category of low, medium, or high production? The selection of
processes and systems is strongly influenced by volume and production rate.
Available processes. If the product and its components are to be made in-house, the process planner must select
processes and equipment already available in the factory.
Material utilization. It is desirable for the process sequence to make efficient use of materials and minimize waste.
When possible, net shape or near net shape processes should be selected.
Precedence constraints. These are technological sequencing requirements that determine or restrict the order in which
the processing steps can be performed. A hole must be drilled before it can be tapped; a powder-metal part must be
pressed before sintering; a surface must be cleaned before painting; and so on.
Reference surfaces. Certain surfaces of the part must be formed (usually by machining) near the beginning of the
sequence so they can serve as locating surfaces for other dimensions that are formed subsequently. For example, if a
hole is to be drilled a certain distance from the edge of a given part, that edge must first be machined.
Minimize setups. The number of separate machine setups should be minimized. Wherever possible, operations should
be combined at the same workstation. This saves time and reduces material handling.
Eliminate unnecessary steps. The process sequence should be planned with the minimum number of processing steps.
Unnecessary operations should be avoided. Design changes should be requested to eliminate features not absolutely
needed, thereby eliminating the processing steps associated with those features.
Flexibility. Where feasible, the process should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate engineering design changes.
This is often a problem when special tooling must be designed to produce the part; if the part design is changed, the
special tooling may be rendered obsolete.
Safety. Worker safety must be considered in process selection. This makes good economic sense, and it is the law
(Occupational Safety and Health Act).
Minimum cost. The process sequence should be the production method that satisfies all of the above requirements and
also achieves the lowest possible product cost.

is called a route sheet because it specifies the sequence of operations and equipment that
will be visited by the part during its production. The route sheet is to the process planner
what the engineering drawing is to the product designer. It is the official document that
specifies the details of the process plan. The route sheet should include all manufacturing
operations to be performed on the workpart, listed in the proper order in which they are to
be accomplished. For each operation, the following should be listed: (1) a brief description
of the operation indicating the work to be done, surfaces to be processed with references to
the part drawing, and dimensions (and tolerances, if not specified on part drawing) to
be achieved; (2) the equipment on which the work is to be performed; and (3) any
special tooling required, such as dies, molds, cutting tools, jigs or fixtures, and gages. In
addition, some companies include cycle time standards, setup times, and other data on
the route sheet.
Sometimes a more detailed operation sheet is also prepared for each operation listed in
the routing. This is retained in the particular department where the operation is performed. It
indicates the specific details of the operation, such as cutting speeds, feeds, and tools, and other
instructions useful to the machine operator. Setup sketches are sometimes also included.

Process Planning for Assemblies For low production, assembly is generally done at
individual workstations and a worker or team of workers performs the assembly work
elements to complete the product. In medium and high production, assembly is usually
performed on production lines (Section 39.4). In either case, there is a precedence order in
which the work must be accomplished.
Process planning for assembly involves preparation of the assembly instructions that
must be performed. For single stations, the documentation is similar to the processing route
sheet in Figure 40.3. It contains a list of the assembly steps in the order in which they must be
accomplished. For assembly line production, process planning consists of allocating work
elements to particular stations along the line, a procedure called line balancing (Section
39.3.2). In effect, the assembly line routes the work units to individual stations, and the line
balancing solution determines what assembly steps must be performed at each station. As
with process planning for parts, any tools and fixtures needed to accomplish a given
assembly work element must be decided, and the workplace layout must be designed.

40.1.2 MAKE OR BUY DECISION
Inevitably, the question arises as to whether a given part should be purchased from an
outside vendor or made internally. First of all, it should be recognized that virtually all
manufacturers purchase their starting materials from suppliers. A machine shop buys bar
stock from a metals distributor and castings from a foundry. A plastic molder obtains
molding compound from a chemical company. A pressworking company purchases sheet
metal from a rolling mill. Very few companies are vertically integrated all the way from raw
materials to finished product.
Given that a company purchases at least some of its starting materials, it is reasonable
to ask whether the company should purchase at least some of the parts that would otherwise
be made in its own factory. The answer to the question is the make or buy decision. The make
versus buy question is probably appropriate to ask for every component used by the
company.
Cost is the most important factor in deciding whether a part should be made in-house
or purchased. If the vendor is significantly more proficient in the processes required to
make the component, it is likely that the internal production cost will be greater than the
purchase price even when a profit is included for the vendor. On the other hand, if
purchasing the part results in idle equipment in the factory, then an apparent cost advantage
for the vendor may be a disadvantage for the home factory. Consider the following example.

E1C40

18:13:41

Page 951

Section 40.1/Process Planning

Example 40.1
Make or Buy Cost
Comparison

951

Suppose that the quoted price for a certain component from a vendor is $8.00 per unit for
1000 units. The same part made in the home factory would cost $9.00. The cost breakdown on the make alternative is as follows:
Unit material cost ¼ $2:25 per unit
Direct labor ¼ $2:00 per unit
Labor overhead at 150% ¼ $3:00 per unit
Equipment fixed cost ¼ $1:75 per unit
Total ¼ $9:00 per unit
Should the component by bought or made in-house?
Solution: Although the vendor’s quote seems to favor the buy decision, let us consider
the possible effect on the factory if we decide to accept the quote. The equipment fixed
cost is an allocated cost based on an investment that has already been made. If it turns out
that the equipment is rendered idle by the decision to buy the part, then one might argue
that the fixed cost of $1.75 continues even if the equipment is not in use. Similarly, the
overhead cost of $3.00 consists of factory floor space, indirect labor, and other costs that
will also continue even if the part is bought. By this reasoning, the decision to purchase
might cost the company as much as $8.00 þ $1.75 þ $3.00 ¼ $12.75 per unit if it results in
idle time in the factory on the machine that would have been used to make the part.
On the other hand, if the equipment can be used to produce other components for
which the internal prices are less than the corresponding external quotes, then a buy
decision makes good economic sense.
n
Make or buy decisions are rarely as clear as in Example 40.1. Some of the other
factors that enter the decision are listed in Table 40.4. Although these factors appear to
be subjective, they all have cost implications, either directly or indirectly. In recent
years, major companies have placed strong emphasis on building close relationships
with parts suppliers. This trend has been especially prevalent in the automobile
industry, where long-term agreements have been reached between each carmaker
and a limited number of vendors who are able to deliver high-quality components
reliably on schedule.

TABLE 40.4

Key factors in the make or buy decision.

Factor

Explanation and Effect on Make/Buy Decision

Process available inhouse

If a given process is not available internally, then the obvious decision is to purchase.
Vendors often develop proficiency in a limited set of processes that makes them cost
competitive in external-internal comparisons. There are exceptions to this guideline, in
which a company decides that, in its long-term strategy, it must develop a proficiency in a
manufacturing process technology that it does not currently possess.
Number of units required. High volume tends to favor make decisions. Low quantities tend
to favor buy decisions.
Long product life favors internal production.
Standard catalog items, such as bolts, screws, nuts, and many other types of components are
produced economically by suppliers specializing in those products. It is almost always
better to purchase these standard items.
The reliable supplier gets the business.
In some cases, factories buy parts from vendors as an alternative source to their own
production plants. This is an attempt to ensure uninterrupted supply of parts, or to smooth
production in peak demand periods.

40.1.3 COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS PLANNING
During the last several decades, there has been considerable interest in computer-aided
process planning (CAPP)—automating the process planning function by means of computer
systems. Shop people knowledgeable in manufacturing processes are gradually retiring. An
alternative approach to process planning is needed, and CAPP systems provide this
alternative. Computer-aided process planning systems are designed around either of two
approaches: retrieval systems and generative systems.

Retrieval CAPP Systems Retrieval CAPP systems, also known as variant CAPP
systems, are based on group technology and parts classification and coding (Section 39.5).
In these systems, a standard process plan is stored in computer files for each part code
number. The standard plans are based on current part routings in use in the factory, or on an
ideal plan that is prepared for each family. Retrieval CAPP systems operate as indicated in
Figure 40.4. The user begins by identifying the GT code of the part for which the process
plan is to be determined. A search is made of the part family file to determine if a standard
route sheet exists for the given part code. If the file contains a process plan for the part, it is
retrieved and displayed for the user. The standard process plan is examined to determine
whether modifications are necessary. Although the new part has the same code number,
minor differences in the processes might be required to make the part. The standard plan is
edited accordingly. The capacity to alter an existing process plan is why retrieval CAPP
systems are also called variant systems.
If the file does not contain a standard process plan for the given code number, the user
may search the file for a similar code number for which a standard routing exists. By editing
the existing process plan, or by starting from scratch, the user develops the process plan for
the new part. This becomes the standard process plan for the new part code number.
The final step is the process plan formatter, which prints the route sheet in the proper
format. The formatter may call other application programs: determining cutting conditions for
machine tool operations, calculating standard times for machining operations, or computing
cost estimates.
Generative CAPP Systems Generative CAPP systems are an alternative to retrieval
systems. Rather than retrieving and editing existing plans from a database, a generative
system creates the process plan using systematic procedures that might be applied by a
human planner. In a fully generative CAPP system, the process sequence is planned
without human assistance and without predefined standard plans.
Designing a generative CAPP system is a problem in the field of expert systems, a
branch of artificial intelligence. Expert systems are computer programs capable of solving
complex problems that normally require a human who has years of education and experience.

Process planning fits that definition. Several ingredients are required in a fully generative
CAPP system:
1. Knowledge base. The technical knowledge of manufacturing and the logic used by
successful process planners must be captured and coded into a computer program. An
expert system applied to process planning requires the knowledge and logic of human
process planners to be incorporated into a knowledge base. Generative CAPP systems then
use the knowledge base to solve process planning problems; that is, to create route sheets.
2. Computer-compatible part description. Generative process planning requires a computer-compatible description of the part. The description contains all the pertinent data
needed to plan the process sequence. Two possible descriptions are (1) the geometric
model of the part developed on a CAD system during product design, or (2) a group
technology code number of the part defining its features in significant detail.
3. Inference engine. A generativeCAPP system requires the capabilityto applythe planning
logic and process knowledge contained in the knowledge base to a given part description.
The CAPP system applies its knowledge base to solve a specific problem of planning the
processforanewpart.Thisproblem-solvingprocedureisreferredtoastheinferenceengine
in the terminology of expert systems. By using its knowledge base and inference engine, the
CAPP system synthesizes a new process plan for each new part presented to it.

Benefits of CAPP Benefits of computer-automated process planning include the following: (1) process rationalization and standardization—automated process planning leads to
more logical and consistent process plans than when traditional process planning is used; (2)
increased productivity of process planners—the systematic approach and availability of
standard process plans in the data files permit a greater number of process plans to be
developed by the user; (3) reduced lead time to prepare process plans; (4) improved legibility
compared to manually prepared route sheets; and (5) ability to interface CAPP programs
with other application programs, such as cost estimating, work standards, and others.

40.2

PROBLEM SOLVING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Problems arise in manufacturing that require technical staff support beyond what is normally
available in the line organization of the production departments. Providing this technical
support is one of the responsibilities of manufacturing engineering. The problems are usually
specific to the particular technologies of the processes performed in the operating department. In machining, the problems may relate to selection of cutting tools, fixtures that do not
work properly, parts with out-of-tolerance conditions, or non-optimal cutting conditions. In
plastic molding, the problems may be excessive flash, parts sticking in the mold, or any of
several defects that can occur in a molded part. These problems are technical, and engineering expertise is often required to solve them.
In some cases, the solution may require a design change; for example, changing the
tolerance on a part dimension to eliminate a finish grinding operation while still achieving the
functionality of the part. The manufacturing engineer is responsible for developing the proper
solution to the problem and proposing the engineering change to the design department.
One of the areas that is ripe for improvement is setup time. The procedures involved
in changing over from one production setup to the next (i.e., in batch production) are time
consuming and costly. Manufacturing engineers are responsible for analyzing changeover
procedures and finding ways to reduce the time required to perform them. Some of the
approaches used in setup reduction are described in Section 41.4.
In addition to solving current technical problems (‘‘fire fighting,’’ as it might be called),
the manufacturing engineering department is also responsible for continuous improvement

E1C40

Chapter 40/Manufacturing Engineering

projects. Continuous improvement means constantly searching for and implementing ways to
reduce cost, improve quality, and increase productivity in manufacturing. It is accomplished
one project at a time. Depending on the type of problem area, it may involve a project team
whose membership includes not only manufacturing engineers, but also other personnel such
as product designers, quality engineers, and production workers.

40.3 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING AND DESIGN FOR
MANUFACTURABILITY
Much of the process planning function described in Section 40.1 is preempted by decisions
made in product design. Decisions on material, part geometry, tolerances, surface finish,
grouping of parts into subassemblies, and assembly techniques limit the available manufacturing processes that can be used to make a given part. If the product engineer designs an
aluminum sand casting with features that can be achieved only by machining (e.g., flat
surfaces with good finishes, close tolerances, and threaded holes), then the process planner
has no choice but to plan for sand casting followed by the required machining operations. If
the product designer specifies a collection of sheet-metal stampings to be assembled by
threaded fasteners, then the process planner must lay out the series of blanking, punching, and
forming steps to fabricate the stampings and then assemble them. In both of these examples, a
plastic molded part may be a superior design, both functionally and economically. It is
important for the manufacturing engineer to act as an advisor to the design engineer in
matters of manufacturability because manufacturability matters, not only to the production
departments but to the design engineer. A product design that is functionally superior and at
the same time can be produced at minimum cost holds the greatest promise of success in the
marketplace. Successful careers in design engineering are built on successful products.
Terms often associated with this attempt to favorably influence the manufacturability
of a product are design for manufacturing (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA). Of course,
DFM and DFA are inextricably coupled, so let us refer to them as DFM/A. The scope of
DFM/A is expanded in some companies to include not only manufacturability issues but also
marketability, testability, serviceability, maintainability, and so forth. This broader view calls
for inputs from many departments in addition to design and manufacturing engineering. The
approach is called concurrent engineering. Our discussion is organized into two sections:
DFM/A and concurrent engineering.

40.3.1 DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY
Design for manufacturing and assembly is an approach to product design that systematically includes considerations of manufacturability and assemblability in the design.
DFM/A includes organizational changes and design principles and guidelines.
To implement DFM/A, a company must change its organizational structure, either
formally or informally, to provide closer interaction and better communication between
design and manufacturing personnel. This is often accomplished by forming project teams
consisting of product designers, manufacturing engineers, and other specialties (e.g., quality
engineers, material scientists) to design the product. In some companies, design engineers are
required to spend some career time in manufacturing to learn about the problems encountered in making things. Another possibility is to assign manufacturing engineers to the
product design department as full-time consultants.
DFM/A also includes principles and guidelines that indicate how to design a given
product for maximum manufacturability. Many of these are universal design guidelines,
such as those presented in Table 40.5. They are rules of thumb that can be applied to nearly

Section 40.3/Concurrent Engineering and Design for Manufacturability
TABLE 40.5

955

General principles and guidelines in design for manufacturing and assembly.

Minimize number of components. Assembly costs are reduced. The final product is more reliable because there are
fewer connections. Disassembly for maintenance and field service is easier. Reduced part count usually means
automation is easier to implement. Work-in-process is reduced, and there are fewer inventory control problems.
Fewer parts need to be purchased, which reduces ordering costs.
Use standard commercially available components. Design time and effort are reduced. Design of custom-engineered
components is avoided. There are fewer part numbers. Inventory control is facilitated. Quantity discounts may be
possible.
Use common parts across product lines. There is an opportunity to apply group technology (Section 39.5).
Implementation of manufacturing cells may be possible. Quantity discounts may be possible.
Design for ease of part fabrication. Net shape and near net shape processes may be feasible. Part geometry is
simplified, and unnecessary features are avoided. Unnecessary surface finish requirements should be avoided;
otherwise, additional processing may be needed.
Design parts with tolerances that are within process capability. Tolerances tighter than the process capability
(Section 42.2) should be avoided; otherwise, additional processing or sortation will be required. Bilateral tolerances
should be specified.
Design the product to be foolproof during assembly. Assembly should be unambiguous. Components should be
designed so they can be assembled only one way. Special geometric features must sometimes be added to
components to achieve foolproof assembly.
Minimize use of flexible components. Flexible components include parts made of rubber, belts, gaskets, cables, etc.
Flexible components are generally more difficult to handle and assemble.
Design for ease of assembly. Part features such as chamfers and tapers should be designed on mating parts. Design the
assembly using base parts to which other components are added. The assembly should be designed so that
components are added from one direction, usually vertically. Threaded fasteners (screws, bolts, nuts) should be
avoided where possible, especially when automated assembly is used; instead, fast assembly techniques such as snap
fits and adhesive bonding should be employed. The number of distinct fasteners should be minimized.
Use modular design. Each subassembly should consist of five to fifteen parts. Maintenance and repair are facilitated.
Automated and manual assembly are implemented more readily. Inventory requirements are reduced. Final
assembly time is minimized.
Shape parts and products for ease of packaging. The product should be designed so that standard packaging cartons
can be used, which are compatible with automated packaging equipment. Shipment to customer is facilitated.
Eliminate or reduce adjustment required. Adjustments are time-consuming in assembly. Designing adjustments into
the product means more opportunities for out-of-adjustment conditions to arise.

any product design situation. In addition, several of our chapters on manufacturing
processes include DFM/A principles that are specific to those processes.
The guidelines are sometimes in conflict. For example, one guideline for part design is
to make the geometry as simple as possible. Yet, in design for assembly, it is often desirable to
combine features of several assembled parts into a single component to reduce part count and
assembly time. In these instances, design for manufacture conflicts with design for assembly,
and a compromise must be found that achieves the best balance between opposing sides of
the conflict.
Benefits typically cited for DFM/A include (1) shorter time to bring the product to
market, (2) smoother transition into production, (3) fewer components in the final

product, (4) easier assembly, (5) lower costs of production, (6) higher product quality, and
(7) greater customer satisfaction [1], [2].

40.3.2 CONCURRENT ENGINEERING
Concurrentengineeringrefers toan approachto product design in whichcompanies attempt to
reduce the elapsed time required to bring a new product to market by integrating design
engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other functions in the company. The traditional
approach to launch a new product tends to separate the two functions, as illustrated in
Figure 40.5(a). Product design develops the new design, sometimes with small regard for the
manufacturing capabilities possessed by the company. There is little interaction between
design engineers and manufacturing engineers who might provide advice on these capabilities
and how the product design might be altered to accommodate them. It is as if a wall exists
between the two functions; when design engineering completes the design, it tosses the
drawings and specifications over the wall so that process planning can commence.
In a company that practices concurrent engineering (also known as simultaneous
engineering), manufacturing planning begins while the product design is being developed, as
pictured in Figure 40.5(b). Manufacturing engineering becomes involved early in the product
development cycle. In addition, other functions are also involved, such as field service, quality
engineering, the manufacturing departments, vendors supplying critical components, and in
some cases customers who will use the product. All of these functions can contribute to a
product design that not only performs well functionally, but is also manufacturable,
assemblable, inspectable, testable, serviceable, maintainable, free of defects, and safe. All
viewpoints have been combined to design a product of high quality that will deliver customer
satisfaction. And through early involvement, rather than a procedure of reviewing the final
design and suggesting changes after it is too late to conveniently make them, the total product
development cycle is substantially reduced.

Review Questions

957

In addition to design for manufacturing and assembly, other objectives include
design for quality, design for life cycle, and design for cost.
With the importance of quality in international competition, and the demonstrated
success of those companies that have been able to produce products of high quality, one must
conclude that design for quality is very important. Chapter 42 is devoted to the topic of quality
control and includes a discussion of several quality approaches related to product design.
Design for life cycle refers to the product after it has been manufactured. In
many cases, a product can involve a significant cost to the customer beyond the
purchase price. These costs include installation, maintenance and repair, spare parts,
future upgrading of the product, safety during operation, and disposition of the product
at the end of its useful life. The price paid for the product may be a small portion of its
total cost when life cycle costs are included. Some customers (e.g., federal government)
consider life cycle costs in their purchasing decisions. The manufacturer must often
include service contracts that limit customer vulnerability to excessive maintenance
and service costs. In these cases, accurate estimates of these life cycle costs must be
included in the total product cost.
A product’s cost is a major factor in determining its commercial success. Cost affects
the price charged for the product and the profit made on it. Design for product cost refers to
the efforts of a company to identify the impact of design decisions on overall product costs
and to control those costs through optimal design. Many of the DFM/A guidelines are
directed at reducing product cost.

Production planning and control are the manufacturing support systems concerned with logistics problems in the production function. Production planning is concerned with planning
what products are to be produced, in what quantities, and
when. It also considers the resources required to accomplish
the plan. Production control determines whether the resources to execute the plan have been provided and, if not,
takes the necessary action to correct the deficiency. The scope
of production planning and control includes inventory control,
which is concerned with having appropriate stock levels available of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods.
Problems in production planning and control differ for
different types of manufacturing. One of the important factors
is the relationship between product variety and production
quantity (Section 1.1.2). At one extreme is job shop production, in which a number of different product types are each
produced in low quantities. The products are often complex,
consisting of many components, each of which must be
processed through multiple operations. Solving the logistics
problems in such a plant requires detailed planning—scheduling and coordinating the large numbers of different components and processing steps for the different products.
At the other extreme is mass production, in which a
single product (with perhaps some limited model variations) is
produced in very large quantities (millions of units). The
logistics problems in mass production are simple if the product
and process are simple. In more complex cases, the product is
an assembly consisting of many components (e.g., automobiles and household appliances) and the facility is organized as
a production line (Section 39.2). The logistics problem in
operating such a plant is to get each component to the right
workstation at the right time so that it can be assembled to the
product as it passes through that station. Failure to solve this
problem can result in stoppage of the entire production line
for lack of a critical part.
To distinguish between these two extremes in terms of
the issues in production planning and control, we can say that
the planning function is emphasized in a job shop, whereas the

control function is emphasized in the mass production of assembled products. There are many
variations between these extremes, with accompanying differences in the way production
planning and control are implemented.
Figure 41.1 presents a block diagram depicting the activities of a modern production
planning and control system and their interrelationships. The activities can be divided into
three phases: (1) aggregate production planning, (2) detailed planning of material and
capacity requirements, and (3) purchasing and shop floor control. Our discussion of
production planning and control in this chapter is organized around this framework.

41.1 AGGREGATE PLANNING AND THE MASTER PRODUCTION
SCHEDULE
Any manufacturing firm must have a business plan, and the plan must include what products
will be produced, how many, and when. The manufacturing plan should take into account
current orders and sales forecasts, inventory levels, and plant capacity considerations. There
are several types of manufacturing plans in terms of planning horizon: (1) long-range plans

that deal with a time horizon that is more than one year in the future; (2) medium-range
plans that are concerned with the period 6 months to 1 year in the future; and (3) shortrange plans that consider near future horizons such as days or weeks.
Long-range planning is the responsibility of the highest level executives of the
company. It is concerned with corporate goals and strategies, future product lines, financial
planning for the future, and obtaining the resources (personnel, facilities, and equipment)
necessary so that the company will have a future. As the planning horizon is reduced, the
company’s long-range plan must be translated into medium-range and short-range plans that
become increasingly specific. At the medium-range level are the aggregate production plan
and the master production schedule, examined in this section. In the short range are material
and capacity requirements planning, and detailed scheduling of the orders.
The aggregate production plan indicates production output levels for major product
lines rather than specific products. It must be coordinated with the sales and marketing plan of
the company and must consider current inventory levels. Aggregate planning is therefore a
high-level corporate planning activity, although details of the planning process are delegated
to staff. The aggregate plan must reconcile the marketing plans for current products and new
products under development against the capacity resources available to make those products.
The planned output levels of the major product lines listed in the aggregate
schedule must be converted into a very specific schedule of individual products. This
is called the master production schedule, and it lists the products to be manufactured,
when they should be completed, and in what quantities. A hypothetical master schedule
is presented in Table 41.1(b) for a limited product set, with the corresponding aggregate
plan for the product line in Table 41.1(a).
Products listed in the master schedule generally are divided into three categories: (1)
firm customer orders, (2) forecasted demand, and (3) spare parts. Customer orders for
specific products usually obligate the company to a delivery date that has been promised to a
customer by the sales department. The second category consists of production output levels
based on forecasted demand, in which statistical forecasting techniques are applied to
previous demand patterns, estimates by the sales staff, and other sources. The forecast often
dominates the master schedule. The third category is demand for individual component
parts—repair parts to be stocked in the firm’s service department. Some companies exclude
this third category from the master schedule because it does not represent end products.

Chapter 41/Production Planning and Control

The master production schedule is a medium-range plan because it must consider the
lead times required to order raw materials and components, fabricate parts in the factory, and
then assemble and test the final products. Depending on type of product, these lead times can
run from several months to more than a year. However, although it deals with the midterm
horizon, it is a dynamic plan. It is usually considered to be fixed in the near term, meaning that
changes are disallowed within about a 6-week horizon. However, adjustments in the schedule
are possible beyond six weeks to deal with shifts in demand or new product opportunities. It
should therefore be noted that the aggregate production plan is not the only input to the
master schedule. Other drivers that may cause it to deviate from the aggregate plan include
new customer orders and changes in sales forecast over the near term.

41.2 INVENTORY CONTROL
Inventory control is concerned with achieving a balance between two competing objectives:
(1) minimizing the cost of maintaining inventory and (2) maximizing service to customers.
Inventory costs include investment costs, storage costs, and cost of possible obsolescence
or spoilage. Investment cost is often the dominant factor; a typical case is when the
company invests borrowed money at a certain interest rate in materials that have not yet
been delivered to the customer. All of these costs are referred to as carrying costs. The
company can minimize carrying cost by maintaining zero inventories. However, customer
service is likely to suffer, and customers may decide to take their business elsewhere. This
has a cost, referred to as stock-out cost. A reasonable company wants to minimize stockout cost and provide a high level of customer service. Customers are of two kinds: (1)
external customers, the kind we usually associate with the word, and (2) internal
customers, which are the operating departments, final assembly, and other units in the
company that depend on the ready availability of materials and parts.

41.2.1 TYPES OF INVENTORY
Various types of inventory are encountered in manufacturing. The categories of greatest
interest in production planning and control are raw materials, purchased components, inprocess inventory (work-in-process), and finished products.
Different inventory control procedures are appropriate, depending on which type
we are attempting to manage. An important distinction is between items subject to
independent versus dependent demand. Independent demand means that the demand or
consumption of the item is unrelated to demand for other items. End products and spare
parts experience independent demand. Customers purchase end products and spare
parts, and their decisions to do so are unrelated to the purchase of other items.
Dependent demand refers to the fact that demand for the item is directly related to
demand for something else, usually because the item is a component of an end product subject
to independent demand. Consider an automobile—an end product, the demand for which is
independent. Each car has four tires (five, if we include the spare), whose demand depends on
the demand for the automobile. Thus, the tires used on new automobiles are examples of
dependent demand. For every car made in the final assembly plant, four tires must be ordered.
The same is true of the thousands of other components used on an automobile. Once the
decision is made to produce a car, all of these components must be supplied to build it.
Tires represent an interesting example because they not only experience dependent
demand in the new car business, but also independent demand in the replacement tire market.
Different production and inventory control procedures must be used for independent
and dependent demand. Forecasting procedures are commonly used to determine future

E1C41

Section 41.2/Inventory Control

963

production levels of independent demand products. Production of the components used on
these products is then determined directly from the product quantities to be made. Two
different inventory control systems are required for the two cases: (1) order point systems
and (2) material requirements planning. Order point systems are covered in the following
section. Material requirements planning is covered in Section 41.3.1.

41.2.2 ORDER POINT SYSTEMS
Order point systems address two related problems encountered when controlling inventories of independent demand items: how much to order and when to order. The first problem
can be solved using economic order quantity formulas. The second problem can be solved
using reorder points.

Economic Order Quantity The problem of determining the appropriate quantity that
should be ordered or produced arises in cases of independent demand products, in which
demand for the item is relatively constant during the period under consideration and the
production rate is significantly greater than demand rate. This is the typical make-to-stock
situation. A similar problem is encountered in some dependent demand situations, when
usage of the components in the final product is fairly steady over time and it makes sense to
pay some inventory carrying costs in order to reduce the frequency of setups. In both of these
situations, the inventory level is gradually depleted over time and then quickly replenished to
some maximum level determined by the order quantity, as depicted in Figure 41.2.
One can derive a total cost equation for the sum of carrying cost and setup cost for
the inventory model in Figure 41.2. The model has a sawtooth appearance, representing
the gradual consumption of product down to a zero, followed by immediate replenishment up to a maximum level Q. Based on this behavior, the average inventory level is
one-half the maximum level Q. The total annual inventory cost equation is
TIC ¼

Ch Q Csu Da
þ
Q

ð41:1Þ

where TIC ¼ total annual inventory cost (carrying plus ordering costs), $/yr; Q ¼ order
quantity, pc/order; Ch ¼ holding cost (cost of carrying the inventory), $/pc/yr; Csu ¼ cost of
setting up for an order, $/setup or $/order; and Da ¼ annual demand for the item, pc/yr. In
the equation, the ratio Da Q ¼ the number of orders (batches of parts produced) per year; it
therefore gives the number of setups per year.
The carrying cost Ch is generally taken to be directly proportional to the value of
the item; that is,
Ch ¼ hCp

ð41:2Þ

where Cp ¼ cost per piece, $/unit; and h ¼ annual holding cost rate, which includes
interest and storage charges, (yr)1.

The setup cost Csu includes the cost of idle production equipment during the
changeover time between batches, as well as whatever labor costs are involved in the
setup changes. Thus,
Csu ¼ T su Cdt

ð41:3Þ

where Tsu ¼ setup or changeover time between batches, hr; and Cdt ¼ cost rate of machine
downtime, $/hr. In cases where parts are ordered from an outside vendor, the price quoted
by the vendor usually includes a setup cost, either directly or in the form of quantity
discounts. Csu should also include the internal costs of placing the order to the vendor.
It should be noted that Eq. (41.1) excludes the actual annual cost of part production, which is DaCp. If this cost is included, then annual total cost is given by
TC ¼ Da Cp þ

By taking the derivative of either Eq. (41.1) or Eq. (41.4) and setting it to zero, we

setup costs:

A product is made to stock. Annual demand rate is 12,000 units. One unit of product costs
$10 and the holding cost rate ¼ 24%/yr. Setting up to produce a batch of products requires
changeover of equipment, which takes 4 hr. The cost of equipment downtime plus labor ¼
$100/hr. Determine the economic order quantity and the total inventory costs for this case.
Solution: Setup cost Csu ¼ 4  $100 ¼ $400. Holding cost per unit ¼ 0.24  $10 ¼ $2.40.
Using these values and the annual demand rate in the EOQ formula, we have

Including the actual production costs in the annual total, by Eq. (41.4) we have

The EOQ formula has been a widely used model for deciding ‘‘optimum production runs.’’ There are variations of Eqs. (41.1) and (41.4) that take into account additional
factors such as rate of production. While the mathematical accuracy of the formula
cannot be disputed, it is instructive to note some of the difficulties encountered in its
application. One difficulty is concerned with the values of the parameters in the equation,
namely setup or ordering cost and inventory carrying costs. These costs are often difficult
to evaluate; yet they have an important effect on the calculated EOQ value.
A second difficulty is concerned with an erroneous tenet of manufacturing philosophy
that has been promulgated by the use of the EOQ formula in the United States. It is that long
production runs represent an optimum strategy in batch manufacturing. No matter how much
it costs to change the setup, the formula gives the optimum production batch size. The higher

the setup cost, the longer the production run. A preferable approach is to develop ways to
reduce the setup cost by reducing the time required to accomplish a changeover. Setup
reduction is an important component of just-in-time production, and we consider some of the
ways to reduce setup time in Section 41.4.

When to Reorder Determining when to reorder can be accomplished in several ways.
Here we describe the reorder point system that is widely used in industry. Refer to Figure 41.3,
which provides a more realistic view of the likely variations in demand rate than Figure 41.2. In
a reorder point system, when the inventory level for a given stock item declines to some point
defined as the reorder point, this is the signal to place an order to restock the item. The reorder
point is set at a high enough level so as to minimize the probability that a stock-out will occur
during the period between when the reorder point is reached and a new batch is received.
Reorder point policies can be implemented using computerized inventory control
systems. These systems are programmed to continuously monitor the inventory level as
transactions are made, and to automatically generate an order for a new batch when the level
falls below the reorder point. A noncomputerized system, called the two-bin approach, starts
with two equally sized bins both filled with parts of a certain type, but parts are only
withdrawn from one of the bins to satisfy demand. When the supply in that bin has been
exhausted, an order is placed to replenish it, and the other bin is used to satisfy demand.
Switching back and forth between bins in this way provides a very simple method of inventory
control. In effect, the reorder point is signaled when one of the bins becomes empty.

41.3

MATERIAL AND CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
We present two alternative techniques for planning and controlling production and inventory.
In this section we cover procedures used for job shop and midrange production of assembled
products. In Section 41.4, we examine procedures more appropriate for high production.

41.3.1 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
Material requirements planning (MRP) is a computational procedure used to convert the
master production schedule for end products into a detailed schedule for raw materials
and components used in the end products. The detailed schedule indicates the quantities
of each item, when it must be ordered, and when it must be delivered to achieve the

E1C41

Page 966

Chapter 41/Production Planning and Control

master schedule. Capacity requirements planning (Section 41.3.2) coordinates labor and
equipment resources with material requirements.
Material requirements planning is most appropriate for job shop and batch production of products that have multiple components, each of which must be purchased and/or
fabricated. It is the proper technique for determining quantities of dependent demand
items that constitute the inventories of manufacturing: raw materials, purchased parts,
work-in-process, and so forth.
Material requirements planning is relatively straightforward in concept. Its application is complicated by the sheer magnitude of the data that must be processed. The master
schedule specifies the production of final products in terms of month-by-month deliveries.
Each product may contain hundreds of components. These components are produced from
raw materials, some of which are common among the components (e.g., sheet steel for
stampings). Some of the components themselves may be common to several different
products (these are called common use items in MRP). For each product, the components
are assembled into simple subassemblies, which are added to form other subassemblies, and
so on, until the final products are completed. Each step in the sequence consumes time. All
of these factors must be accounted for in material requirements planning. Although each
calculation is simple, the large number of calculations and massive amounts of data require
that MRP be implemented by computer.
The lead time for a job is the time that must be allowed to complete the job from start to
finish. There are two kinds of lead times in MRP: ordering lead times and manufacturing lead
times. Ordering lead time is the time required from initiation of the purchase requisition to
receipt of the item from the vendor. If the item is a raw material stocked by the vendor, the
ordering lead time should be relatively short, perhaps a few weeks. If the item is fabricated, the
lead time may be substantial, perhaps several months. Manufacturing lead time is the time
required to produce the item in the company’s own plant, from order release to completion.

Inputs to the MRP System For the MRP processor to function properly, it must receive
inputs from several files: (1) master production schedule, (2) product design data, in the
form of a bill of materials file, (3) inventory records, and (4) capacity requirements
planning. Figure 41.1 shows the data flow into the MRP processor and the recipients of its
output reports.
The master production schedule was discussed in Section 41.1. The bill-of-materials
file lists the component parts and subassemblies that make up each product. It is used to
compute the requirements for raw materials and components used in the end products listed
in the master schedule. Figure 41.4 shows a (simplified) structure of an assembled product.
The product consists of two subassemblies, each consisting of three parts. The number of each
item in the next level above in the product structure is indicated in parentheses.
The inventory record file identifies each item (by part number) and provides a timephased record of its inventory status. This means that not only is the current quantity of the item
listed, but also any future changes in inventory status that will occur and when they will occur.

These data include gross requirements for the item (how many units will be needed to build
products in the master schedule), scheduled receipts, on-hand status, and planned order
releases. Each of these data sets indicates the changes by time period in the schedule (e.g.,
month, week).

How MRP Works Based on inputs from the master schedule, bill-of-materials file, and
inventory record file, the MRP processor computes how many of each component and raw
material will be needed in future time periods by ‘‘exploding’’ the end product schedule into
successively lower levels in the product structure. The MRP computations must deal with
several complicating factors. First, component and subassembly quantities must be adjusted
for any inventories on hand or on order. Second, quantities of common use items must be
combined during parts explosion to obtain a total requirement for each component and raw
material in the schedule. Third, the time-phased delivery of end products must be converted
into time-phased requirements for components and materials by factoring in the appropriate
lead times. For every unit of final product listed in the MPS, the required number of
components of each type must be ordered or fabricated, taking into account its ordering or
manufacturing lead times. For each component, the raw material must be ordered, accounting for its ordering lead time. And assembly lead times must be considered in the scheduling
of subassemblies and final products.

Example 41.2
Material
Requirements
Planning

Consider the requirements planning procedure for one of the components in product P1: C4.
The required deliveries for P1 are indicated in the master production schedule in Table 41.1
(b). According to the product structure in Figure 41.4, two units of C4 are required to make
subassembly S2, and two S2 units are required to make the final product P1. One unit of raw
material M4 is used to make each unit of C4. Ordering, manufacturing, and assembly lead
times for these items are known. For P1 and S2, the lead time is 1 week; for C4, the lead time is
2 weeks; and for M4, the lead time is 3 weeks. The inventory status of M4 is 50 units currently
on hand, and zero units of component C4 and S2. There are no scheduled requirements,
receipts, or order releases indicated in the inventory record for these items. Neither material
M4 nor component C4 is used on any other product—they are not common use items.
Determine the time-phased requirements for M4, C4, and S2 to meet the master schedule for
product P1. Orders for P1 beyond period 10 are ignored in this problem.
Solution: Table 41.2 presents the solution to this MRP problem. Delivery requirements
for P1 must be offset by 1 week to obtain the planned order releases. S2 must be exploded
by 2 units per P1 unit and offset by 1 week to obtain its order release. C4 is exploded by 2
units per S2 unit and offset by 2 weeks to obtain its requirement. And M4 is offset by its 3week ordering time to obtain its release date, taking into account current stock of M4 on
n
hand.

Output Reports and Benefits of MRP MRP generates various output reports that can
be used in planning and managing plant operations. The reports include (1) order releases,
which authorize the placement of orders planned by the MRP system; (2) planned order
releases in future periods; (3) rescheduling notices, indicating changes in due dates for open
orders; (4) cancellation notices, which indicate that certain open orders have been canceled
due to changes in the master schedule; (5) inventory status reports; (6) performance reports;
(7) exception reports, showing deviations from schedule, overdue orders, scrap, and so forth;
and (8) inventory forecasts, which project inventory levels in future periods.
Many benefits are claimed for a well-designed MRP system, including (1) inventory
reductions, (2) faster response to changes in demand, (3) reduced setup and changeover costs,
(4) better machine utilization, (5) improved ability to respond to changes in the master
schedule, and (6) helpful in developing the master schedule. Despite these claims, MRP
systems have been implemented in industry with varying degrees of success. Some of the
reasons for unsuccessful MRP implementations include (1) inappropriate application, (2)
MRP calculations based on inaccurate data, and (3) absence of capacity planning.

41.3.2 CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS PLANNING
Capacity requirements planning is concerned with determining the labor and equipment
requirements needed to meet the master production schedule. It is also concerned with
identifying the firm’s long-term future capacity needs. Capacity planning also serves to identify
production resource limitations so that a realistic master production schedule can be planned.
A realistic master schedule must take into account the manufacturing capabilities of
the plant that is to make the products. The firm must be aware of its production capacity and
must plan for changes in capacity to meet changing production requirements specified in
the master schedule. The relationship between capacity planning and other functions in
production planning and control is shown in Figure 41.1. The master schedule is reduced to
material and component requirements using MRP. These requirements provide estimates
of the required labor hours and other resources needed to produce the components. The
required resources are then compared to plant capacity over the planning horizon. If the
master schedule is not compatible with plant capacity, adjustments must be made either in
the schedule or in plant capacity.

Plant capacity can be adjusted in the short term and in the long term. Short-term
capacity adjustments include (1) employment levels—increasing or decreasing direct labor in
the plant based on changes in capacity requirements; (2) shift hours—increasing or decreasing the number of labor hours per shift through the use of overtime or reduced hours; (3)
number of work shifts—increasing or decreasing the number of shifts worked per production
period by authorizing evening and night shifts and/or weekend shifts; (4) inventory stockpiling—this tactic is used to maintain steady employment levels during slow demand periods;
(5) order backlogs—delaying deliveries to the customer during busy periods when production resources are insufficient to keep up with demand; and (6) subcontracting—contracting
work to outside shops during busy periods or taking in extra work during slack periods.
Long-term capacity adjustments include possible changes in production capacity that
generally require long lead times, including the following types of decisions: (1) new equipment—investments in additional machines, more productive machines, or new types of
machines to match future changes in product design; (2) new plants—construction of new
plants or purchase of existing plants from other companies; and (3) plant closings—closing
plants not needed in the future.

41.4

JUST-IN-TIME AND LEAN PRODUCTION
Just-in-time (JIT) is an approach to production that was developed by Toyota Motors in
Japan to minimize inventories. Work-in-process and other inventories are viewed as waste
that should be eliminated. Inventory ties up investment funds and takes up space. To reduce
this form of waste, the JITapproach includes a number of principles and procedures aimed at
reducing inventories, either directly or indirectly. Indeed, the scope of JIT is so broad that it is
often referred to as a philosophy. JIT is an important component of ‘‘lean production,’’ a
principal goal of which is to reduce waste in production operations (Section 1.5.1). Lean
production can be defined as ‘‘an adaptation of mass production in which workers and work
cells are made more flexible and efficient by adopting methods that reduce waste in all forms.1
Just-in-time procedures have proven most effective in high-volume repetitive manufacturing, such as the automobile industry [4]. The potential for in-process inventory
accumulation in this type of manufacturing is significant because both the quantities of
products and the number of components per product are large. A just-in-time system produces
exactly the right number of each component required to satisfy the next operation in the
manufacturing sequence just when that component is needed—’’just in time.’’ The ideal batch
size is one part. As a practical matter, more than one part are produced at a time, but the batch
size is kept small. Under JIT, producing too many units is to be avoided as much as producing
too few units. This is a production discipline that contrasts with traditional U.S. practice, which
has promoted use of large in-process inventories to deal with problems such as machine
breakdowns, defective components, and other obstacles to smooth production. The U.S.
approach might be described as a ‘‘just-in-case’’ philosophy.
Although the principal theme in JIT is inventory reduction, this cannot simply be
mandated. Several requisites must be pursued to make it possible: (1) stable production
schedules; (2) small batch sizes and short setup times; (3) on-time delivery; (4) defect-free
components and materials; (5) reliable production equipment; (6) pull system of production control; (7) a work force that is capable, committed, and cooperative; and (8) a
dependable supplier base.

Stable Schedule For JIT to be successful, work must flow smoothly with minimal
perturbations from normal operations. Perturbations require changes in operating

procedures—increases and decreases in production rate, unscheduled setups, variations from
the regular work routine, and other exceptions. Perturbations in downstream operations (i.e.,
final assembly) tend to be amplified in upstream operations (i.e., parts feeding). A master
production schedule that remains relatively constant over time is one way of achieving
smooth work flow and minimizing disturbances and changes in production.

Small Batch Sizes and Setup Reduction Two requirements for minimizing inventories are small batch sizes and short setup times. We examined the relationship between batch
size and setup time in the EOQ formula, Eq. (41.5). Instead of using the EOQ formula just to
compute batch quantities, efforts should be focused on reducing setup time, thereby
permitting smaller batches and lower work-in-process levels. Some of the approaches
used to reduce setup time include (1) performing as much of the setup as possible while
the previous job is still running; (2) using quick-acting clamping devices instead of bolts and
nuts; (3) eliminating or minimizing adjustments in the setup; and (4) using group technology
and cellular manufacturing so that similar part styles are produced on the same equipment.
On-Time Delivery, Zero Defects, and Reliable Equipment Success of JIT production requires near perfection in on-time delivery, parts quality, and equipment reliability. The
small lotsizesand partsbuffersused in JITrequireparts to bedelivered beforestock-outsoccur
at downstream stations. Otherwise, production must be suspended at these stations for lack of
parts. If the delivered parts are defective, they cannot be used in assembly. This tends to
promote zero defects in parts fabrication. Workers inspect their own output to make sure it is
right before it proceeds to the next operation. Low work-in-process also requires reliable
production equipment. Machines that break down cannot be tolerated in a JIT production
system. This emphasizes the need for reliable equipment designs and preventive maintenance.
Pull System of Production Control Just-in-time requires a pull system of production
control, in which the order to produce parts at a given workstation comes from the
downstream station that uses those parts. As the supply of parts becomes exhausted at a
given station, it ‘‘places an order’’ at the upstream workstation to replenish the supply. This
order provides the authorization for the upstream station to produce the needed parts. This
procedure, repeated at each workstation throughout the plant, has the effect of pulling parts
through the production system. By contrast, a push system of production operates by
supplying parts to each station in the plant, in effect driving the work from upstream stations
to downstream stations. MRP is a push system. The risk in a push system is to overload the
factory by scheduling more work than it can handle. This results in large queues of parts in
front of machines that cannot keep up with arriving work. A poorly implemented MRP
system, one that does not include capacity planning, manifests this risk.
One famous pull system is the kanban system used by Toyota Motors. Kanban
(pronounced kahn-bahn) is a Japanese word meaning card. The kanban system of production
control is based on the use of cards to authorize production and work flow in the plant. There
are two types of kanbans: (1) production kanbans, and (2) transport kanbans. A production
kanban authorizes production of a batch of parts. The parts are placed in containers, so the
batch must consist of just enough parts to fill the container. Production of additional parts
is not permitted. The transport kanban authorizes movement of the container of parts to
the next station in the sequence.
Refer to Figure 41.5 as we explain how two workstations, one that feeds the other,
operate in a kanban system. The figure shows four stations, but B and C are the stations we
want to focus on here. Station B is the supplier in this pair, and station C is the consumer.
Station C supplies downstream station D. B is supplied by upstream station A. When station
C starts work on a full container, a worker removes the transport kanban from that container
and takes it back to B. The worker finds a full container of parts at B that have just been
produced, removes the production kanban from that container, and places it on a rack at B.

Section 41.5/Shop Floor Control

971

FIGURE 41.5 Operation
of a kanban system
between workstations.

The worker then places the transport kanban in the full container, which authorizes its
movement to station C. The production kanban on the rack at station B authorizes
production of a new batch of parts. Station B produces more than one part style, perhaps
for several other downstream stations in addition to C. The scheduling of work is determined
by the order in which the production kanbans are placed on the rack.
The kanban pull system between stations A and B and between stations C and D
operates the same as it does between stations B and C, described here. This system of
production control avoids unnecessary paperwork. The cards are used over and over
rather than generating new production and transport orders every cycle. An apparent
disadvantage is the considerable labor involvement in material handling (moving the
cards and containers between stations); however, it is claimed that this promotes
teamwork and cooperation among workers.

Workforce and Supplier Base Another requirement of a JIT production system is
workers who are cooperative, committed, and capable of performing multiple tasks. The
workers must be flexible to produce a variety of part styles at their respective stations, to
inspect the quality of their work, and to deal with minor technical problems with the
production equipment so that major breakdowns do not occur.
Just-in-time extends to the material and component suppliers of the company.
Suppliers must be held to the same standards of on-time delivery, zero defects, and other
JIT requisites as the company itself. Some of the vendor policies used by companies to
implement JIT include (1) reducing the total number of suppliers, (2) selecting suppliers
with proven records for meeting quality and delivery standards, (3) establishing long-term
partnerships with suppliers, and (4) selecting suppliers that are located near the company’s
manufacturing plant.

41.5

SHOP FLOOR CONTROL
The third phase in production planning and control (Figure 41.1) is concerned with releasing
production orders, monitoring and controlling progress of the orders, and acquiring up-todate information on order status. The purchasing department is responsible for these
functions among suppliers. The term shop floor control is used to describe these functions
when accomplished in the company’s own factories. In basic terms, shop floor control is
concerned with managing work-in-progress in the factory. It is most relevant in job shop and
batch production, where there are a variety of different orders in the shop that must be
scheduled and tracked according to their relative priorities.
A typical shop floor control system consists of three modules: (1) order release,
(2) order scheduling, and (3) order progress. The three modules and how they relate
to other functions in the factory are depicted in Figure 41.6. They are implemented by a
combination of computer systems and human resources.

Order Release Order release in shop floor control generates the documents needed to
process a production order through the factory. The documents are sometimes called the

and control functions.

shop packet; it typically consists of (1) route sheet, (2) material requisitions to draw the
starting materials from stores, (3) job cards to report direct labor time used on the order,
(4) move tickets to authorize transport of parts to subsequent work centers in the routing,
and (5) parts list—required for assembly jobs. In a traditional factory, these documents
move with the production order and are used to track its progress through the shop. In
modern factories, automated methods such as bar code technology are used to monitor
order status, making some or all of these paper documents unnecessary.
Order release is driven by two principal inputs, as indicated in Figure 41.6: (1) material
requirements planning, which provides the authorization to produce; and (2) engineering
and manufacturing database that indicates product structure and process planning details
required to generate the documents that accompany the order through the shop.

Order Scheduling Order scheduling assigns the production orders to work centers in the
factory. It serves as the dispatching function in production planning and control. In order
scheduling, a dispatch list is prepared indicating which orders should be accomplished at each
work center. It also provides relative priorities for the different jobs (e.g., by showing due
dates for each job). The dispatch list helps the department foreman assign work and allocate
resources to achieve the master schedule.
Order scheduling addresses two problems in production planning and control:
machine loading and job sequencing. To schedule production orders through the factory,

E1C41

973

they must first be assigned to work centers. Assigning orders to work centers is called
machine loading. Loading all of the work centers in the plant is called shop loading. Since
the number of production orders is likely to exceed the number of work centers, each work
center will have a queue of orders waiting to be processed. A given production machine
may have 10 to 20 jobs waiting to be processed.
Job sequencing is the problem of deciding the order in which to process jobs through a
given machine. The processing sequence is decided by means of priorities among the jobs in the
queue. The relative priorities are determined by a function called priority control. Some of the
rules used to establish priorities for production orders in a plant include (1) first-come-firstserve—orders are processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the work center; (2) earliest
due date—orders with earlier due dates are given higher priorities; (3) shortest processing
time—orders with shorter processing times are given higher priorities; (4) least slack time—
orderswiththeleastslackintheirschedulearegivenhigherpriorities(slacktimeisdefinedasthe
difference between the time remaining until due date and the process time remaining); and (5)
critical ratio—orders with the lowest critical ratio are given higher priorities (the critical ratio is
defined as the ratio of the time remaining until due date divided by the process time remaining).
The relative priorities of the orders may change over time. Expected demand could be
higher or lower for certain products, equipment breakdowns could occur, orders could be
cancelled, or there could be defects in raw materials, among other reasons. Priority control
reviews the relative priorities of the production orders and adjusts the dispatch list accordingly. When an order is completed at one work center, it moves to the next machine in its
routing. The order becomes part of the machine loading for the next work center, and priority
control is again used to determine the sequence among jobs to be processed at that machine.

Order Progress Order progress in shop floor control monitors the status of the orders,
work-in-process, and other parameters in the plant that indicate progress and production
performance. The objective in order progress is to provide information to manage production
based on data collected from the factory.
Various techniques are available to collect data from factory operations. The techniques
range from clerical procedures requiring workers to submit paper forms that are later
compiled, to fully automated techniques requiring no human participation. The term factory
data collection system is sometimes used to identify these techniques. More complete
coverage of this topic is presented in [3].
Information presented to management is often summarized in the form of reports. The
reports include (1) work order status reports, which indicate status of production orders,
including the work center where each order is located, processing hours remaining before each
order will be completed, whether the job is on time, and priority level; (2) progress reports that
report shop performance during a certain time period such as a week or month—how many
orders were completed during the period, how many orders should have been completed
during the period but were not completed, and so forth; and (3) exception reports that indicate
deviations from the production schedule, such as overdue jobs. These reports are helpful to
management in deciding resource allocation issues, authorizing overtime, and identifying
problem areas that adversely affect achievement of the master production schedule.

PROBLEMS
Inventory Control
41.1. A product is made to stock. Annual demand is
86,000 units. Each unit costs $9.50 and the annual
holding cost rate is 22%. Setup cost to produce this
product is $800. Determine (a) economic order
quantity and (b) total inventory costs for this
situation.
41.2. Given that annual demand for a product is 20,000
units, cost per unit ¼ $6.00, holding cost rate ¼
2.5%/month, changeover (setup) time between
products averages 2.0 hr, and downtime cost during
changeover ¼ $200/hr, determine (a) economic
order quantity and (b) total inventory costs for
this situation.
41.3. A product is produced in batches. Batch size ¼
2000 units. Annual demand ¼ 50,000 units, and unit
cost of the product ¼ $4.00. Setup time to run a
batch ¼ 2.5 hr, cost of downtime on the affected
equipment is figured at $250/hr, and annual holding
cost rate ¼ 30%. What would the annual savings be
if the product were produced in the economic order
quantity?
41.4. Assembly of a product requires that a component
part be ordered and stocked. Demand for the
product is constant throughout the year at 7800
units annually. The cost to place an order is $95.
The cost of the part is $56 and the holding cost rate
is 22%. When units are ordered, they take two
weeks to arrive. Determine (a) the economic order
quantity and (b) the reorder point. (c) The parts are
prepackaged in multiples of 100. It saves the supplier unpacking and repackaging time if they can
ship in multiples of 100. The supplier has offered to
reduce the price by $1 per unit if even multiples of

100 are purchased. How much would be saved (if
anything) by taking this offer?
41.5. A certain piece of production equipment is used to
produce various components for an assembled
product. To keep in-process inventories low, it is
desired to produce the components in batch sizes of
150 units. Demand for each product is 2500 units
per year. Production downtime costs an estimated
$200/hr. All of the components made on the equipment are of approximately equal unit cost, which is
$9.00. Holding cost rate ¼ 30%/yr. In how many
minutes must the changeover between batches be
completed in order for 150 units to be the economic
order quantity?
41.6. Current setup time on a certain machine is 3.0 hr.
Cost of downtime on this machine is estimated at
$200/hr. Annual holding cost per part made on the
equipment, Ch ¼ $1.00. Annual demand for the
part is 15,000 units. Determine (a) EOQ and (b)
total inventory costs for this data. Also, determine
(c) EOQ and (d) total inventory costs, if the
changeover time could be reduced to 6 minutes.
41.7. The two-bin approach is used to control inventory
for a particular low-cost component. Each bin
holds 1200 units. The annual usage of the component is 45,000 units. Cost to order the component is
around $70. (a) What is the imputed holding cost
per unit for this data? (b) If the actual annual
holding cost per unit is only 7 cents, what lot
size should be ordered? (c) How much more is
the current two-bin approach costing the company
annually, compared to the economic order
quantity?

Material Requirements Planning
41.8. Quantity requirements are to be planned for component C2 in product P1. Required deliveries for
P1 are given in Table 41.1. Ordering, manufacturing, and assembly lead times are as follows: for P1
and C2, the lead time is one week; and for S1 and
M2, the lead time is two weeks. Given the product

Traditionally, quality control (QC) has been concerned with
detecting poor quality in manufactured products and taking
corrective action to eliminate it. QC has often been limited
to inspecting the product and its components, and deciding
whether the dimensions and other features conformed to
design specifications. If they did, the product was shipped.
The modern view of quality control encompasses a broader
scope of activities, including various quality programs such
as statistical process control and Six Sigma as well as modern
inspection technologies such as coordinate measuring machines and machine vision. In this chapter, we discuss these
and other quality and inspection topics that are relevant
today in modern manufacturing operations. Let us begin our
coverage by defining product quality.

42.1 PRODUCT QUALITY
The dictionary defines quality as ‘‘the degree of excellence
which a thing possesses,’’ or ‘‘the features that make something what it is’’—its characteristic elements and attributes.
The American Society for Quality (ASQ) defines quality as
‘‘the totality of features and characteristics of a product or
service that bear on its ability to satisfy given needs’’ [2].
In a manufactured product, quality has two aspects [4]:
(1) product features and (2) freedom from deficiencies.
Product features are the characteristics of the product
that result from design. They are the functional and aesthetic
features of the item intended to appeal to and provide
satisfaction to the customer. In an automobile, these features
include the size of the car, its styling, the finish of the body, gas
mileage, reliability, reputation of the manufacturer, and
similar aspects. They also include the available options for
the customer to choose. The sum of a product’s features
usually defines its grade, which relates to the level in the
market at which the product is aimed. Cars (and most other
products) come in different grades. Some cars provide basic

transportation because that is what some customers want, while others are upscale for
consumers willing to spend more to own a ‘‘better product.’’ The features of a product are
decided in design, and they generally determine the inherent cost of the product. Superior
features and more of them mean higher cost.
Freedom from deficiencies means that the product does what itis supposed to do (within
the limitations of its design features), that it is absent of defects and out-of-tolerance
conditions, and that no parts are missing. This aspect of quality includes components and
subassemblies of the product as well as the product itself. Freedom from deficiencies means
conforming to design specifications, which is accomplished in manufacturing. Although the
inherent cost to make a product is a function of its design, minimizing the product’s cost to the
lowest possible level within the limits set by its design is largely a matter of avoiding defects,
tolerance deviations, and other errors during production. Costs of these deficiencies make a
long list indeed: scrapped parts, larger lot sizes for scrap allowances, rework, reinspection,
sortation, customer complaintsand returns, warrantycosts and customer allowances, lost sales,
and lost good will in the marketplace.
Thus, product features are the aspect of quality for which the design department is
responsible. Product features determine to a large degree the price that a company can
charge for its products. Freedom from deficiencies is the quality aspect for which the
manufacturing departments are responsible. The ability to minimize these deficiencies has
an important influence on the cost of the product. These generalities oversimplify the way
things work, because the responsibility for high quality extends well beyond the design and
manufacturing functions in an organization.

42.2 PROCESS CAPABILITY AND TOLERANCES
In any manufacturing operation, variability exists in the process output. In a machining
operation, which is one of the most accurate processes, the machined parts may appear to
be identical, but close inspection reveals dimensional differences from one part to the
next. Manufacturing variations can be divided into two types: random and assignable.
Random variations are caused by many factors: human variability within each
operation cycle, variations in raw materials, machine vibration, and so on. Individually,
these factors may not amount to much, but collectively the errors can be significant enough to
cause trouble unless they are within the tolerances for the part. Random variations typically
form a normal statistical distribution. The output of the process tends to cluster about the
mean value, in terms of the product’s quality characteristic of interest (e.g., length, diameter).
A large proportion of the population of parts is centered around the mean, with fewer parts
away from the mean. When the only variations in the process are of this type, the process is
said to be in statistical control. This kind of variability will continue so long as the process is
operating normally. It is when the process deviates from this normal operating condition that
variations of the second type appear.
Assignable variations indicate an exception from normal operating conditions.
Something has occurred in the process that is not accounted for by random variations.
Reasons for assignable variations include operator mistakes, defective raw materials, tool
failures, machine malfunctions, and so on. Assignable variations in manufacturing usually
betray themselves by causing the output to deviate from the normal distribution. The
process is no longer in statistical control.
Process capability relates to the normal variations inherent in the output when the
process is in statistical control. By definition, process capability equals 3 standard
deviations about the mean output value (a total of 6 standard deviations),
PC ¼ m  3 s

979

where PC ¼ process capability; m ¼ process mean, which is set at the nominal value of the
product characteristic when bilateral tolerancing is used (Section 5.1.1); and s ¼ standard
deviation of the process. Assumptions underlying this definition are (1) steady state
operation has been achieved and the process is in statistical control, and (2) the output is
normally distributed. Under these assumptions, 99.73% of the parts produced will have
output values that fall within 3.0s of the mean.
The process capability of a given manufacturing operation is not always known, and
experiments must be conducted to assess it. Methods are available to estimate the natural
tolerance limits based on a sampling of the process.
The issue of tolerances is critical to product quality. Design engineers tend to assign
dimensional tolerances to components and assemblies based on their judgment of how size
variations will affect function and performance. Conventional wisdom is that closer tolerances beget better performance. Small regard is given to the cost resulting from tolerances
that are unduly tight relative to process capability. As tolerance is reduced, the cost of
achieving the tolerance tends to increase because additional processing steps may be needed
and/or more accurate and expensive production machines may be required. The design
engineer should be aware of this relationship. Although primary consideration must be given
to function in assigning tolerances, cost is also a factor, and any relief that can be given to the
manufacturing departments in the form of wider tolerances without sacrificing product
function is worthwhile.
Design tolerances must be compatible with process capability. It serves no useful
purpose to specify a tolerance of 0.025 mm (0.001 in) on a dimension if the process
capability is significantly wider than 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Either the tolerance should be
opened further (if design functionality permits), or a different manufacturing process
should be selected. Ideally, the specified tolerance should be greater than the process
capability. If function and available processes prevent this, then sorting must be included in
the manufacturing sequence to inspect every unit and separate those that meet specification from those that do not.
Design tolerances can be specified as being equal to process capability as defined in
Eq. (42.1). The upper and lower boundaries of this range are known as the natural tolerance
limits. When design tolerances are set equal to the natural tolerance limits, then 99.73% of
the parts will be within tolerance and 0.27% will be outside the limits. Any increase in the
tolerance range will reduce the percentage of defective parts.
Tolerances are not usually set at their natural limits by product design engineers;
tolerances are specified based on the allowable variability that will achieve required
function and performance. It is useful to know the ratio of the specified tolerance relative to
the process capability. This is indicated by the process capability index
PCI ¼

T
6s

ð42:2Þ

where PCI ¼ process capability index; T ¼ tolerance range—the difference between upper
and lower limits of the specified tolerance; and 6s ¼ natural tolerance limits. The underlying assumption in this definition is that the process mean is set equal to the nominal design
specification, so that the numerator and denominator in Eq. (42.2) are centered about the
same value.
Table 42.1 shows the effect of various multiples of standard deviation on defect rate
(i.e., proportion of out-of-tolerance parts). The desire to achieve very-low-fraction defect
rates has led to the popular notion of ‘‘six sigma’’ limits in quality control. Achieving Six
Sigma limits virtually eliminates defects in a manufactured product, assuming the process is
maintained within statistical control. As we shall see later in the chapter, Six Sigma quality
programs do not quite live up to their names. Before addressing that issue, let us discuss a
widely used quality control technique: statistical process control.

42.3 STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL
Statistical process control (SPC) involves the use of various statistical methods to assess
and analyze variations in a process. SPC methods include simply keeping records of the
production data, histograms, process capability analysis, and control charts. Control
charts are the most widely used SPC method, and this section will focus on them.
The underlying principle in control charts is that the variations in any process
divide into two types (Section 42.2): (1) random variations, which are the only variations
present if the process is in statistical control, and (2) assignable variations that indicate a
departure from statistical control. It is the objective of a control chart to identify when
the process has gone out of statistical control, thus signaling that some corrective action
should be taken.
A control chart is a graphical technique in which statistics computed from measured
values of a certain process characteristic are plotted over time to determine if the process
remains in statistical control. The general form of the control chart is illustrated in Figure 42.1.
The chart consists of three horizontal lines that remain constant over time: a center, a lower
control limit (LCL), and an upper control limit (UCL). The center is usually set at the
nominal design value. The upper and lower control limits are generally set at 3 standard
deviations of the sample means.
It is highly unlikely that a random sample drawn from the process will lie outside
the upper or lower control limits while the process is in statistical control. Thus, if it
happens that a sample value does fall outside these limits, it is interpreted to mean that
the process is out of control. Therefore, an investigation is undertaken to determine the

reason for the out-of-control condition, with appropriate corrective action to eliminate
the condition. By similar reasoning, if the process is found to be in statistical control, and
there is no evidence of undesirable trends in the data, then no adjustments should be
made since they would introduce an assignable variation to the process. The philosophy,
‘‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’’ is applicable to control charts.
There are two basic types of control charts: (1) control charts for variables and
(2) control charts for attributes. Control charts for variables require a measurement of
the quality characteristic of interest. Control charts for attributes simply require a
determination of whether a part is defective or how many defects there are in the sample.

42.3.1 CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLES
A process that is out of statistical control manifests this condition in the form of significant
changes in process mean and/or process variability. Corresponding to these possibilities,
there are two principal types of control charts for variables: x chart and R chart. The x chart
(call it ‘‘x bar chart’’) is used to plot the average measured value of a certain quality
characteristic for each of a series of samples taken from the production process. It indicates
how the process mean changes over time. The R chart plots the range of each sample, thus
monitoring the variability of the process and indicating whether it changes over time.
A suitable quality characteristic of the process must be selected as the variable to
be monitored on the x and R charts. In a mechanical process, this might be a shaft
diameter or other critical dimension. Measurements of the process itself must be used to
construct the two control charts.
With the process operating smoothly and absent of assignable variations, a series of
samples (e.g., m ¼ 20 or more is generally recommended) of small size (e.g., n ¼ 4, 5, or 6 parts
per sample) are collected and the characteristic of interest is measured for each part. The
following procedure is used to construct the center, LCL, and UCL for each chart:
1. Compute the mean x and range R for each of the m samples.
2. Compute the grand mean 
x, which is the mean of the x values for the m samples; this
will be the center for the x chart.
3. Compute R, which is the mean of the R values for the m samples; this will be the center
for the R chart.
4. Determine the upper and lower control limits, UCL and LCL, for the x and R charts. The
approach is based on statistical factors tabulated in Table 42.2 that have been derived
specifically for these control charts. Values of the factors depend on sample size n. For the x

Eight samples (m ¼ 8) of size 4 (n ¼ 4) have been collected from a manufacturing process
that is in statistical control, and the dimension of interest has been measured for each
part. It is desired to determine the values of the center, LCL, and UCL for x and R charts.
The calculated x values (units are cm) for the eight samples are 2.008, 1.998, 1.993, 2.002,
2.001, 1.995, 2.004, and 1.999. The calculated R values (cm) are, respectively, 0.027, 0.011,
0.017, 0.009, 0.014, 0.020, 0.024, and 0.018.
Solution: The calculation of x and R values above comprise step 1 in our procedure. In
step 2, we compute the grand mean of the sample averages.
x ¼ ð2:008 þ 1:998 þ    þ 1:999Þ=8 ¼ 2:000
In step 3, the mean value of R is computed.
R ¼ ð0:027 þ 0:011 þ    þ 0:018Þ=8 ¼ 0:0175
In step 4, the values of LCL and UCL are determined based on factors in Table 42.2. First,
using Eq. (42.3) for the x chart,
LCL ¼ 2:000  0:729ð0:0175Þ ¼ 1:9872
UCL ¼ 2:000 þ 0:729ð0:0175Þ ¼ 2:0128

The two control charts are constructed in Figure 42.2 with the sample data plotted in the
charts.

42.3.2 CONTROL CHARTS FOR ATTRIBUTES
Control charts for attributes do not use a measured quality variable; instead, they monitor
the number of defects present in the sample or the fraction defect rate as the plotted
statistic. Examples of these kinds of attributes include number of defects per automobile,
fraction of bad parts in a sample, existence or absence of flash in plastic moldings, and
number of flaws in a roll of sheet steel. The two principal types of control charts for
attributes are the p chart, which plots the fraction defect rate in successive samples; and the
c chart, which plots the number of defects, flaws, or other nonconformities per sample.
p Chart In the p chart, the quality characteristic of interest is the proportion (p for
proportion) of nonconforming or defective units. For each sample, this proportion pi is the
ratio of the number of nonconforming or defective items di over the number of units in the

where i is used to identify the sample. If the pi values for a sufficient number of samples are
averaged, the mean value p is a reasonable estimate of the true value of p for the process.
The p chart is based on the binomial distribution, where p is the probability of a
nonconforming unit. The center in the p chart is the computed value of p for m samples

If the value of p is relatively low and the sample size n is small, then the lower control limit
computed by the first of these equations is likely to be a negative value. In this case, let LCL
¼ 0 (the fraction defect rate cannot be less than zero).
c Chart In the c chart (c for count), the number of defects in the sample are plotted over
time. The sample may be a single product such as an automobile, and c ¼ number of quality
defects found during final inspection. Or the sample may be a length of carpeting at the
factory prior to cutting, and c ¼ number of imperfections discovered in that strip. The c
chart is based on the Poisson distribution, where c ¼ parameter representing the number of
events occurring within a defined sample space (defects per car, imperfections per specified
length of carpet). Our best estimate of the true value of c is the mean value over a large
number of samples drawn while the process is in statistical control:

This value of c is used as the center for the control chart. In the Poisson distribution, the

42.3.3 INTERPRETING THE CHARTS
When control charts are used to monitor production quality, random samples are drawn from
the process of the same size n used to construct the charts. For x and R charts, the x and R
values of the measured characteristic are plotted on the control chart. By convention, the
points are usually connected, as in our figures. To interpret the data, one looks for signs that
indicate the process is not in statistical control. The most obvious sign is when x or R (or both)
lie outside the LCL or UCL limits. This indicates an assignable cause such as bad starting
materials, new operator, broken tooling, or similar factors. An out-of-limit x indicates a shift
in the process mean. An out-of-limit R shows that the variability of the process has changed.
The usual effect is that R increases, indicating variability has risen. Less obvious conditions
may reveal process problems, even though the sample points lie within the 3s limits. These
conditions include (1) trends or cyclical patterns in the data, which may mean wear or other
factors that occur as a function of time; (2) sudden changes in average level of the data; and
(3) points consistently near the upper or lower limits.
The same kinds of interpretations that apply to the x chart and R chart are also
applicable to the p chart and c chart.

42.4 QUALITY PROGRAMS IN MANUFACTURING
Statistical process control is widely used for monitoring the quality of manufactured parts
and products. Several additional quality programs are also used in industry, and in this
section we briefly describe four of them: (1) total quality management, (2) Six Sigma,
(3) Taguchi methods, and (4) ISO 9000. These programs are not alternatives to statistical
process control; in fact, the tools used in SPC are included within the methodologies of
total quality management and Six Sigma.

42.4.1 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Total quality management (TQM) is a management approach to quality that pursues
three main goals: (1) achieving customer satisfaction, (2) encouraging the involvement of
the entire workforce, and (3) continuous improvement.

E1C42

11/09/2009

19:34:50

Page 985

Section 42.4/Quality Programs in Manufacturing

985

The customer and customer satisfaction are a central focus of TQM, and products are
designed and manufactured with this focus in mind. The product must be designed with the
features that customers want, and it must be manufactured free of deficiencies. Within the
scope of customer satisfaction is the recognition that there are two categories of customers:
(1) external customers and (2) internal customers. External customers are those who
purchase the company’s products and services. Internal customers are inside the company,
such as the company’s final assembly department which is the customer of the parts
production departments. For the total organization to be effective and efficient, satisfaction must be achieved in both categories of customers.
In TQM, worker involvement in the quality efforts of the organization extends from the
top executives through all levels beneath. There is recognition of the important influence that
product design has on product quality and how decisions made during design affect the quality
that can be achieved in manufacturing. In addition, production workers are made responsible
for the quality of their own output, rather than rely on inspectors to uncover defects after the
parts are already produced. TQM training, including use of the tools of statistical process
control, is provided to all workers. The pursuit of high quality is embraced by every member of
the organization.
The third goal of TQM is continuous improvement; that is, adopting the attitude that
it is always possible to make something better, whether it is a product or a process.
Continuous improvement in an organization is generally implemented using worker teams
that have been organized to solve specific problems that are identified in production. The
problems are not limited to quality issues. They may include productivity, cost, safety, or any
other area of interest to the organization. Team members are selected on the basis of their
knowledge and expertise in the problem area. They are drawn from various departments
and serve part-time on the team, meeting several times per month until they are able to
make recommendations and/or solve the problem. Then the team is disbanded.

42.4.2 SIX SIGMA
The Six Sigma quality program originated and was first used at Motorola Corporation in the
1980s. It has been adopted by many other companies in the United States and was briefly
discussed in Section 1.5 as one of the trends in manufacturing. Six Sigma is quite similar to
total quality management in its emphasis on management involvement, worker teams to
solve specific problems, and the use of SPC tools such as control charts. The major difference
between Six Sigma and TQM is that Six Sigma establishes measurable targets for quality
based on the number of standard deviations (sigma s) away from the mean in the Normal
distribution. Six sigma implies near perfection in the process in the normal distribution. A
process operating at the 6s level in a Six Sigma program produces no more than 3.4 defects
per million, where a defect is anything that might result in lack of customer satisfaction.
As in TQM, worker teams participate in problem-solving projects. A project requires
the Six Sigma team to (1) define the problem, (2) measure the process and assess current
performance, (3) analyze the process, (4) recommend improvements, and (5) develop a
control plan to implement and sustain the improvements. The responsibility of management
in Six Sigma is to identify important problems in their operations and sponsor the teams to
address those problems.
Statistical Basis of Six Sigma An underlying assumption in Six Sigma is that the defects
in any process can be measured and quantified. Once quantified, the causes of the defects
can be identified, and improvements can be made to eliminate or reduce the defects. The
effects of any improvements can be assessed using the same measurements in a before-andafter comparison. The comparison is often summarized as a sigma level; for example, the
process is now operating at the 4.8-sigma level whereas before it was only operating at the

2.6-sigma level. The relationship between sigma level and defects per million (DPM) is
listed in Table 42.3 for a Six Sigma program. We see that the DPM was previously
at 135,666 defects per 1,000,000 in our example, whereas it has now been reduced to
108 DPM.
A traditional measure for good process quality is 3s (three sigma level). It
implies that the process is stable and in statistical control, and the variable representing
the output of the process is normally distributed. Under these conditions, 99.73% of
the output will be within the 3s range, and 0.27% or 2700 parts per million will lie
outside these limits (0.135% or 1350 parts per million beyond the upper limit and the
same number beyond the lower limit). But wait a minute, if we look up 3.0 sigma in
Table 42.3, we find that there are 66,807 defects per million. Why is there a difference
between the standard normal distribution value (2700 DPM and the value given in
Table 42.3 (66,807 DPM)? There are two reasons for this discrepancy. First, the values
in Table 42.3 refer to only one tail of the distribution, so that an appropriate
comparison with the standard normal tables would only use one tail of the distribution
(1350 DPM). Second, and much more significant, is that when Motorola devised the
Six Sigma program, they considered the operation of processes over long periods of
time, and processes over long periods tend to experience shifts from their original
process means. To compensate for these shifts, Motorola decided to adjust the standard
normal values by 1.5s. To summarize, Table 42.3 includes only one tail of the normal
distribution, and it shifts the distribution by 1.5 sigma relative to the standard normal
distribution. These effects can be seen in Figure 42.3.
Measuring the Sigma Level In a Six Sigma project, the performance level of the process
of interest is reduced to a sigma level. This is done at two points during the project: (1) after
measurements have been taken of the process as it is currently operating and (2) after
process improvements have been made to assess the effect of the improvements. This
provides a before-and-after comparison. High sigma values represent good performance;
low sigma values mean poor performance.
To find the sigma level, the number of defects per million must first be determined.
There are three measures of defects per million used in Six Sigma. The first and most
important is the defects per million opportunities (DPMO), which considers that there may
be more than one type of defect that can occur in each unit (product or service). More
complex products are likely to have more opportunities for defects, while simple products
have fewer opportunities. Thus, DPMO accounts for the complexity of the product and
allows entirely different kinds of products or services to be compared. Defects per million
opportunities is calculated using the following equation:
DPMO ¼ 1; 000; 000

where Nd ¼ total number of defects found, Nu ¼ number of units in the population of
interest, and No ¼ number of opportunities for a defect per unit. The constant 1,000,000
converts the ratio into defects per million.
Other measures besides DPMO are defects per million (DPM), which measures all
of the defects found in the population, and defective units per million (DUPM), which
counts the number of defective units in the population and recognizes that there may be
more than one type of defect in any defective unit. The following two equations can be
used to compute DPM and DUPM:

Process

A final assembly plant that makes dishwashers inspects for 23 features that are considered
important for overall quality. During the previous month, 9056 dishwashers were produced.
During inspection, 479 defects among the 23 features were found, and 226 dishwashers had
one or more defect. Determine DPMO, DPM, and DUPM for these data and convert each
to its corresponding sigma level.
Solution:

42.4.3 TAGUCHI METHODS
Genichi Taguchi has had an important influence on the development of quality engineering, especially in the design area—both product design and process design. In this section
we review two of the Taguchi methods: (1) the loss function and (2) robust design. More
complete coverage can be found among our references [5], [10].
The Loss Function Taguchi defines quality as ‘‘the loss a product costs society from the
time the product is released for shipment’’ [10]. Loss includes costs to operate, failure to
function, maintenance and repair costs, customer dissatisfaction, injuries caused by poor
design, and similar costs. Some of these losses are difficult to quantify in monetary terms, but
they are nevertheless real. Defective products (or their components) that are exposed before
shipment are not considered part of this loss. Instead, any expense to the company resulting
from scrap or rework of defective product is a manufacturing cost rather than a quality loss.
Loss occurs when a product’s functional characteristic differs from its nominal or target
value. Although functional characteristics do not translate directly into dimensional features,
the loss relationship is most readily understood in terms of dimensions. When the dimension
of a component deviates from its nominal value, the component’s function is adversely
affected. No matter how small the deviation, there is some loss in function. The loss increases
at an accelerating rate as the deviation grows, according to Taguchi. If we let x ¼ the quality
characteristic of interest and N ¼ its nominal value, then the loss function will be a U-shaped
curve as in Figure 42.4(a). A quadratic equation can be used to describe this curve:
LðxÞ ¼ kðx  N Þ2

where L(x) ¼ loss function; k ¼ constant of proportionality; and x and N are defined above.
At some level of deviation (x2  N) ¼ (x1  N), the loss will be prohibitive, and it is
necessary to scrap or rework the product. This level identifies one possible way of specifying
the tolerance limit for the dimension.
In the traditional approach to quality control, tolerance limits are defined and any
product within those limits is acceptable. Whether the quality characteristic (e.g., the
dimension) is close to the nominal value or close to one of the tolerance limits, it is acceptable.
Trying to visualize this approach in terms analogous to the preceding relation, we obtain the
discontinuous loss function in Figure 42.4(b). The reality is that products closer to the nominal

specification are better quality and will provide greater customer satisfaction. In order to
improve quality and customer satisfaction, one must attempt to reduce the loss by designing
the product and process to be as close as possible to the target value.

Example 42.3
Taguchi Loss
Function

A certain product has a critical dimension that is specified as 20.00  0.04 cm. Repair
records indicate that if the tolerance is exceeded, there is a 75% probability that the
product will be returned to the manufacturer at a cost of $80 for replacement and
shipping. (a) Estimate the constant k in the Taguchi loss function, Eq. (42.13). (b) Using
the loss function constant determined in (a), what would be the value of the loss function
if the company could maintain a tolerance of 0.01 cm instead of 0.04 cm?
Solution: In Eq. (42.13), the value of (x  N) is the tolerance 0.04 cm. The loss is the
expected cost of replacement and shipping, which is calculated as follows:
EfLðxÞg ¼ 0:75ð$80Þ þ 0:25ð0Þ ¼ $60
Using this expected cost in the loss function, the value of k can be determined as
follows:
60 ¼ kð0:04Þ2 ¼ 0:0016k
k ¼ 60=0:0016 ¼ $37; 500
Accordingly, the Taguchi loss function is L(x) ¼ 37,500(x  N).
(b) For a tolerance of 0.01 cm, the loss function is determined as follows:
LðxÞ ¼ 37; 500ð0:01Þ2 ¼ 37; 500ð0:0001Þ ¼ $3:75
This is a significant reduction from the $60.00 using a tolerance of 0.04 cm. n
Robust Design A basic purpose of quality control is to minimize variations. Taguchi
calls the variations noise factors. A noise factor is a source of variation that is impossible
or difficult to control and that affects the functional characteristics of the product. Three
types of noise factors can be distinguished: (1) unit-to-unit, (2) internal, and (3) external.
Unit-to-unit noise factors consist of inherent random variations in the process or
product caused by variability in raw materials, machinery, and human participation.
These are noise factors we have previously called random variations in the process. They
are associated with a production process that is in statistical control.
Internal noise factors are sources of variation that are internal to the product or
process. They include time-dependent factors such as wear of mechanical components,
spoilage of raw materials, and fatigue of metal parts; and operational errors, such as
improper settings on the product or machine tool. An external noise factor is a source of
variation that is external to the product or process, such as outside temperature, humidity,
raw material supply, and input voltage. Internal and external noise factors constitute what
we have previously called assignable variations.
A robust design is one in which the product’s function and performance are relatively
insensitive to variations in design and manufacturing parameters. It involves the design of
both the product and process so that the manufactured product will be relatively unaffected
by all noise factors. An example of a robust product design is an automobile whose ignition
starter works as well in Minneapolis, Minnesota in winter as in Meridian, Mississippi in
summer. An example of robust process design is a metal extrusion operation that produces
good product despite temperature variations in the starting billet.

42.4.4 ISO 9000
ISO 9000 is a set of international standards that relate to the quality of the products (and
services, if applicable) delivered by a given facility. The standards were developed by the

E1C42

11/09/2009

990

19:34:50

Page 990

Chapter 42/Quality Control and Inspection

International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO 9000 establishes standards for the systems and procedures used by the facility that
determine the quality of its products. ISO 9000 is not a standard for the products themselves.
Its focus is on systems and procedures, which include the facility’s organizational structure,
responsibilities, methods, and resources needed to manage quality. ISO 9000 is concerned
with the activities used by the facility to ensure that its products achieve customer satisfaction.
ISO 9000 can be implemented in two ways, formally and informally. Formal implementation means that the facility becomes registered, which certifies that the facility meets
the requirements of the standard. Registration is obtained through a third-party agency that
conducts on-site inspections and reviews the facility’s quality systems and procedures. A
benefit of registration is that it qualifies the facility to do business with companies that require
ISO 9000 registration, which is common in the European Economic Community where
certain products are regulated and ISO 9000 registration is required for companies making
these products.
Informal implementation of ISO 9000 means that the facility practices the standards
or portions thereof simply to improve its quality systems. Such improvements are worthwhile, even without formal certification, for companies desiring to deliver high quality
products.

42.5 INSPECTION PRINCIPLES
Inspection involves the use of measurement and gaging techniques to determine whether a
product, its components, subassemblies, or starting materials conform to design specifications. The design specifications are established by the product designer, and for mechanical
products they refer to dimensions, tolerances, surface finish, and similar features. Dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish were defined in Chapter 5, and many of the measuring
instruments and gages for assessing these specifications were described in that chapter.
Inspection is performed before, during, and after manufacturing. The incoming
materials and starting parts are inspected upon receipt from suppliers; work units are
inspected at various stages during their production; and the final product should be
inspected prior to shipment to the customer.
We should clarify the distinction between inspection and testing, which is a closely
related topic. Whereas inspection determines the quality of the product relative to design
specifications, testing generally refers to the functional aspects of the product. Does the
product operate the way it is supposed to operate? Will it continue to operate for a reasonable
period of time? Will it operate in environments of extreme temperature and humidity? In
quality control, testing is a procedure in which the product, subassembly, part, or material is
observed under conditions that might be encountered during service. For example, a product
might be tested by operating it for a certain period of time to determine whether it functions
properly. If it passes the test, it is approved for shipment to the customer.
Testing of a component or material is sometimes damaging or destructive. In these
cases, the items must be tested on a sampling basis. The expense of destructive testing is
significant, and great efforts are made to develop methods that do not destroy the item.
These methods are referred to as nondestructive testing or nondestructive evaluation.
Inspections divide into two types: (1) inspection by variables, in which the product
or part dimensions of interest are measured by the appropriate measuring instruments;
and (2) inspection by attributes, in which the parts are gauged to determine whether they
are within tolerance limits. The advantage of measuring a part dimension is that data
are obtained about its actual value. The data might be recorded over time and used to
analyze trends in the manufacturing process. Adjustments in the process can be made
based on the data so that future parts are produced closer to the nominal design value.

Section 42.5/Inspection Principles

991

When a part dimension is simply gaged, all that is known is whether it is within tolerance or
too big or too small. On the positive side, gaging can be done quickly and at low cost.

42.5.1 MANUAL AND AUTOMATED INSPECTION
Inspection procedures are often performed manually. The work is usually boring and
monotonous, yet the need for precision and accuracy is high. Hours are sometimes required
to measure the important dimensions of only one part. Because of the time and cost of
manual inspection, statistical sampling procedures are generally used to reduce the need to
inspect every part.
Sampling versus 100% Inspection When sampling inspection is used, the number of
parts in the sample is generally small compared to the quantity of parts produced. The sample
size may be only 1% of the production run. Because not all of the items in the population are
measured, there is a risk in any sampling procedure that defective parts will slip through. One of
the goals in statistical sampling is to define the expected risk; that is, to determine the average
defect rate that will pass through the sampling procedure. The risk can be reduced by increasing
the sample size and the frequency with which samples are collected. But the fact remains that
100% good quality cannot be guaranteed in a sampling inspection procedure.
Theoretically, the only way to achieve 100% good quality is by 100% inspection; thus,
all defects are screened and only good parts pass through the inspection procedure. However,
when 100% inspection is done manually, two problems are encountered. The first is the
expense involved. Instead of dividing the cost of inspecting the sample over the number of
parts in the production run, the unit inspection cost is applied to every part in the batch.
Inspection cost sometimes exceeds the cost of making the part. Second, in 100% manual
inspection, there are almost always errors associated with the procedure. The error rate
depends on the complexity and difficulty of the inspection task and how much judgment is
required by the human inspector. These factors are compounded by operator fatigue. Errors
mean that a certain number of poor quality parts will be accepted and a certain number of
good quality parts will be rejected. Therefore, 100% inspection using manual methods is no
guarantee of 100% good quality product.
Automated 100% Inspection Automation of the inspection process offers a possible way
to overcome the problems associated with 100% manual inspection. Automated inspection is
defined as automation of one or more steps in the inspection procedure, such as (1) automated presentation of parts by an automated handling system, with a human operator
still performing the actual inspection process (e.g., visually examining parts for flaws); (2)
manual loading of parts into an automatic inspection machine; and (3) fully automated
inspection cell in which parts are both presented and inspected automatically. Inspection
automation can also include (4) computerized data collection from electronic measuring
instruments.
Automated 100% inspection can be integrated with the manufacturing process to
accomplish some action relative to the process. The actions can be one or both of the
following: (1) parts sortation, and/or (2) feedback of data to the process. Parts sortation
means separating parts into two or more quality levels. The basic sortation includes two
levels: acceptable and unacceptable. Some situations require more than two levels, such as
acceptable, reworkable, and scrap. Sortation and inspection may be combined in the same
station. An alternative approach is to locate one or more inspections along the processing
line, and instructions are sent to a sortation station at the end of the line indicating what
action is required for each part.
Feedback of inspection data to the upstream manufacturing operation allows
compensating adjustments to be made in the process to reduce variability and improve

E1C42

Chapter 42/Quality Control and Inspection

quality. If inspection measurements indicate that the output is drifting toward one of the
tolerance limits (e.g., due to tool wear), corrections can be made to process parameters to
move the output toward the nominal value. The output is thereby maintained within a
smaller variability range than possible with sampling inspection methods.

42.5.2 CONTACT VERSUS NONCONTACT INSPECTION
There are a variety of measurement and gaging technologies available for inspection. The
possibilities can be divided into contact and noncontact inspection methods. Contact
inspection involves the use of a mechanical probe or other device that makes contact with
the object being inspected. By its nature, contact inspection is usually concerned with
measuring or gaging some physical dimension of the part. It is accomplished manually or
automatically. Most of the traditional measuring and gaging devices described in Chapter
5 relate to contact inspection. An example of an automated contact measuring system is
the coordinate measuring machine (Section 42.6.1).
Noncontact inspection methods utilize a sensor located a certain distance from the
object to measure or gage the desired feature(s). Typical advantages of noncontact
inspection are (1) faster inspection cycles, and (2) avoidance of damage to the part that
might result from contact. Noncontact methods can often be accomplished on the
production line without any special handling. By contrast, contact inspection usually
requires special positioning of the part, necessitating its removal from the production
line. Also, noncontact inspection methods are inherently faster because they employ a
stationary probe that does not require positioning for every part. By contrast, contact
inspection requires positioning of the contact probe against the part, which takes time.
Noncontact inspection technologies can be classified as optical or nonoptical.
Prominent among the optical methods are lasers (Section 42.6.2) and machine vision
(Section 42.6.3). Nonoptical inspection sensors include electrical field techniques, radiation techniques, and ultrasonics (Section 42.6.4).

42.6 MODERN INSPECTION TECHNOLOGIES
Advanced technologies are substituting for manual measuring and gaging techniques in
modern manufacturing plants. They include contact and noncontact sensing methods. We
begin our coverage with an important contact inspection technology: coordinate measuring
machines.

42.6.1 COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINES
A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) consists of a contact probe and a mechanism to
position the probe in three dimensions relative to surfaces and features of a workpart. See
Figure 42.5. The location coordinates of the probe can be accurately recorded as it contacts
the part surface to obtain part geometry data.
In a CMM, the probe is fastened to a structure that allows movement of the probe
relative to the part, which is fixtured on a worktable connected to the structure. The
structure must be rigid to minimize deflections that contribute to measurement errors. The
machine in Figure 42.5 has a bridge structure, one of the most common designs. Special
features are used in CMM structures to build high accuracy and precision into the
measuring machine, including use of low-friction air-bearings and mechanical isolation
of the CMM to reduce vibrations. An important aspect in a CMM is the contact probe and

its operation. Modern ‘‘touch-trigger’’ probes have a sensitive electrical contact that emits
a signal when the probe is deflected from its neutral position in the slightest amount. On
contact, the coordinate positions are recorded by the CMM controller, adjusting for
overtravel and probe size.
Positioning of the probe relative to the part can be accomplished either manually or
under computer control. Methods of operating a CMM can be classified as (1) manual
control, (2) manual computer-assisted, (3) motorized computer-assisted, and (4) direct
computer control.
In manual control, a human operator physically moves the probe along the axes to
contact the part and record the measurements. The probe is free-floating for easy
movement. Measurements are indicated by digital read-out, and the operator can record
the measurement manually or automatically (paper print-out). Any trigonometric
calculations must be made by the operator. The manual computer-assisted CMM is
capable of computer data processing to perform these calculations. Types of computations include simple conversions from U.S customary units to SI, determining the angle
between two planes, and determining hole-center locations. The probe is still freefloating to permit the operator to bring it into contact with part surfaces.

Chapter 42/Quality Control and Inspection

Motorized computer-assisted CMMs power drive the probe along the machine axes
under operator guidance. A joystick or similar device is used to control the motion. Lowpower stepping motors and friction clutches are used to reduce the effects of collisions
between probe and part. The direct computer-control CMM operates like a CNC machine
tool. It is a computerized inspection machine that operates under program control. The
basic capability of a CMM is to determine coordinate values where its probe contacts the
surface of a part. Computer control permits the CMM to accomplish more sophisticated
measurements and inspections, such as (1) determining center location of a hole or cylinder,
(2) definition of a plane, (3) measurement of flatness of a surface or parallelism between
two surfaces, and (4) measurement of an angle between two planes.
Advantages of using coordinate measuring machines over manual inspection methods include (1) higher productivity—a CMM can perform complex inspection procedures
in much less time than traditional manual methods; (2) greater inherent accuracy and
precision than conventional methods; and (3) reduced human error through automation of
the inspection procedure and associated computations [8]. A CMM is a general-purpose
machine that can be used to inspect a variety of part configurations.

42.6.2 MEASUREMENTS WITH LASERS
Recall that laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
Applications of lasers include cutting (Section 26.3.3) and welding (Section 30.4). These
applications involve the use of solid-state lasers capable of focusing sufficient power to melt
or sublimate the work material. Lasers for measurement applications are low-power gas
lasers such as helium-neon, which emits light in the visible range. The light beam from a
laser is (1) highly monochromatic, which means the light has a single wave length, and (2)
highly collimated, which means the light rays are parallel. These properties have motivated
a growing list of laser applications in measurement and inspection. We describe two here.
Scanning Laser Systems The scanning laser uses a laser beam deflected by a rotating
mirror to produce a beam of light that sweeps past an object, as in Figure 42.6. A
photodetector on the far side of the object senses the light beam during its sweep except
for the short time when it is interrupted by the object. This time period can be measured

quickly with great accuracy. A microprocessor system measures the time interruption that
is related to the size of the object in the path of the laser beam, and converts the time to a
linear dimension. Scanning laser beams can be applied in high production on-line inspection and gaging. Signals can be sent to production equipment to make adjustments in the
process and/or activate a sortation device on the production line. Applications of scanning
laser systems include rolling-mill operations, wire extrusion, machining, and grinding.
Laser Triangulation Triangulation is used to determine the distance of an object from two
known locations by means of trigonometric relationships of a right triangle. The principle can
be applied in dimensional measurements using a laser system, as in Figure 42.7. The laser
beam is focused on an object to form a light spot on the surface. A position-sensitive optical
detector is used to determine the location of the spot. The angle A of the beam directed at the
object and the distance H are fixed and known. Given that the photodetector is located a fixed
distance above the worktable, the part depth D in the setup of Figure 42.7 is determined from
D ¼ H  R ¼ H  L cot A

ð42:14Þ

where L is determined by the position of the light spot on the workpart.

42.6.3 MACHINE VISION
Machine vision involves the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of image data by
computer for some useful application. Vision systems can be classified as two dimensional or
three dimensional. Two-dimensional systems view the scene as a 2-D image, which is quite
adequate for applications involving a planar object. Examples include dimensional measuring and gaging, verifying the presence of components, and checking for features on a flat (or
almost flat) surface. Three-dimensional vision systems are required for applications requiring
a 3-D analysis of the scene, where contours or shapes are involved. The majority of current
applications are 2-D, and our discussion will focus (excuse the pun) on this technology.
Operation of Machine Vision Systems Operation of a machine vision system consists
of three steps, depicted in Figure 42.8: (1) image acquisition and digitization, (2) image
processing and analysis, and (3) interpretation.
Image acquisition and digitizing is accomplished by a video camera connected to a
digitizing system to store the image data for subsequent processing. With the camera focused
on the subject, an image is obtained by dividing the viewing area into a matrix of discrete
picture elements (called pixels), in which each element assumes a value proportional to the

light intensity of that portion of the scene. The intensity value for each pixel is converted to its
equivalent digital value by analog-to-digital conversion. Image acquisition and digitizing is
depicted in Figure 42.9 for a binary vision system, in which the light intensity is reduced to
either of two values (black or white ¼ 0 or 1), as in Table 42.4. The pixel matrix in our
illustration is only 12  12; a real vision system would have many more pixels for better
resolution. Each set of pixel values is a frame, which consists of the set of digitized pixel values.
The frame is stored in computer memory. The process of reading all the pixel values in a frame
is performed 30 times per second in United States, 25 cycle/s in European systems.
The resolution of a vision system is its ability to sense fine details and features in the
image. This depends on the number of pixels used. Common pixel arrays include 640
(horizontal)  480 (vertical), 1024  768, or 1040  1392 picture elements. The more pixels in
the vision system, the higher its resolution. However, system cost increases as pixel count
increases. Also, time required to read the picture elements and process the data increases with
number of pixels. In addition to binary vision systems, more sophisticated vision systems
distinguish various gray levels in the image that permit them to determine surface characteristics such as texture. Called gray-scale vision, these systems typically use 4, 6, or 8 bits of
memory. Other vision systems can recognize colors.

The second function in machine vision is image processing and analysis. The data for
each frame must be analyzed within the time required to complete one scan (1/30 s or 1/25 s).
Several techniques have been developed to analyze image data, including edge detection and
feature extraction. Edge detection involves determining the locations of boundaries between
an object and its surroundings. This is accomplished by identifying contrast in light intensity
between adjacent pixels at the borders of the object. Feature extraction is concerned with
determining feature values of an image. Many machine vision systems identify an object in
the image by means of its features. Features of an object include area, length, width, or
diameter of the object, perimeter, center of gravity, and aspect ratio. Feature extraction
algorithms are designed to determine these features based on the object’s area and
boundaries. Area of an object can be determined by counting the number of pixels that
make up the object. Length can be found by measuring the distance (in pixels) between two
opposite edges of the part.
Interpretationoftheimageis thethird function. It is accomplished byextractedfeatures.
Interpretation is usually concerned with recognizing the object—identifying the object in the
image by comparing it to predefined models or standard values. One common interpretation
technique istemplate matching, which refers to methods that compare one or more features of
an image with corresponding features of a model (template) stored in computer memory.
Machine Vision Applications The interpretation function in machine vision is generally related to applications, which divide into four categories: (1) inspection, (2) part
identification, (3) visual guidance and control, and (4) safety monitoring.
Inspection is the most important category, accounting for about 90% of all industrial
applications. The applications are in mass production, where the time to program and install
the system can be divided by many thousands of units. Typical inspection tasks include: (1)
dimensional measurement or gaging, which involves measuring or gaging certain dimensions of parts or products moving along a conveyor; (2) verification functions, which
include verifying presence of components in an assembled product, presence of a hole in a
workpart, and similar tasks; and (3) identification of flaws and defects, such as identifying
flaws in a printed label in the form of mislocation, poorly printed text, numbering, or
graphics on the label.
Part identification applications include counting different parts flowing past on a
conveyor, part sorting, and character recognition. Visual guidance and control involves a
vision system interfaced with a robot or similar machine to control the movement of the
machine. Examples include seam tracking in continuous arc welding, part positioning, part
reorientation, and picking parts from a bin. In safety monitoring applications, the vision
system monitors the production operation to detect irregularities that might indicate a
hazardous condition to equipment or humans.

42.6.4 OTHER NONCONTACT INSPECTION TECHNIQUES
In addition to optical inspection methods, there are various nonoptical techniques used in
inspection. These include sensor techniques based on electrical fields, radiation, and
ultrasonics.
Under certain conditions, electrical fields created by an electrical probe can be used
for inspection. The fields include reluctance, capacitance, and inductance; they are affected
by an object in the vicinity of the probe. In a typical application, the workpart is positioned
in a fixed relationship to the probe. By measuring the effect of the object on the electrical
field, an indirect measurement of certain part characteristics can be made, such as
dimensional features, thickness of sheet material, and flaws (cracks and voids below
the surface) in the material.
Radiation techniques use X-ray radiation to inspect metals and weldments. The
amount of radiation absorbed by the metal object indicates thickness and presence of
flaws in the part or welded section. For example, X-ray inspection is used to measure
thickness of sheet metal in rolling (Section 19.1). Data from the inspection is used to
adjust the gap between rolls in the rolling mill.
Ultrasonic techniques use high-frequency sound (>20,000 Hz) to perform various
inspection tasks. One of the techniques analyses the ultrasonic waves emitted by a probe
and reflected off the object. During the setup for the inspection procedure, an ideal test
part is positioned in front of the probe to obtain a reflected sound pattern. This sound
pattern is used as the standard against which production parts are subsequently compared. If the reflected pattern from a given part matches the standard, the part is
accepted. If a match is not obtained, the part is rejected.

Quality Programs
42.16. A foundry that casts turbine blades inspects for
eight features that are considered critical-to-quality. During the previous month, 1236 castings were
produced. During inspection, 47 defects among the
eight features were found, and 29 castings had one
or more defects. Determine DPMO, DPM, and
DUPM in a Six Sigma program for these data
and convert each to its corresponding sigma level.
42.17. In the previous problem, if the foundry desired to
improve its quality performance to the 5.0 sigma level
in all three measures of DPM, how many defects and
defective units would they produce in an annual
production quantity of 15,000 castings? Assume the
same eight features are used to assess quality.
42.18. The inspection department in an automobile final
assembly plant inspects cars coming off the production line against 55 quality features considered
important to customer satisfaction. The department counts the number of defects found per
100 cars, which is the same type of metric used
by a national consumer advocate agency. During a
1-month period, a total of 16,582 cars rolled off the
assembly line. These cars included a total of 6045
defects of the 55 features, which translates to 36.5
defects per 100 cars. In addition, a total of 1955 cars

had one or more of the defects during this month.
Determine DPMO, DPM, and DUPM in a Six
Sigma program for these data and convert each
to its corresponding sigma level.
42.19. A company produces a certain part whose most
important dimension is 37.50  0.025 in. If the
tolerance is exceeded, the customer will return
the part to the manufacturer at a cost of $200 in
rework and replacement expenses. (a) Determine
the constant k in the Taguchi loss function,
Eq. (42.13). (b) The company can add a finish
grinding operation that will allow the tolerance
to be reduced to 0.010 in. Using the loss function
from part (a) what is the value of the loss associated
with this new tolerance?
42.20. The additional operation in the preceding problem
will add $2.00 to the current cost of the part, which
is $13.50. If the rate of returns from the customer at
the tolerance of 0.025 in is 2.1%, and it is
expected to drop to zero returns using the new
tolerance, should the company add the finish grinding operation to the manufacturing sequence for
the part? Answer this question using the basic cost
and return rate data without consideration of the
Taguchi loss function.

24.0000 in. Determine (a) the distance between
the laser and the photodetector when no part is
present and (b) the height of a part when the
distance between the laser and photo-detector is
12.0250 in.
42.22. A laser triangulation system is used to determine

the height of a steel block. The system has a
photosensitive detector that is located 750.000
mm above the working surface and the laser is
mounted at a 30.00 angle from the vertical. With
no part on the worktable, the position of the laser
reflection on the photo sensor is recorded. After a
part is placed on the worktable, the laser reflection
shifts 70.000 mm toward the laser. Determine the
height of the object.

CONVERSION BETWEEN USCS AND SI
To convert from USCS to SI: To convert the value of a variable from USCS units to equivalent SI units, multiply the
value to be converted by the right-hand side of the corresponding equivalency statement in the Table of
Equivalencies.

Example: Convert a length L ¼ 3.25 in to its equivalent value in millimeters.
Solution: The corresponding equivalency statement is: 1.0 in ¼ 25.4 mm
L ¼ 3:25 in  (25:4 mm/in) ¼ 82:55 mm
To convert from SI to USCS: To convert the value of a variable from SI units to equivalent USCS units, divide the value to
n
be converted by the right-hand side of the corresponding equivalency statement in the Table of Equivalencies.

Example: Convert an area A ¼ 1000 mm2 to its equivalent in square inches.
Solution: The corresponding equivalency statement is: 1.0 in2 ¼ 645.16 mm2
A ¼ 1000 mm2 /(645:16 mm2 /in2 ) ¼ 1:55 in2
