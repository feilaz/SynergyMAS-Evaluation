Chapter 1: Signs You REALLY Need a CRM

What is CRM?
CRM is much more than a buzzy acronym that’s been tossed around
the business and sales world for the past decade or so.

C-R-M stands for “Customer Relationship Management.”

Conclusion

With a CRM application, there’s no secret formula. It simply manages
most of your critical customer information so that you can see it all
in one place. Without leaving the app, you can view contact info,
follow up via email or social media, manage tasks, and track your
performance, among other benefits. Implementing the right CRM can
increase sales efficiency. You can close more deals, boost sales, and
improve forecast accuracy.

Chapter 1: Signs You REALLY Need a CRM
Small businesses typically begin with a basic relationship of seller-to-customer — simple.
In such an early stage, it might be fine to just maintain an Excel spreadsheet or jot down
notes about customers and incoming orders. But as your business grows, this sort of record
keeping simply can’t do what you need anymore.
Here are some warning signs it’s time to trade in those old ways and start managing your
customer relationships more effectively:

1. There’s no single source for info.
Storing your customer and order info in more than one location, such as a spreadsheet or
notes stuck to your computer, puts your sales team at a disadvantage. They lack a single
view of every customer’s contact info, orders, and interactions.

2. There’s little or no visibility.
Not only do you lack visibility into how your customers are connecting with employees, you
also lack insight into what your sales people are doing. This makes it difficult to help them be
successful -- and keep them accountable.

3. Reports are tedious and painful.
Generating reports and analytics of your sales team’s monthly progress against their
quota would be ideal. But creating reports manually is cumbersome, often resulting in
no tracking at all.

4. You are losing data.
It’s hard for you to schedule follow-ups with customers and prospects. Great meetings
happen on the road, but the sales teams don’t always transfer their notes and important
details get lost, especially if an employee leaves the company.

5. It’s hard to stay in touch on the go.
Your sales reps are out in the field, meeting prospects and discovering valuable info. But all
this new data gets stored on handwritten notes or in files on personal computers, instead of
being shared with the team.

6. Every customer is treated the same.
You don’t target prospects based on their value to the business. Rather, you are sending the
same types of offers and messages to customers and prospects in very different stages of
the buying process, as well as in different industries or geographies.

7. You lack a plan to scale fast.
What if your business grew from 20 to 200 this year? Are you confident that your current
processes will scale? If you know that you are going to grow, are you worried about keeping
productivity up while scaling up?
If any of these apply to you or your team, don’t despair. These are exactly the issues that a
CRM system can address.
Next up, let’s take a look at how a CRM can make your business more productive.

Chapter 2: How CRM Improves Productivity
You probably know the old saying, “there never seems to be enough hours in the day.” This
is especially true in the sales world, where time truly is money. According to a study by
Mavenlink, two out of five small business owners rank time as their most valuable asset, and
a quarter of those would pay $500 for just one extra hour in the day.
The more effectively and efficiently you use your time, the better results to your bottom line.
Small businesses grow faster by getting better at providing a steady flow of new prospects,
increasing time spent selling, and arming their sales reps with the info they need to close
deals more quickly. That is where a CRM application comes in.

Pipeline
Finding time to bring in a steady flow of new customers can be quite the challenge for a
small business sales team. This is often caused by issues such as:
•
•
•
•

Inability to route leads to the appropriate sales rep
Lack of information on potential clients
Inadequate knowledge about a prospect before calling
Poor visibility and forecasting of future pipeline

A CRM app allows sales reps to store the data on prospects so the information’s ready at
each interaction. Plus, it quickly provides metrics related to visibility and forecasting.

Selling Time
Obviously, representatives need time to sell. Some of the time traps faced by salespeople are
hard to overcome, but others can be easily fixed:
• Communication is always a huge challenge for a sales team on the go, but surprisingly
few take advantage of smartphones and tablets, which eliminate downtime and increase
communication.
• Automation of repetitive tasks gives salespeople more time to concentrate on closing.
• Providing one channel for reps to share information and connect eliminates endless email
loops and phone tag.
The right CRM system syncs with mobile devices anywhere, anytime via the cloud, so the entire
team is on the same page and has the most current information at their fingertips.

Knowledge
For successful prospecting and pitching, you must gather vital information on potential clients.
But finding time to do that can be hard when you’re also trying to make your month.
CRMs help solve this problem by collecting valuable customer data, including:
• Client history
• Current client preferences
• Client social media presence
• Past interactions with a client
• Client infrastructure details
• Client social media presence
• Past sales interactions
Now that you’ve seen the value of a CRM system, let’s investigate best practices
for getting a CRM strategy in place.

Chapter 3: How to Craft a CRM Strategy
Building a successful CRM system isn’t just about choosing the right technology, as significant
as that is. You also need the right plan in place from a business perspective. Here are seven basic
steps to build a winning plan:

1. Define Your Vision
Some people dismiss vision statements as a waste of time, but successful sales leaders know the
value of having a clear, repeatable, action-oriented vision that your team can rally around. Your
vision can be many things, from becoming market leader for sales in your region, to redefining
customer service within your industry. Make it both aspirational enough to have an impact, and
clear enough that the entire organisation can understand it.

2. Define Your Strategy
Strategy is what makes your vision achievable. Say you want to be market leader for sales. Do you
do this by competing on price, or by offering different products, or by emphasising your great
after-sales service?

3. Define Your Business Objectives
Business objectives are where vision and strategy get translated into the day-to-day work. A
common mistake when implementing a new CRM system is to replicate in it all the old business
objectives and processes, complete with their inefficiencies. Instead, view your implementation
as an opportunity to review and optimise how you work.

4. Get Your Team On Board
Executive sponsorship is vital for your CRM vision, strategy and business objectives, and for a
successful rollout. A lack of executive sponsorship is one of the top five contributing factors
to CRM failure.

5. Identify the Metrics
“You can’t manage what you can’t measure” is an adage attributed to many business
thinkers. Metrics should be visible to everyone, and this means creating dashboards for all
levels of the organisation, from sales reps and managers, to the executive team.

6. Prioritise Your Initiatives
You’re not going to get everything done at once, so decide what’s most important to deliver
first. Training is often the priority, so everyone is ready to use the new CRM system as soon as
it is available.

7. Define Your Roadmap
You shouldn’t look at building an effective CRM system as a “big bang” event. Yes, a
successful rollout is vital, but being able to deliver enhancements and new features after you
go live is equally important. Plan beyond launch day and consider what other capabilities
you need to deliver for the business.
Now that your CRM system and strategy are in place, it’s time to see the best ways to
measure and maximise the technology.

Chapter 4: Maximising Your CRM ROI
CRM applications have a proven track record of increasing:
• Sales by up to 29%.
• Sales productivity by up to 24%.
• Forecast accuracy by 42%.
In addition, a study by Nucleus Research found that the average CRM return on investment
(ROI) is $5.60 for every dollar spent.
Here are several best practices to remember when working to maximise your ROI, from CRM
Search’s Karen D. Schwartz:

Choose a Cloud-Based CRM Solution
All major CRM vendors offer cloud versions of their apps. Choosing this software as a service
(SaaS) model means companies no longer have to deal with things like servers, software
issues, and new version upgrades, that on-premise CRM apps demand.

Integrate with Applications that Provide Value
Take advantage of the new business and social applications that are out there, and integrate
them with your CRM system. These include marketing automation and accounting software,
plus key social tools, which allow your company to follow people, information, and groups
on social networks, and capture real-time data.

Allow for Mobile Integration
Make everything accessible on mobile devices for your salespeople on-the-go, so they
can work on the road — things like reviewing correspondence, managing contacts, and
reviewing accounts. The integration should also ideally work with back-office systems, social
networks, and web conferencing.
And so you are fully covered, here are some practices to avoid when working to maximise
your CRM ROI, from CRM Buyer’s Christopher Bucholtz:

Infighting Between Sales & Marketing
CRM data is valuable when used to qualify leads for the sales department and to show
which marketing campaigns lead to closed sales. But these insights can be missed if sales
and marketing don’t work together. Before you do anything else, get both departments in a
room to map out common goals, and to discuss how to use the data.

Generating Reports for the Sake of It
The right CRM application can present data in an almost effortless preformatted report. But
this analysis will do you no good if it is ignored. Take the time to not only read the reports,
but to understand and act on them when needed.

Building “Relationships” with Customers
CRMs are an excellent tool to connect with your customers and build relationships that grow
over time. But don’t just assume that everything is fine and well. Be aware that customers
evolve and change, and your business may need to change with them.

Conclusion
Any successful enterprise should start with a foundation of great customer relationships,
with you the seller, connecting with people who need your product or service.
As your company expands, these connections become more sophisticated. It’s not just a
transaction between the buyer and seller. You also need to share information across various
teams within your own organisation who are making contact with the same customers. A
CRM system can serve as a vital nerve center to manage the many connections needed in a
growing business.
In a world where the most successful companies are customer-focused, CRM apps make the
customer king. In short, CRM apps are how businesses truly become “customer companies.”
